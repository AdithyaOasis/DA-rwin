Teil,0,1928,0.0506,118.469,0.779,1928,"God said to Nietzsche: That’ll Tietzsche, You irritating little Krietzsche. ANONYMOUS GRAFFITO  Will Christendom ever reap the whirlwind it has sown? That it should try to pass, without the vulnerability of interval, from a tyranny to a joke, is certainly understandable, but that its enemies should do nothing to obstruct its evasion of nemesis is more puzzling. How can there be such indifference to the decline of our inquisitors? Is it that they succeed so exorbitantly in their project of domestication that we have been robbed of every impulse to bite back? Having at last escaped from the torture-palace of authoritarian love we shuffle about, numb and confused, flinching from the twisted septic wound of our past (now clumsily bandaged with the rags of secular culture). It is painfully evident that post-christian humanity is a pack of broken dogs.  Georges Bataille is the preeminent textual impediment to Christianity’s carefully plotted quiet death; the prolongation of its terminal agonies into the twentieth century. Having definitively exhausted itself after two ugly millennia of species vivisection, Christianity attempts to skulk away from the scene, aided by the fog of supine tolerance which dignifies itself as ‘post-modernity’. It does not take a genius to see whose interests are served by this passage from militant theism to postmodern ambivalence.  A despot abandons any game that begins to turn out badly. This has been the case with metaphysics. From Kant onwards exploratory philosophy ceased to generate the outcomes favourable to established (theistic) power, and we were suddenly told: “this game is over, let’s call it a draw”. The authoritarian tradition of European reason tried to pull the plug on the great voyages at exactly the point they first became interesting, which is to say: atheistic, inhuman, experimental, and dangerous. Schopenhauer – refusing the agnostic stand-off of antinomy – was the first rallying zone for all those disgusted by the contrived peace entitled ‘the end of metaphysics’. Bataille is his most recent successor. The forces of antichrist are emerging fanged and encouraged from their scorched rat-holes in the wake of monotheistic hegemony, without the slightest attachment to the paralytic tinkerings of deconstructive undecidability. ‘An attitude which is neither military nor religious becomes insupportable in principle from the moment of death’s arrival’. <1> The war has scarcely begun.  It is hard to imagine anything more ludicrous than Descartes, or Kant, having erected their humble philosophical dwellings alongside the baroque architectural excesses of the church, standing in the shadows of flying buttresses and asking pompously: how do we know the truth? It surely cannot solely be due to Nietzsche that we see the absurdity of an ‘epistemological’ question being asked in such surroundings. When a philosopher has a priest for a neighbour, which is to say, a practitioner of the most elaborately constructed system of mendacity ever conceived upon earth, how can a commitment to ‘truth’ in a positive sense even be under consideration? Truth in such situations is a privilege of the deaf. There is no question of ‘error’, ‘weakness in reasoning’, or ‘mistaken judgment’ when addressing the authoritative discourses on truth in the western tradition, those cathedrals of theological concept building that ground our ‘common sense’; no, here one can only speak of a deeply rooted and fanatical discipline of lying. In other words, one fraction of the radicality of the atheistic thinking escalated through Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Bataille is that it overthrows the high- bourgeois apologetic-epistemological problematic in modern philosophy by asking clearly for the first time: where do the lies stop?  The great educational value of the war against Christendom lies in the absolute truthlessness of the priest. Such purity is rare enough. The ‘man of God’ is entirely incapable of honesty, and only arises at the point where truth is defaced beyond all legibility. Lies are his entire metabolism, the air he breathes, his bread and his wine. He cannot comment upon the weather without a secret agenda of deceit. No word, gesture, or perception is slight enough to escape his extravagant reflex of falsification, and of the lies in circulation he will instinctively seize on the grossest, the most obscene and oppressive travesty. Any proposition passing the lips of a priest is necessarily totally false, excepting only insidiouses whose message is momentarily misunderstood. It is impossible to deny him without discovering some buried fragment or reality.  There is no truth that is not war against theology, and even the word ‘truth’ has been plastered by the spittle of priestcraft. It cannot be attachment to some alternative conviction that cuts here, but only relentless refusal of what has been told. The dangerous infidels bypass dialectics. It is the sceptic who assassinates the lie.  Whenever its name has been anything but a jest, philosophy has been haunted by a subterranean question: What if knowledge were a means to deepen unknowing? It is this thought alone that has differentiated it from the shallow things of the earth. Yet the glory and also the indignity of philosophy is to have sought the end of knowing, and no more.  Once blatant sophisms are exempted, the fact that scepticism has never been enacted is the sole argument of the dogmatists, and it is a powerful one, despite its empirical flavour. There can be little doubt that the philosophical advocates of disbelief have tended to exploit the very conventions they profess to despise as the shelter for an insincere madness. As was the case with Socrates, philosophy has sought to peel itself away from sophism by admitting to its ignorance, as if unknowing were a pathos to be confessed. Profound ecsanity [‘Ecsane’ – out of one’s mind] alone is effective scepticism, in comparison to which sceptical philosophies fall prey to naïve theories of belief, as if belief could simply be discarded, or withheld. We know nothing of course, but we do not remotely know even this, and mere assertion in no way ameliorates our destitution. Belief is not a possession but a prison, and we continue to believe in achieved knowledge even after denying it with intellectual comprehensiveness. The refusal to accept a dungeon is no substitute for a hole in the wall. Only in a voyage to the unknown is there real escape from conviction.  The dangerous sceptics are those Kant fears, ‘a species of nomads, despising all settled modes of life’ <2> who come from a wilderness tract beyond knowledge. They are explorers, which is also to say: invasion routes of the unknown. It is by way of these inhumanists that the vast abrupt of shamanic zero – the Éποχή of the ancients – infiltrates its contagious madness onto the earth.  Éποχή is a word attributed to Pyrrho by way of indirect reportage, but in its absence the philosopher’s name would lose what slight sense invests it. Although it might be argued that we owe Éποχή to Pyrrho, it is from Éποχή that the name Pyrrho comes to us, as a cryptograph of the unknown. Even were it not for Pyrrho’s silence – a silence far more profound that the literary abstinence of Socrates – Éποχή would surely not be something of which we could straightforwardly know the truth, far less a method, or a subjective state.  Éποχή is a report of the abrupt, and an escape.  1. [ … ] 2. the world of ‘phenomena’ is the adapted world which we feel to be real. The ‘reality’ lies in the continual recurrence of identical, familiar, related things in their logicized character, in the belief that here we are able to reckon and calculate; 3. the antithesis of this phenomenal world is not ‘the true world,’ but the formless unformulable world of the chaos of sensations – another kind of phenomenal world, a kind ‘unknowable’ for us; 4. questions, what things ‘in-themselves’ may be like, apart from our sense receptivity and the activity of our understanding, must be rebutted with the question: how could we know that things exist? ‘Thingness’ was first created by us. The question is whether there could not be many other ways of creating such an apparent world. <3>  How much industrialism lies buried in the notion of thought! As if one could ever work things out. One does not think one’s way out, one gets out, and then sees (that it wasn’t one …).  Bataille’s Nietzsche is not a locus of secular reason but of shamanic religion; a writer who escapes philosophical conceptuality in the direction of ulterior zones, and dispenses with the thing in itself because it is an item of intelligible representation with no consequence as a vector of becoming (of travel). Shamanism defies the transcendence of death, opening the tracts of ‘voyages of discovery never reported’. <4> Against the grain of shallow phenomenalism that characterizes Nietzsche readings, Bataille pursues the fissure of abysmal scepticism, which passes out of the Kantian Noumenon (or intelligible object) through Kant and Schopenhauer’s thing in itself (stripping away a layer of residual Platonism), and onwards in the direction of acategorial, epochal, or base matter that connects with Rimbaud’s ‘invisible splendours’: <5> the immense deathscapes of a ‘universe without images’. <6> Matter cannot be allotted a category without being retrieved for ideality, and the Nietzschean problem with the Ding an Sich was not its supposed dogmatic materialism, but rather that it proposed ‘an ideal form of matter’, <7> as the transcendent (quarantined) site of integral truth, a ‘real world’. There are no things-in-themselves because there are no things: ‘thingness has only been invented by us owing to the requirements of logic’ <8> (which ultimately revert to those of grammar). The Ding an Sich is a concept tailored for a God (supreme being) desperately seeking to hide itself: a cultural glitch turned nasty, but on the run at last. ‘Root of the idea of substance in language, not in beings outside us’! <9>  > The antithesis of the apparent world and the true world is reduced to the antithesis ‘world’ and ‘nothing’. <10>  Materialism is not a doctrine but an expedition, an Alpine break-out from socially policed conviction. It ‘is before anything else the obstinate negation of idealism, which is to say of the very basis of all philosophy’. <11> Exploring acategorial matter navigates thought as chance and matter as turbulence ‘beyond all regulation’. <12> It yields no propositions to judge, but only paths to explore.  This is Nietzsche as a fanged poet at war with the philosophers (with the new priests), a thinker who seeks to make life more problematic. Bataille locks onto a desire that resonates with the reality that confounds us, and not with a ‘rationality’ that would extricate us from the labyrinth. Nietzsche is the great exemplar of complicating thought, exploiting knowledge in the interest of interrogations (and this is not in order to clarify and focus, but to subtilize and dissociate them). Complicating thought strengthens the impetus of an active or energetic confusion – delirium – against the reactive forces whose obsessive tendency is to resolve or conclude. Rebelling against the fundamental drift of philosophical reasoning, it sides with thought against knowledge, against the tranquillizing prescriptions of the ‘will to truth’.  If Nietzsche is locked in an extraordinarily furious struggle with philosophy it is because it is philosophy that has claimed, with the most cynical explicitness, to negate problems. Philosophy has always wanted to retire; Schopenhauer is simply its most honest exemplar. The ‘absolute’ is humanity’s laziest thought. Nor does it suffice to argue that thought can be complicated within itself, or – as the philosophers have said for some time – ‘immanently’, for we know where this path of thinking leads. An intellection in need of immanent critique is one that is already nudging against an ultimate solubility. ‘The intellect finds its limits within itself’ – it does not even need to move to consummate interrogation! It is thinking such as this, whose most eminent model is the Kant of the critical philosophy, that generated such distrust in Nietzsche for writers who work sitting down.  Wisdom (sophia) substitutes for travelling, hollowing it out into a Baudelairean caricature of the Voyage – redundantly reiterating a moral dogma – and to love it is to seek to be still. In obedience to narco-Platonic Eros, philosophy defers to the end of desire. Nietzsche reaches back beyond this Hellenic priest-philosophizing, and forward beyond its modern limit, reassembling sophia as escape:  > Indeed, we philosophers and ‘free spirits’ feel, when we hear the news that ‘the old god is dead,’ as if a new dawn shone on us; our heart overflows with gratitude, amazement, premonitions, expectations. At long last the horizon appears free to us again, even if it should not be bright; at long last our ships may venture out again, venture out to face any danger; all the daring of the lover of knowledge is permitted again; the sea, our sea, lies open again; perhaps there has never yet been such an ‘open sea’. <13>  The death of God is an opportunity, a chance. It makes sense to ask what is meant by the word ‘noumenon’, but ‘chance’ does not function in this way, since it is not a concept to be apprehended, but a direction in which to go. ‘To the one who grasps what chance is, how insipid the idea of God appears, and suspicious, and wing-clipping’! <14> Monotheism is the great gate-keeper, and where it ends the exploration of death begins. If there are places to which we are forbidden to go, it is because they can in truth be reached, or because they can reach us. In the end poetry is invasion and not expression, a trajectory of incineration; either strung-up in the cobwebs of Paradise, or strung-out into the shadow-torrents of hell. It is a route out of creation, which is to each their fate interpreted as enigma, as lure. ‘Now a hard, an inexorable voyage commences – a quest into the greatest possible distance’. <15> ‘I said good-bye to the world’. <16> Even the most angelic curiosity – when multiplied to the power of eternity – must find its way to end in the abyss.  It can seem at times as if Bataille owes almost everything to Christianity; his understanding of the evil at the heart of erotic love, the hysterical affectivity of his writing, along with its excremental obsession, its epileptoid conception of delight, its malignancy, the perpetual stench of the gutter. Yes, this is all very Christian; well attuned to a doctrine gestated in the sewers of the empire. Yet from out of the aberrant intensity and disorder of Bataille’s writings an impossible proposition is perpetually reiterated: that far from being the acme of religion – let alone its telic blossoming – God is the principle of its suppression. The unity of theos is the tombstone of sacred zero, the crumbling granitic foundation of secular destitution. This is so exorbitantly true that the existence of God would be an even greater disaster for him than for us. How infinitely trivial the crucifixion of Jesus appears beside the degrading torture of being God, after all, existence is so indistinguishable from defilement that one turns pale at the very thought of an eternal being’s smell. Perhaps this is why God ‘is profoundly atheistic’, <17> leading Bataille to remark that ‘[w]hilst I am God, I deny him to the depths of negation’ <18> (‘nihilism … might be a divine way of thinking’, <19> Nietzsche anticipates). God can only redeem the universe from its servility by burning his creation into ash and annihilating himself. Such is the ‘God of blinding sun, … this God of death that I sought’. <20> Bataille invokes the dark undertow of a self- butchering divinity: ‘God of despair, give me … your heart … which no longer tolerates that you exist’. <21> (If God is an explorer, then there is no God.)  Bataille’s texts are ‘a hecatomb of words without gods or reason to be’, 22 led back down through the crypts of the West by a furious impulse to dissociate theism and religion, and thus to return the sacred to its shamanic impiety, except that nothing can ever simply return, and Hell will never be an innocent underworld again. The depths have become infernal, really so, quite irrespective of the fairy tales we are still told. ‘[F]lames surround us / the abyss opens beneath our feet’ 23 reports Bataille from the brink of the impossible, ‘an abyss that does not end in the satiate contemplation of an absence’ 24 because its lip is the charred ruin of even the most sublimed subjectivity. ‘I have nothing to do in this world’, he writes, ‘[i]f not to burn’. 25 ‘I suffer from not burning … approaching so close to death that I respire it like the breath of a lover’. 26 It is not only due to the inquisition that all the great voyagers have for a long time been singed. For well over a century all who have wanted to see have seen: no profound exploration can be launched from the ruins of monotheism unless it draws its resources from damnation.  The death of God is a religious event – a transgression, experiment in damnation, and stroke of antitheistic warfare – but this is not to say it is pre-eminently a crime. Hell has no interest in our debauched moral currency. To confuse reactive dabblings in sin with expeditions in damnation is Christian superficiality; the Dantean error of imagining that one could earn oneself an excursion in Hell, as if the infernal too was a matter of justice. Our crimes are mere stumblings on the path to ruin, just as every projected Hell on Earth is a strict exemplar of idolatry. Transgression is not criminal action, but tragic fate; the intersection of an economically programmed apocalypse with the religious antihistory of poetry. It is the inevitable occurrence of impossibility, which is not the same as death, but neither is it essentially different.  This ambivalence responds to that of death ‘itself’, which is not ontological but labyrinthine: a relapse of composition that is absolute to discontinuity, yet is nothing at the level of immanence. The very individuality that would condition the possibility of a proprietary death could only be achieved if death were impossible. One dies because discontinuity is never realized, but this means that there is never ‘one’ who dies. Instead there is an unthinkable communication with zero, immanence, or the sacred. ‘There is no feeling that throws one into exuberance with greater force than that of nothingness. But exuberance is not at all annihilation; it is the surpassing of the shattered attitude, it is transgression’. 27  > The question of the mere ‘truth’ of Christianity – whether in regard of its origin, not to speak of Christian astronomy and natural science – is a matter of secondary importance as long as the question of the value of Christian morality is not considered. 28  What if eternal recurrence were not a belief? (‘The most extreme form of nihilism would be the view that every belief … is necessarily false because there simply is no true world’.) 29 Bataille suggests:  > The return immotivates the instant, freeing life from an end and in this ruining it straight away. The return is … the desert of one for whom each instant henceforth finds itself immotivated. 30  Christianity – the exemplary moral ‘religion’ – ‘substituted slow suicide’ 31 and representation (belief) for shamanic contact with zero-interruption, but with the (re-)emergence of nihilisitic recurrence, caution, prudence, every kind of ‘concern for time to come’ 32 is restored to the senselessness of cosmic ‘noise’. With recurrence comes a ‘future, [which is] not the prolongation of myself across time, but the expiry of a being going further, passing attained limits’. 33 A religious crisis can no longer be deferred.  In the final phase of Nietzsche’s intellectual life the eternal recurrence is grasped as a weapon, a ‘hammer,’ the transmission element between diagnosis and intervention. Where Christendom recuperates decline to preservation, deflecting it from its intensive plummet to zero, eternal recurrence re-opens its abyssal prospect, precipicing affect onto death. This is the predominant sense of ‘selection’ in Nietzsche’s texts; a vertiginous extrication of zero from the series of preservative values, cutting through ‘the ambiguous and cowardly compromise of a religion such as Christianity: more precisely, such as the church: which, instead of encouraging death and self-destruction, protects everything ill-constituted and sick and makes it propagate itself’. 34  The notes assembled into section 55 of The Will to Power develop this morbid thread. Either ‘existence as it is, without meaning or aim, yet recurring inevitably without any finale of nothingness’ (a box), or ‘the nothing (the “meaningless”), eternally’. 35 The nihilism of recurrence is ambivalent between its (Christian) historical sense as the constrictive deceleration of zero and its cosmic (non- local) virtuality as a gateway onto death. Christendom is to be attacked because it was its morality that protected life against despair and the leap into nothing’. 36  > Morality guarded the underprivileged against nihilism … Supposing that the faith in this morality would perish, then the underprivileged would no longer have their comfort – and they would perish. 37  The religious history of mankind is based upon a technics of ill-health: dehydration, starvation, mutilation, deprivation of sleep, a general ‘self-destruction of the underprivileged: self-vivisection, poisoning, intoxication’. 38 A journey was underway which Christian preservative moralism – generalized species cowardice – privatized, representationalized, crushed under the transcendent phallus, froze, obstructed, and drove elsewhere. Christianity is a device for trapping the sick, but recurrence melts through the cages:  > What does ‘underprivileged’ mean? Above all, physiologically – no longer politically. The unhealthiest kind … (in all classes) furnishes the soil for this nihilism: they will experience the belief in the eternal recurrence as a curse, struck by which one no longer shrinks from any action; not to be extinguished but to extinguish everything. 39  To relate sickness to death as cause to effect is itself a sign of health. Their morbid interconnection is quite different. Sickness is not followed by death within the series of ordered representation. It opens the gates.  Genealogy does not reduce sickness to a historical topic, since sickness – the inability to suspend a stimulus – eludes mere unfolding in progressive time, tending towards the disappearance of time in epochal interruption. The reflex-spasm at (and by) which reactivity gropes is the atemporal continuum beneath the crust of health. Death is ‘that which has no history’, 40 and Nietzsche’s method is syphilis. ‘Only religion assures a consumption that destroys the proper substance of those that it animates’. 41  Philosophy is a ghoul that haunts only ruins, and the broken croaks of our hymns to sickness have scarcely begun. Borne by currents of deep exhaustion that flow silent and inexorable beneath the surface perturbations of twitch and chatter, damned, shivering, claw-like fingers hewn from torture and sunk into wreckage drawn with unbearable slowness down into the maw of flame and snuffed blackness twisted skewerish into fever-hollowed eyes. Eternal recurrence is our extermination, and we cling to it as infants to their mother’s breasts.  ‘Poetry leads from the known to the unknown’ writes Bataille, 42 in words that resonate with Rimbaud. Poetry is fluent silence, the only venture of writing to touch upon the sacred (=0), because ‘the unknown … is not distinguished from nothingness by anything that discourse can announce’. 43 To write the edge of the impossible is a transgression against discursive order, and an incitement to the unspeakable: ‘poetry is immoral’. 44  Rimbaud writes from the other side of Zarathustrean descent / death [Untergang], anticipating the labyrinthine spaces of a Nietzsche for the sick, and of what escapes from / due to the cultural convulsion Nietzsche reinforces. ‘The poet makes himself a visionary by a long, immense and rational deregulation of all the senses’, 45 and this deregulation is a source of ‘[i]neffable torture’, 46 ‘the sufferings are enormous’ 47 Rimbaud insists. No organism is adapted to ‘arrive at the unknown’, 48 which makes deregulation as necessary as it makes pain inevitable. Our nerves squeal when they are re-strung upon the phylogenetically unanticipated, ‘experiences strike too deeply; memory becomes a festering wound’: 49 a descent into the inferno. Nuit de l’enfer, where the entrails of nature dissolve meanderous into lava, ‘this is hell, eternal pain’, 50 and Rimbaud burns, ‘as is necessary’. 51  Yes, the poet must be a visionary. The East knows a true lucidity, but to be an inheritor of the West is to hack through jungles of indiscipline, devoured by vile ants and words unstrung from sense, until the dripping foliage of delirium opens out onto a space of comprehensive ruin. This has never been understood, nor can it be. The foulness of our fate only deepens with the centuries, as the tracts of insanity sprawl. From bodies gnawed by tropical fevers we swim out through collapse to inexistence in forever, destined for Undo.  True poetry is hideous, because it is base communication, in contrast to pseudo-communicative discourse, which presupposes the isolation of the terms it unites. Communication – in the transgressive non-sense Bataille lends it – is both an utter risk and an unfathomable degradation, associated with repellent affect. The ego emerges in the flight from communicative immanence, from deep or unholy community, initiating a history that leads to the bitter truth of the desertification of the isolated being. From the anxiety of base contact, which it can only experience as dissolution, the ego stumbles into the ennui of autonomy, the antechamber to a harsh despair, whose horror is accentuated by the fact that it arises at the point where escape has exhausted itself, where the ego has quarantined itself to the limit of its being against extraneous misfortune. Ennui is not any sort of response to the compromising of the ego from without, it is not an impurity or a contamination (the negation of such things are for it a condition of existence), but rather, it is the very truth of achieved being; the core affect of personal individuality. Ennui cannot be mastered, surpassed, resolved, aufgehoben, because it is nothing but the distillate of such operations, indeed, of action as such. Ennui is insinuated into the very fabric of project, as ‘the necessity of leaving oneself’. 52 If the soil of Bataille’s writing is volcanic it is not only due to the sporadic convulsions of a devastating incandescence, but also because its fertility is anticipated by a monstrous sterilization. Beneath and before the luxuriant jungles of delirium is the endless crushing ash-plain of despair.  ‘I believe that I am in hell, therefore I am there’. 53 Blake might have written such words, although their sense would then have been quite different. Drooled from Rimbaud’s pen they point less to a potency of imagination than to a geological crisis of justification, approaching a perfect epistemological irresponsibility. It is not for us to defend the rights of truth, truth is decreed by the masters. What matters is to adapt, nursing the meagre resources of our reactivity, of our base cunning. ‘Belief’ – the cloak of confession – is too precious a resource to be squandered on the zealotry of idealism. What value is there to be extracted from a committed belief, from a last-ditch belief? Such things are for the strong (or for dupes), for the allies and slaves of light, for all those who do not rely on the subterranean passages beneath belief to avoid the panoptic apparatuses. Adaptability can only be lamed by commitments. We have seen enough true Christians: rabbits transfixed by headlights. When draped about the inferiors beliefs are not loyalties, but rather sun-blocks against inquisition. We creatures of shadow are hidden from their enlightenment. We believe exactly what they want.  The inferior race ‘await God with greed’, 54 scavenging at Christ ‘like wolves at an animal they have not killed’. 55 Creation, testamental genealogy, the passion of Christ … none of it is their story, nor is any other, for they are too indolent to have a story of their own, only theft and lies are ‘proper’ to them: ‘pillage’. 56 Rimbaud’s inheritance, ‘above all’, consists of ‘mendacity and sloth’. 57 ‘I have never been a Christian; I am of the race which sung under torture’ 58 he remarks. It is precisely obliviousness to Christianity, to fidelity or duty, to privileged narratives, that eases the inferior race into singing the praises of the Nazarene. The white man has guns, therefore the truth. ‘The whites disembark. The cannon! It is necessary to submit to baptism, dress oneself, work’. 59  In contrast to the pompous declarations of the orthodoxies, which come from on high (like a stroke of the whip), an infernal message is subterranean, a whisper from the nether-regions of discourse, since ‘hell is certainly below’. 60 Just as the underworld is not a hidden world – a real or true [Wahre Welt] – but is that hidden by all worlds, so is the crypt-mutter from hell something other than an inverted scene, concept, or belief. In their infernal lineaments words are passages, leading into and through lost mazes, and not edifications. Acquisition is impossible in hell. There is nothing en bas except wandering amongst emergences, and what is available has always come strangely, without belonging. Infernal low-life has no understanding for property. Even the thoughts of the inferior ones are camouflage and dissimulation, their beliefs mere chameleon dapplings of the skin.  Poetry does not strut logically amongst convictions, it seeps through crevices; a magmic flux resuscitated amongst vermin. If it was not that the Great Ideas had basements, fissures, and vacuoles, poetry would never infest them. Faiths rise and fall, but the rats persist.  Rimbaud’s saison en enfer pulsates through a discourse without integrity. Teaching nothing, it infects. Like matter cooked-through with pestilential ‘contagions of energy’, 61 it collapses into a swarm of plague-vectors. Substance is only its host. ‘[W]ords, books, monuments, symbols, and laughters are nothing but the paths of this contagion, its passages’. 62  I never could conclude anything … Zero does that. Towards New Seas That way is my will; I trust In my mind and in my grip. Without plan, into the vast Open sea I head my ship. All is shining, new and newer, Upon space and time sleeps noon; Only your eye – monstrously, Stares at me, infinity. 63  1 G. Bataille, Oeuvres Complètes, 12 Vols. (Paris: Gallimard, 1970-1988), vol.

I learn from you, I admire you and I love you.  Acknowledgments  This is a small hymn to an exaltation of women. R'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers. Lisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me. Mary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third and passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road. And Molly was right. My daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder. My wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final page. I am blessed among men.   I My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone. When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood. People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years. Above all-we were wet. Out in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve. It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest. From October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages. The rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles. Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the rain. My father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County Antrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head. When I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar. Because of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced. After wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital. My mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth. After a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder? Nobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder. He's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles a bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out. Grandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house. She runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia. Little Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him. My mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse. My grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases. St. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes. Ah, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year. And the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway. Love her as in childhood Though feeble, old and grey. For you'll never miss a mother's love Till she's buried beneath the clay. At the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare. She arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons. With Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler. A knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it. That knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself. Delia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps. Steps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble. Malachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland. Philomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin. Jimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family. Delia said, You shuddup. Tommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself. Och, I am, said Malachy. I am. Nobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap. And while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan. Malachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little talk. Take the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass. Philomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than you are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians. Jimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian. You shuddup, said Delia. Another thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd manner. Malachy smiled. I do? about You do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling. 'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena. Och, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry that girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going. Och, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know. There's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy. You shuddup, said Delia. Malachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani. Bet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River. Malachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it. He awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn. On the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate. Not until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi. There was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house. After baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland. Malachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism. At Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say that... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy. If I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me? I am, Philomena. A year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother. The MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses. Their husbands agreed. I'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw. Up, down, up, down. Malachy goes up. I get off. Malachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is on his mouth and there's blood. Oh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me. And here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly slows her. She says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed? In the middle of the day? She pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off. My father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside the child? did. our building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a dog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth. Malachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood. I pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the dog. Oh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All the same blood. Minnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She tells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature. Mr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child. Will Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die? It was his time, Francis. The apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother shakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other room. My father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white enamel mug. He lifts me to his lap. Dad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo? Cuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story when you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin. I say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a different name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep? Setanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway. That's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall. He finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap. For days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes. Malachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on. In the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother. I try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing. When he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world. She tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening. I wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl. I'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam says, They get their appetites because they're starving half the time. When Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this Could it be true, someone like you Could love me, love me? When Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun. When Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is say a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry. When Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had. All seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad. Come and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you. But Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me, From neither of them shall I part. For one is my mother, God bless her and love her, The other is my sweetheart. Malachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition. When we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips. When Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime? Malachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us, Where are my troops? Where are my four warriors? Mam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey. He comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone who promises to die for Ireland. Deep in Canadian woods we met From one bright island flown. Great is the land we tread, but yet Our hearts are with our own. Up, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up. Mam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her face wet. Can't you leave them alone? she says. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, isn't it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it? She comes to us. Go back to bed, she I want them up, he says. I want them be free from the center to the sea. Don't cross me, she says, for if you your mother's house. a penny in your pocket without says. ready for the day Ireland will do it'll be a sorry day in He pulls his cap down over his face and cries, My poor mother. Poor Ireland. Och, what are we going to do? Mam says, You're pure stone mad, and she tells us again to go to bed. On the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children. Mam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs? He puts on his cap, shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, sighs and looks up at the ceiling. I told you before I'll be home, he says. Later in the day Mam dresses us. She puts the twins into the pram and off we go through the long streets of Brooklyn. Sometimes she lets Malachy sit in the pram when he's tired of trotting along beside her. She tells me I'm too big for the pram. I could tell her I have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but she's not singing and I know this is not the day to be talking about my pains. We come to a big gate where there's a man standing in a box with windows all around. Mam talks to the man. She wants to know if she can go inside to where the men are paid and maybe they'd give her some of Dad's wages so he wouldn't spend it in the bars. The man shakes his head. I'm sorry, lady, but if we did that we'd have half the wives in Brooklyn storming the place. Lotta men have the drinking problem but there's nothing we can do long as they show up sober and do their work. We wait across the street. Mam lets me sit on the sidewalk with my back against the wall. She gives the twins their bottles of water and sugar but Malachy and I have to wait till she gets money from Dad and we can go to the Italian for tea and bread and eggs. When the whistle blows at half five men in caps and overalls swarm through the gate, their faces and hands black from the work. Mam tells us watch carefully for Dad because she can hardly see across the street herself, her eyes are that bad. There are dozens of men, then a few, then none. Mam is crying, Why couldn't ye see him? Are ye blind or what? She goes back to the man in the box. Are you sure there wouldn't be one man left inside? No, lady, he says. They're out. I don't know how he got past you. We go back through the long streets of Brooklyn. The twins hold up their bottles and cry for more water and sugar. Malachy says he's hungry and Mam tells him wait a little, we'll get money from Dad and we'll all have a nice supper. We'll go to the Italian and get eggs and make toast with the flames on the stove and we'll have jam on it. Oh, we will, and we'll all be nice and warm. It's dark on Atlantic Avenue and all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station are bright and noisy. We go from bar to bar looking for Dad. Mam leaves us outside with the pram while she goes in or she sends me. There are crowds of noisy men and stale smells that remind me of Dad when he comes home with the smell of the whiskey on him. The man behind the bar says, Yeah, sonny, whaddya want? You're not supposeta be in here, y'know. I'm looking for my father. Is my father here? Naw, sonny, how'd I know dat? Who's your fawdah? His name is Malachy and he sings Kevin Barry. Malarkey? No, Malachy. Malachy? And he sings Kevin Barry? He calls out to the men in the bar, Youse guys, youse know guy Malachy what sings Kevin Barry? Men shake their heads. One says he knew a guy Michael sang Kevin Barry but he died of the drink which he had because of his war wounds. The barman says, Jeez, Pete, I didn't ax ya to tell me history o' da woild, did I? Naw, kid. We don't let people sing in here. Causes trouble. Specially the Irish. Let 'em sing, next the fists are flying. Besides, I never hoid a name like dat Malachy. Naw, kid, no Malachy here. The man called Pete holds his glass toward me. Here, kid, have a sip, but the barman says, Whaddya doin', Pete? Tryina get the kid drunk? Do that again, Pete, an' I'll come out an' break y'ass. Mam tries all the bars around the station before she gives up. She leans against a wall and cries. Jesus, we still have to walk all the way to Classon Avenue and I have four starving children. She sends me back into the bar where Pete offered me the sip to see if the barman would fill the twins' bottles with water and maybe a little sugar in each. The men in the bar think it's very funny that the barman should be filling baby bottles but he's big and he tells them shut their lip. He tells me babies should be drinking milk not water and when I tell him Mam doesn't have the money he empties the baby bottles and fills them with milk. He says, Tell ya mom they need that for the teeth an' bones. Ya drink water an' sugar an' all ya get is rickets. Tell ya Mom. Mam is happy with the milk. She says she knows all about teeth and bones and rickets but beggars can't be choosers. When we reach Classon Avenue she goes straight to the Italian grocery shop. She tells the man her husband is late tonight, that he's probably working overtime, and would it be at all possible to get a few things and she'll be sure to see him tomorrow? The Italian says, Missus, you always pay your bill sooner or later and you can have anything you like in this store. Oh, she says, I don't want much. Anything you like, missus, because I know you're an honest woman and you got a bunch o' nice kids there. We have eggs and toast and jam though we're so weary walking the long streets of Brooklyn we can barely move our jaws to chew. The twins fall asleep after eating and Mam lays them on the bed to change their diapers. She sends me down the hall to rinse the dirty diapers in the lavatory so that they can be hung up to dry and used the next day. Malachy helps her wash the twins' bottoms though he's ready to fall asleep himself. I crawl into bed with Malachy and the twins. I look out at Mam at the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette, drinking tea, and crying. I want to get up and tell her I'll be a man soon and I'll get a job in the place with the big gate and I'll come home every Friday night with money for eggs and toast and jam and she can sing again Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. The next week Dad loses the job. He comes home that Friday night, throws his wages on the table and says to Mam, Are you happy now? You hang around the gate complaining and accusing and they sack me. They were looking for an excuse and you gave it to them. He takes a few dollars from his wages and goes out. He comes home late roaring and singing. The twins cry and Mam shushes them and cries a long time herself. We spend hours in the playground when the twins are sleeping, when Mam is tired, and when Dad comes home with the whiskey smell on him, roaring about Kevin Barry getting hanged on a Monday morning or the Roddy McCorley song, Up the narrow street he stepped Smiling and proud and young About the hemp rope on his neck The golden ringlets clung, There's never a tear in the blue eyes Both glad and bright are they, As Roddy McCorley goes to die On the bridge of Toome today. When he sings he marches around the table, Mam cries and the twins howl with her. She says, Go out, Frankie, go out, Malachy. You shouldn't see your father like this. Stay in the playground. We don't mind going to the playground. We can play with the leaves piling up on the ground and we can push each other on the swings but then winter comes to Classon Avenue and the swings are frozen and won't even move. Minnie MacAdorey says, God help these poor wee boys. They don't have a glove between them. That makes me laugh because I know Malachy and I have four hands between us and one glove would be silly. Malachy doesn't know what I'm laughing at: He won't know anything till he's four going on five. Minnie brings us in and gives us tea and porridge with jam in it. Mr. MacAdorey sits in an armchair with their new baby, Maisie. He holds her bottle and sings, Clap hands, clap hands, Till Daddy comes home, With buns in his pocket For Maisie alone. Clap hands, clap hands, Till Daddy comes home, For Daddy has money And Mammy has none. Malachy tries to sing that song but I tell him stop, it's Maisie's song. He starts to cry and Minnie says, There, there. You can sing the song. and I song. That's a song for all the children. Mr. MacAdorey smiles at Malachy wonder what kind of world is it where anyone can sing anyone else's Minnie says, Don't frown, Frankie. It makes your face dark and God it's dark enough. Some day you'll have a little sister and you can knows sing that song to her. Och, aye. You'll have a little sister, surely. Minnie is right and Mam gets her wish. There's a new baby soon, a little girl, and they call her Margaret. We all love Margaret. She has black curly hair and blue eyes like Mam and she waves her little hands and chirps like any little bird in the trees along Classon Avenue. Minnie says there was a holiday in heaven the day this child was made. Mrs. Leibowitz says the world never saw such eyes, such a smile, such happiness. She makes me dance, says Mrs. Leibowitz. sings When Dad comes home from looking for a job he holds Margaret and to her: In a shady nook one moonlit night A leprechaun I spied. With scarlet cap and coat of green A cruiskeen by his side. 'Twas tick tock tick his hammer went Upon a tiny shoe. Oh, I laugh to think he was caught at last, But the fairy was laughing, too. He walks around the kitchen with her and talks to her. He tells her how lovely she is with her curly black hair and the blue eyes of her mother. He tells her he'll take her to Ireland and they'll walk the Glens of Antrim and swim in Lough Neagh. He'll get a job soon, so he will, and she'll have dresses of silk and shoes with silver buckles. The more Dad sings to Margaret the less she cries and as the days pass she even begins to laugh. Mam says, Look at him trying to dance with that child in his arms, him with his two left feet. She laughs and we all laugh. The twins cried when they were small and Dad and Mam would say Whisht and Hush and feed them and they'd go back to sleep. But when Margaret cries there's a high lonely feeling in the air and Dad is out of bed in a second, holding her to him, doing a slow dance around the table, singing to her, making sounds like a mother. When he passes the window where the streetlight shines in you can see tears on his cheeks and that's strange because he never cries for anyone unless he has the drink taken and he sings the Kevin Barry song and the Roddy McCorley song. Now he cries over Margaret and he has no smell of drink on him. Mam tells Minnie MacAdorey, He's in heaven over that child. He hasn't touched a drop since she was born. I should've had a little girl a long time ago. Och, they're lovely, aren't they? says Minnie. The little boys are grand, too, but you need a little girl for yourself. My mother laughs, For myself? Lord above, if I didn't nurse her I wouldn't be able to get near her the way he wants to be holding her day and night. Minnie says it's lovely, all the same, to see a man so charmed with his little girl for isn't everyone charmed with her? Everyone. The twins are able to stand and walk and they have accidents all the time. Their bottoms are sore because they're always wet and shitty. They put dirty things in their mouths, bits of paper, feathers, shoelaces, and they get sick. Mam says we're all driving her crazy. She dresses the twins, puts them in the pram, and Malachy and I take them to the playground. The cold weather is gone and the trees have green leaves up and down Classon Avenue. We race the pram around the playground and the twins laugh and make goo-goo sounds till they get hungry and start to cry. There are two bottles in the pram filled with water and sugar and that keeps them quiet for awhile till they're hungry again and they cry so hard I don't know what to do because they're so small and I wish I could give them all kinds of food so that they'd laugh and make the baby sounds. They love the mushy food Mam makes in a pot, bread mashed up in milk and water and sugar. Mam calls it bread and goody. If I take the twins home now Mam will yell at me for giving her no rest or for waking Margaret. We are to stay in the playground till she sticks her head out the window and calls for us. I make funny faces for the twins to stop their crying. I put a piece of paper on my head and let it fall and they laugh and laugh. I push the pram over to Malachy playing on the swings with Freddie Leibowitz. Malachy is trying to tell Freddie all about the way Setanta became Cuchulain. I tell him stop telling that story, it's my story. He won't stop. I push him and he cries, Waah, waah, I'll tell Mam. Freddie pushes me and everything turns dark in my head and I run at him with fists and knees and feet till he yells, Hey, stop, stop, and I won't because I can't, I don't know how, and if I stop Malachy will go on taking my story from me. Freddie pushes me away and runs off, yelling, Frankie tried to kill me. Frankie tried to kill me. I don't know what to do because I never tried to kill anyone before and now Malachy, on the swing, cries, Don't kill me, Frankie, and he looks so helpless I put my arms around him and help him off the swing. He hugs me. I won't tell your story anymore. I won't tell Freddie about Coo, Coo. I want to laugh but I can't because the twins are crying in the pram and it's dark in the playground and what's the use of trying to make funny faces and letting things fall off your head when they can't see you in the dark? The Italian grocery shop is across the street and I see bananas, apples, oranges. I know the twins can eat bananas. Malachy loves bananas and I like them myself. But you need money, Italians are not known for giving away bananas especially to the McCourts who owe them money already for groceries. My mother tells me all the time, Never, never leave that playground except to come home. But what am I to do with the twins bawling with the hunger in the pram? I tell Malachy I'll be back in a minute. I make sure no one is looking, grab a bunch of bananas outside the Italian grocery shop and run down Myrtle Avenue, away from the playground, around the block and back to the other end where there's a hole in the fence. We push the pram to a dark corner and peel the bananas for the twins. There are five bananas in the bunch and we feast on them in the dark corner. The twins slobber and chew and spread banana over their faces, their hair, their clothes. I realize then that questions will be asked. Mam will want to know why the twins are smothered in bananas, where did you get them? I can't tell her about the Italian shop on the corner. I will have to say, A man. That's what I'll say. A man. Then the strange thing happens. There's a man at the gate of the playground. He's calling me. Oh, God, it's the Italian. Hey, sonny, come 'ere. Hey, talkin' to ya. Come 'ere. I go to him. You the kid wid the little bruddas, right? Twins? Yes, sir. Heah. Gotta bag o' fruit. I don' give it to you I trow id out. Right? So, heah, take the bag. Ya got apples, oranges, bananas. Ya like bananas, right? I think ya like bananas, eh? Ha, ha. I know ya like the bananas. Heah, take the bag. Ya gotta nice mother there. Ya father? Well, ya know, he's got the problem, the Irish thing. Give them twins a banana. Shud 'em up. I hear 'em all the way cross the street. Thank you, sir. Jeez. Polite kid, eh? Where ja loin dat? My father told me to say thanks, sir. Your father? Oh, well. Dad sits at the table reading the paper. He says that President Roosevelt is a good man and everyone in America will soon have a job. Mam is on the other side of the table feeding Margaret with a bottle. She has the hard look that frightens me. Where did you get that fruit? The man. What man? The Italian man gave it to me. Did you steal that fruit? Malachy says, The man. The man And what did you do to Freddie Lovely woman. I don't know what we'd And you had to attack poor Freddie. gave Frankie the bag. Leibowitz? His mother was here. do without her and Minnie MacAdorey. Malachy jumps up and down. He din't. He din't. Din't try to kill Freddie. Din't try to kill me. Dad says, Whisht, Malachy, whisht. Come over here. And he takes Malachy on his lap. My mother says, Go down the hall and tell Freddie you're sorry. But Dad says, Do you want to tell Freddie you're sorry? I don't. My parents look at one another. Dad says, Freddie is a good boy. He was only pushing your little brother on the swing. Isn't that right? He was trying to steal my Cuchulain story. Och, now. Freddie doesn't care about the Cuchulain story. He has his own story. Hundreds of stories. He's Jewish. What's Jewish? Dad laughs. Jewish is, Jewish is people with their own stories. They don't need Cuchulain. They have Moses. They have Samson. What's Samson? If you go down and talk to Freddie I'll tell you about Samson later. You can tell Freddie you're sorry and you'll never do it again and you can even ask him about Samson. Anything you like as long as you talk to Freddie. Will you? The baby gives a little cry in my mother's arms and Dad jumps up, dropping Malachy to the floor. Is she all right? My mother says, Of course she's all right. She's feeding. God above, you're a bundle of nerves. They're talking about Margaret now and I'm forgotten. I don't care. I'm going down the hall to ask Freddie about Samson, to see if Samson is as good as Cuchulain, to see if Freddie has his own story or if he still wants to steal Cuchulain. Malachy wants to go with me now that my father is standing and doesn't have a lap anymore. Mrs. Leibowitz says, Oh, Frankie, Frankie, come in, come in. And little Malachy. And tell me, Frankie, what did you do to Freddie? Tried to kill him? Freddie is a good boy, Frankie. Reads his book. Listens to radio with his papa. He swinks you brother on swink. And you try to kill him. Oh, Frankie, Frankie. And you poor mother and her sick baby. She's not sick, Mrs. Leibowitz. Sick she is. Zat is one sick baby. I know from sick babies. I work in hoztipal. Don't tell me, Frankie. Come in, come in. Freddie, Freddie, Frankie is here. Come out. Frankie won't kill you no more. You and little Malachy. Nice Chewish name, have piece cake, eh? Why they give you a Chewish name, eh? So, glass milk, piece cake. You boys so thin, Irish don't eat. We sit at the table with Freddie, eating cake, drinking milk. Mr. Leibowitz sits in an armchair reading the paper, listening to the radio. Sometimes he speaks to Mrs. Leibowitz and I don't understand because strange sounds come from his mouth. Freddie understands. When Mr. Leibowitz makes the strange sounds Freddie gets up and takes him a piece of cake. Mr. Leibowitz smiles at Freddie and pats his head and Freddie smiles back and makes the strange sounds. Mrs. Leibowitz shakes her head at Malachy and me. Oy, so thin. She says Oy so much Malachy laughs and says Oy and the Leibowitzes laugh and Mr. Leibowitz says words we can understand, When Irish oyes are smiling. Mrs. Leibowitz laughs so hard her body shakes and she holds her stomach and Malachy says Oy again because he knows that makes everyone laugh. I say Oy but no one laughs and I know Oy belongs to Malachy the way Cuchulain belongs to me and Malachy can have his Oy. Mrs. Leibowitz, my father said Freddie has a favorite story. Malachy says, Sam, Sam, Oy. Everyone laughs again but I don't because I can't remember what comes after Sam. Freddie mumbles through his cake, Samson, and Mrs. Leibowitz tells him, Don't talk wiz you mouse full, and I laugh because she's grown-up and she says mouse instead of mouth. Malachy laughs because I laugh and the Leibowitzes look at each other and smile. Freddie says, Not Samson. My favorite story is David and the giant, Goliath. David killed him dead with a slingshot, a stone in his head. His brains was on the ground. Were on the ground, says Mr. Leibowitz. Yes, Papa. Papa. That's what Freddie calls his father and Dad is what I call my father. My mother's whisper wakes me. What's up with the child? It's still early and there isn't much morning in the room but you can see Dad over by the window with Margaret in his arms. He's rocking her and sighing, Och. Mam says, Is she, is she sick? Och, she's very quiet and she's a wee bit cold. My mother is out of the bed, taking the child. Go for the doctor. Go for God's sake, and my father is pulling on his trousers over his shirt, no jacket, shoes, no socks on this bitter day. We wait in the room, the twins asleep at the bottom of the bed, Malachy stirring beside me. Frankie, I want a drink of water. Mam rocks in her bed with the baby in her arms. Oh, Margaret, Margaret, my own little love. Open your lovely blue eyes, my little leanv. I fill a cup of water for Malachy and me and my mother wails, Water for you and your brother. Oh, indeed, Water, is it? And nothing for your sister. Your poor little sister. Did you ask if she had a mouth in her head? Did you ask if she'd like a drop of water? Oh, no. Go on and drink your water, you and your brother, as if nothing happened. A regular day for the two of you, isn't it? And the twins sleeping away as if they didn't have a care and their poor little sister sick here in my arms. Sick in my arms. Oh, sweet Jesus in heaven. Why is she talking like this? She's not talking like my mother today. I want my father. Where is my father? I get back into bed and start to cry. Malachy says, Why you cry? Why you cry? till Mam is at me again. Your sister is sick in my arms and you're there whining and whinging. If I go over to that bed I'll give you something to whinge about. Dad is back with the doctor. Dad has the whiskey smell. The doctor examines the baby, prods her, raises her eyelids, feels her neck, arms, legs. He straightens up and shakes his head. She's gone. Mam reaches for the baby, hugs her, turns to the wall. The doctor wants to know, Was there any kind of accident? Did anyone drop the baby? Did the boys play too hard with her? Anything? My father shakes his head. Doctor says he'll have to take her to examine her and Dad signs a paper. My mother begs for another few minutes with her baby but the doctor says he doesn't have all day. When Dad reaches for Margaret my mother pulls away against the wall. She has the wild look, her black curly hair is damp on her forehead and there is sweat all over her face, her eyes are wide open and her face is shiny with tears, she keeps shaking her head and moaning, Ah, no, ah, no, till Dad eases the baby from her arms. The doctor wraps Margaret completely in a blanket and my mother cries, Oh, Jesus, you'll smother her. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me. The doctor leaves. My mother turns to the wall and doesn't make a move or sound. The twins are awake, crying with the hunger, but Dad stands in the middle of the room, staring at the ceiling. His face is white and he beats on his thighs with his fists. He comes to the bed, puts his hand on my head. His hand is shaking. Francis, I'm going out for cigarettes. Mam stays in the bed all day, hardly moving. Malachy and I fill the twins' bottles with water and sugar. In the kitchen we find a half loaf of stale bread and two cold sausages. We can't have tea because the milk is sour in the icebox where the ice is melted again and everyone knows you can't drink tea without milk unless your father gives it to you out of his mug while he's telling you about Cuchulain. The twins are hungry again but I know I can't give them water and sugar all day and night. I boil sour milk in a pot, mash in some of the stale bread, and try to feed them from a cup, bread and goody. They make faces and run to Mam's bed, crying. She keeps her face to the wall and they run back to me, still crying. They won't eat the bread and goody till I kill the taste of the sour milk with sugar. Now they eat and smile and rub the goody over their faces. Malachy wants some and if he can eat it, so can I. We all sit on the floor eating the goody and chewing on the cold sausage and drinking water my mother keeps in a milk bottle in the icebox. After we eat and drink we have to go to the lavatory down the hall but we can't get in because Mrs. Leibowitz is inside, humming and singing. She says, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Won't be two seconds. Malachy claps his hands and dances around, singing, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Mrs. Leibowitz opens the lavatory door. Look at him. Little actor awready. So, chiltren, how's you mother? She's in bed, Mrs. Leibowitz. The doctor took Margaret and my father went for cigarettes. Oh, Frankie, Frankie. I said that was one sick child. Malachy is clutching himself. Have to pee. Have to pee. So, pee awready. You boys pee and we see you mother. After we pee Mrs. Leibowitz comes to see Mam. Oh, Mrs. McCourt. Oy vey, darlink. Look at this. Look at these twins. Naked. Mrs. McCourt, what is mazzer, eh? The baby she is sick? So talk to me. Poor woman. Here turn around, missus. Talk to me. Oy, this is one mess. Talk to me, Mrs. McCourt. She helps my mother sit up against the wall. Mam seems smaller. Mrs. Leibowitz says she'll bring some soup and tells me get some water to wash my mother's face. I dip a towel in cold water and pat her forehead. She presses my hand against her cheeks. Oh, Jesus, Frankie. Oh, Jesus. She won't let my hand go and I'm frightened because I've never seen her like this before. She's saying Frankie only because it's my hand she's holding and it's Margaret she's thinking about, not me. Your lovely little sister is dead, Frankie. Dead. And where is your father? She lets my hand drop. I said where is your father? Drinking. That's where he is. There isn't a penny in the house. He can't get a job but he finds money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink. She rears back, knocks her head on the wall and screams, Where is she? Where is she? Where is my little girl? Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me this night. I'll go mad, so I will, I'll go pure mad. Mrs. Leibowitz rushes in. Missus, missus, what is it? The little girl. Where is she? My mother screams again, Dead, Mrs. Leibowitz. Dead. Her head drops and she rocks back and forth. Middle of the night, Mrs. Leibowitz. In her pram. I should have been watching her. Seven weeks she had in this world and died in the middle of the night, alone, Mrs. Leibowitz, all alone in that pram. Mrs. Leibowitz holds my mother in her arms. Shush, now, shush. Babies go like that. It happens, missus. God takes them. In the pram, Mrs. Leibowitz. Near my bed. I could have picked her up and she didn't have to die, did she? God doesn't want little babies. What is God going to do with little babies? I don't know, missus. I don't know from God. Have soup. Good soup. Make you strong. You boys. Get bowls. I give you soup. What's bowls, Mrs. Leibowitz? Oh, Frankie. You don't know bowl? For the soup, darlink. You don' have a bowl? So get cups for the soup. I mix pea soup and lentil soup. No ham. Irish like the ham. No ham, Frankie. Drink, missus. Drink you soup. She spoons the soup into my mother's mouth, wipes the dribble from her chin. Malachy and I sit on the floor drinking from mugs. We spoon the soup into the twins' mouths. It is lovely and hot and tasty. My mother never makes soup like this and I wonder if there's any chance Mrs. Leibowitz could ever be my mother. Freddie could be me and have my mother and my father, too, and he could have Malachy and the twins for brothers. He can't have Margaret anymore because she's like the dog in the street that was taken away. I don't know why she was taken away. My mother said she died in her pram and that must be like getting hit by a car because they take you away. I wish little Margaret could be here for the soup. I could give it to her with a spoon the way Mrs. Leibowitz is giving it to my mother and she'd gurgle and laugh the way she did with Dad. She wouldn't cry anymore and my mother wouldn't be in the bed day and night and Dad would be telling me Cuchulain stories and I wouldn't want Mrs. Leibowitz to be my mother anymore. Mrs. Leibowitz is nice but I'd rather have my father telling me Cuchulain stories and Margaret chirping and Mam laughing when Dad dances with two left feet. Minnie MacAdorey comes in to help. Mother o' God, Mrs. Leibowitz, these twins smell to the high heavens. I don't know about Mother o' God, Minnie, but these twins need a wash. They need clean diapers. Frankie, where are the clean diapers? I don't know. Minnie says, They're just wearing rags for diapers. I'll get some of Maisie's. Frankie, you take off those rags and throw them out. Malachy removes Oliver's rag and I struggle with Eugene. The safety pin is stuck and when he wriggles it comes loose, sticks him in the hip, and starts him screaming for Mam. But Minnie is back with a towel and soap and hot water. I help her wash away the caked shit and she lets me shake talcum powder on the twins' raw sore skin. She says they're good little boys and she has a big surprise for them. She goes down the hall and brings back a pot of mashed potatoes for all of us. There is plenty of salt and butter in the potatoes and I wonder if there's any chance Minnie could be my mother so that I could eat like this all the time. If I could have Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie for mothers at the same time I'd have no end of soup and mashed potatoes. Minnie and Mrs. Leibowitz sit at the table. Mrs. Leibowitz says something has to be done. These children are running wild and where is the father? I hear Minnie whisper he's out for the drink. Mrs. Leibowitz says terrible, terrible, the way the Irish drink. Minnie says her Dan doesn't drink. Never touches the stuff and Dan told her that when the baby died that poor man, Malachy McCourt, went mad all over Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, that he was thrown out of all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station, that the cops would have thrown him in jail if it was anything else but the death of that lovely little baby. Here he has four lovely little boys, says Minnie, but it's no comfort to him. That little girl brought out something in him. You know he didn't even drink after she was born and that was a miracle. Mrs. Leibowitz wants to know where Mam's cousins are, the big women with the quiet husbands. Minnie will find them and tell them the children are neglected, running wild, sore arses and everything. Two days later Dad returns from his cigarette hunt. It's the middle of the night but he gets Malachy and me out of the bed. He has the smell of the drink on him. He has us stand at attention in the kitchen. We are soldiers. He tells us we must promise to die for Ireland. We will, Dad, we will. All together we sing Kevin Barry, On Mountjoy one Monday morning, High upon the gallows tree, Kevin Barry gave his young life For the cause of liberty. Just a lad of eighteen summers Sure there's no one can deny As he marched to death that morning How he held his head on high. There's a knock at the door, Mr. MacAdorey. Och, Malachy, for God's sake, it's three in the morning. You have the whole house woke with the singing. Och, Dan, I'm only teaching the boys to die for Ireland. You can teach them to die for Ireland in the daytime, Malachy. 'Tis urgent, Dan, 'tis urgent. I know, Malachy, but they're only children. Babies. You go to bed now like a dacent man. Bed, Dan! What am I to do in bed? Her little face is there day and night, her curly black hair and her lovely blue eyes. Oh, Jesus, Dan, what will I do? Was it the hunger that killed her, Dan? Of course not. Your missus was nursing her. God took her. He has his reasons. One more song, Dan, before we go to bed. Good night, Malachy. Come on, boys. Sing. Because he loved the motherland, Because he loved the green He goes to meet a martyr's fate With proud and joyous mien; True to the last, oh! true to the last He treads the upward way; Young Roddy McCorley goes to die On the bridge at Toome today. You'll die for Ireland, won't you, boys? We will, Dad. And we'll all meet your little sister in heaven, won't we, boys? We will, Dad. My brother is standing with his face pressed against a leg of the table and he's asleep. Dad lifts him, staggers across the room, places him in the bed by my mother. I climb into bed and my father, still in his clothes, lies beside me. I'm hoping he'll put his arms around me but he goes on singing about Roddy McCorley and talking to Margaret, Oh, my little curly-haired, blue-eyed love, I would dress you in silks and take you to Lough Neagh, till day is at the window and I fall asleep. That night Cuchulain comes to me. There's a big green bird on his shoulder that keeps singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley and I don't like that bird because there's blood dripping from his mouth when he sings. In one hand Cuchulain carries the gae bolga, the spear that is so mighty only he can throw it. In the other hand he carries a banana, which he keeps offering to the bird, who just squawks and spits blood at him. You'd wonder why Cuchulain puts up with a bird like that. If the twins ever spat blood at me when I offered them a banana I think I'd hit them on the head with it. In the morning my father is at the kitchen table and I tell him my dream. He says there were no bananas in Ireland in the old times and even if there were Cuchulain would never offer one to that bird because that was the one that came over from England for the summer and perched on his shoulder when he was dying and propped up against a stone and when the men of Erin which is Ireland wanted to kill him they were afraid till they saw the bird drinking Cuchulain's blood and then they knew it was safe to attack him, the dirty bloody cowards. So you have to be wary of birds, Francis, birds and Englishmen. Most of the day Mam lies in bed with her face to the wall. If she drinks tea or eats anything she throws up in the bucket under the bed and I have to empty it and rinse it in the lavatory down the hall. Mrs. Leibowitz brings her soup and funny bread that is twisted. Mam tries to slice it but Mrs. Leibowitz laughs and tells her just pull. Malachy calls it pull bread but Mrs. Leibowitz says, No, it's challah, and teaches us how to say it. She shakes her head. Oy, you Irish. You'll live forever but you'll never say challah like a Chew. Minnie MacAdorey brings potatoes and cabbage and sometimes a piece of meat. Och, times are hard, Angela, but that lovely man, Mr. Roosevelt, will find a job for everyone and your husband will have work. Poor man, it's not his fault there's a Depression. He looks for work day and night. My Dan is lucky, four years with the city and he don't drink. He grew up in Toome with your husband. Some drink. Some don't. Curse of the Irish. Now eat, Angela. Build yourself up after your loss. Mr. MacAdorey tells Dad there's work with the WPA and when he gets the work there's money for food and Mam leaves the bed to clean the twins and to feed us. When Dad comes home with the drink smell there's no money and Mam screams at him till the twins cry, and Malachy and I run out to the playground. On those nights Mam crawls back into bed and Dad sings the sad songs about Ireland. Why doesn't he hold her and help her sleep the way he did with my little sister who died? Why doesn't he sing a Margaret song or a song that will dry Mam's tears? He still gets Malachy and me out of bed to stand in our shirts promising to die for Ireland. One night he wanted to make the twins promise to die for Ireland but they can't even talk and Mam screamed at him, You mad oul' bastard, can't you leave the children alone? He'll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel. We get soup from Mrs. Leibowitz and mashed potatoes from Minnie MacAdorey and they show us how to take care of the twins, how to wash their bottoms and how to wash diaper rags after they get them all shitty. Mrs. Leibowitz calls them diapers and Minnie calls them nappies but it doesn't matter what they call them because the twins get them shitty anyway. If Mam stays in the bed and Dad goes out looking for a job we can do what we like all day. We can put the twins in the small swings in the park and swing them till they get hungry and cry. The Italian man calls to me from across the street, Hey, Frankie, c'mere. Watch out crossing da street. Dem twins hungry again? He gives us bits of cheese and ham and bananas but I can't eat bananas anymore after the way the bird spat blood at Cuchulain. The man says his name is Mr. Dimino and that's his wife, Angela, behind the counter. I tell him that's my mother's name. No kiddin', kid. Your mother is Angela? I didn't know the Irish had any Angelas. Hey, Angela, his mother's name is Angela. She smiles. She says, Thatsa nice. Mr. Dimino asks me about Mam and Dad and who cooks for us. I tell him we get food from Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. I tell him all about the diapers and the nappies and how they get shitty anyway and he laughs. Angela, you listenin' to this? Thank God you're Italian, Angela. He says, Kid, I gotta talk to Mrs. Leibowitz. Ya gotta have relations can take care of you. Ya see Minnie MacAdorey, tell her come in see me. You kids runnin' wild. Two big women are at the door. They say, Who are you? I'm Frank. Frank! How old are you? I'm four going on five. You're not very big for your age, are you? I don't know. Is your mother here? She's in the bed. What is she doing in the bed on a fine day in the middle of the day? She's sleeping. Well, we'll come in. We have to talk to your mother. They brush past me into the room. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, the smell of this place. And who are these children? Malachy runs smiling to the big women. When he smiles you can see how white and straight and pretty his teeth are and you can see the shiny blue of his eyes, the pink of his cheeks. All that makes the big women smile and I wonder why they didn't smile when they talked to me. Malachy says, I'm Malachy and this is Oliver and this is Eugene, they're twins, and that's Frankie over there. The big woman with the brown hair says, Well, you're not a bit shy, are you? I'm your mother's cousin, Philomena, and this is your mother's cousin, Delia. I'm Mrs. Flynn and she's Mrs. Fortune and that's what you call us. Good God, says Philomena. Those twins are naked. Don't you have clothes for them? Malachy says, They're all shitty. Delia barks. See. That's what happens. A mouth like a sewer, and no wonder with a father from the North. Don't use that word. That's a bad word, a curse word. You could go to hell using a word like that. What's hell? says Malachy. You'll know soon enough, says Delia. The big women sit at the table with Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. Philomena says it's terrible what happened to Angela's little baby. They heard all about it and you'd wonder, wouldn't you, what they did with the little body. You might wonder and I might wonder but Tommy Flynn didn't wonder. Tommy said that Malachy from the North got money for that baby. Money? says Mrs. Leibowitz. That's right, says Philomena. Money. They take bodies any age and do experiments on them and there's not much left to give back nor would you want back bits of baby when they can't be buried in consecrated ground in that condition. That's terrible, says Mrs. Leibowitz. A father or mother would never give the baby for something like that. They would, says Delia, when they have the craving for the drink. They'd give their own mothers when they have the craving so what's a baby that's dead and gone in the first place? Mrs. Leibowitz shakes her head and rocks in her chair. Oy, she says, oy, oy, oy. The poor baby. The poor mother. I thank God my husband don'have no what you call it? Craving? Right, craving. It's the Irish have the craving. Not my husband, says Philomena. I'd break his face if he came home with the craving. Of course, Delia's Jimmy has the craving. Every Friday night you see him slipping into the saloon. You needn't start insulting my Jimmy, says Delia. He works. He brings home his wages. You'd want to keep an eye on him, says Philomena. The craving could get the better of him and you'd have another Malachy from the North on your hands. Mind your own bloody business, says Delia. At least Jimmy is Irish, not born in Brooklyn like your Tommy. And Philomena has no answer for that. Minnie is holding her baby and the big women say she's a lovely baby, clean, not like this pack of Angela's running around this place. Philomena says she doesn't know where Angela got her dirty habits because Angela's mother was spotless, so clean you could eat your dinner off her floor. I wonder why you'd want to eat your dinner off the floor when you had a table and a chair. Delia says something has to be done about Angela and these children for they are a disgrace, so they are, enough to make you ashamed to be related. A letter has to be written to Angela's mother. Philomena will write it because a teacher in Limerick told her once she had a fine fist. Delia has to tell Mrs. Leibowitz that a fine fist means good handwriting. Mrs. Leibowitz goes down the hall to borrow her husband's fountain pen, paper and an envelope. The four women sit at the table and make up a letter to send to my mother's mother: Dear Aunt Margaret, I take pen in hand to write you this letter and hope this finds you as it leaves us in the best of health. My husband Tommy is in fine form working away and Delia's husband Jimmy is in fine form working away and we hope this finds you in fine form. I am very sorry to tell you that Angela is not in fine form as the baby died, the little girl that was called Margaret after yourself, and Angela has not been the same since lying in the bed with her face to the wall. To make matters worser we think she's expecting again and that's too much altogether. The minute she losses one child there is another one on the way. We don't know how she does it. She's married four years, five children and another on the way. That shows you what can happen when you marry someone from the North for they have no control over themselves up there a bunch of Protestands that they are. He goes out for work every day but we know he spends all his time in the saloons and gets a few dollars for sweeping floors and lifting barrels and spends the money right back on the drink. It's terrible, Aunt Margaret, and we all think Angela and the children would be better off in her native land. We don't have the money to buy the tickets ourselves for times is hard but you might be able to see your way. Hopping this finds you in fine form as it leaves us thank God and His Blessed Mother. I remain your loving neice Philomena Flynn (what was MacNamara) and last but not least your neice Delia Fortune (what was MacNamara, too, ha ha ha) Grandma Sheehan sent money to Philomena and Delia. They bought the tickets, found a steamer trunk at the St. Vincent de Paul Society, hired a van to take us to the pier in Manhattan, put us on the ship, said Good- bye and good riddance, and went away. The ship pulled away from the dock. Mam said, That's the Statue of Liberty and that's Ellis Island where all the immigrants came in. Then she leaned over the side and vomited and the wind from the Atlantic blew it all over us and other happy people admiring the view. Passengers cursed and ran, seagulls came from all over the harbor and Mam hung limp and pale on the ship's rail. II In a week we arrived at Moville, County Donegal, where we took a bus to Belfast and from there another bus to Toome in County Antrim. We left the trunk in a shop and set out to walk the two miles up the road to Grandpa McCourt's house. It was dark on the road, the dawn barely stirring on the hills beyond. Dad carried the twins in his arms and they took turns crying with the hunger. Mam stopped every few minutes to sit and rest on the stone wall along the road. We sat with her and watched the sky turn red and then blue. Birds started to chirp and sing in the trees and as the dawn came up we saw strange creatures in the fields, standing, looking at us. Malachy said, What are they, Dad? Cows, son. What are cows, Dad? Cows are cows, son. We walked farther along the brightening road and there were other creatures in the fields, white furry creatures. Malachy said, What are they, Dad? Sheep, son. What are sheep, Dad? My father barked at him, Is there any end to your questions? Sheep are sheep, cows are cows, and that over there is a goat. A goat is a goat. The goat gives milk, the sheep gives wool, the cow gives everything. What else in God's name do you want to know? And Malachy yelped with fright because Dad never talked like that, never spoke sharply to us. He might get us up in the middle of the night and make us promise to die for Ireland but he never barked like this. Malachy ran to Mam and she said, There, there, love, don't cry. Your father is just worn out carrying the twins and 'tis hard answering all those questions when you're carting twins through the world. Dad set the twins on the road and held out his arms to Malachy. Now the twins started to cry and Malachy clung to Mam, sobbing. The cows mooed, the sheep maaed, the goat ehehed, the birds twittered in the trees, and the beep beep of a motor car cut through everything. A man called from the motor car, Good Lord, what are you people doing on this road at this hour of an Easter Sunday morning? Dad said, Good morning, Father. Father? I said. Dad, is that your father? Mam said, Don't ask him any questions. Dad said, No, no, this is a priest. Malachy said, What's a-? but Mam put her hand over his mouth. The priest had white hair and a white collar. He said, Where are you going? Dad said, Up the road to McCourts of Moneyglass, and the priest took us in his motor car. He said he knew the McCourts, a fine family, good Catholics, some daily communicants, and he hoped he'd see us all at Mass, especially the little Yankees who didn't know what a priest was, God help us. At the house my mother reaches for the gate latch. Dad says, No, no, not that way. Not the front gate. They use the front door only for visits from the priest or funerals. We make our way around the house to the kitchen door. Dad pushes in the door and there's Grandpa McCourt drinking tea from a big mug and Grandma McCourt frying something. Och, says Grandpa, you're here. Och, we are, says Dad. He points to my mother. This is Angela, he says. Grandpa says, Och, you must be worn out, Angela. Grandma says nothing, she turns back to the frying pan. Grandpa leads us through the kitchen to a large room with a long table and chairs. He says, Sit down and have some tea. Would you like boxty? Malachy says, What's boxty? Dad laughs. Pancakes, son. Pancakes made with potatoes. Grandpa says, We have eggs. It's Easter Sunday and you can have all the eggs you can hold. We have tea and boxty and boiled eggs and we all fall asleep. I wake up in a bed with Malachy and the twins. My parents are in another bed over by the window. Where am I? It's getting dark. This is not the ship. Mam snores hink, Dad snores honk. I get up and poke at Dad. I have to pee. He says, Use the chamber pot. What? Under the bed, son. The chamber pot. It has roses on it and maidens cavorting in the glen. Pee in that, son. I want to ask him what he's talking about for even if I'm bursting I feel strange peeing into a pot with roses and maidens cavorting, whatever they are. We had nothing like this in Classon Avenue where Mrs. Leibowitz sang in the lavatory while we clutched ourselves in the hall. Now Malachy has to use the chamber pot but he wants to sit on it. Dad says, No, you can't do that, son. You have to go outside. When he says that I have to go, too, to sit. He leads us downstairs and through the big room where Grandpa is sitting reading by the fire and Grandma is dozing in her chair. It's dark outside, though the moon is bright enough for us to see where we're going. Dad opens the door of a little house that has a seat with a hole in it. He shows Malachy and me how to sit on the hole and how to wipe ourselves with squares of newspaper stuck on a nail. Then he tells us wait while he goes inside, closes the door and grunts. The moon is so bright I can look down the field and see the things called cows and sheep and I wonder why they don't go home. In the house there are other people in the room with my grandparents. Dad says, These are your aunts: Emily, Nora, Maggie, Vera. Your aunt Eva is in Ballymena with children like you. My aunts are not like Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey, they nod their heads but they don't hug us or smile. Mam comes into the room with the twins and when Dad tells his sisters, This is Angela and these are the twins, they just nod again. Grandma goes to the kitchen and soon we have bread and sausages and tea. The only one who speaks at the table is Malachy. He points his spoon at the aunts and asks their names again. When Mam tells him eat his sausage and be quiet his eyes fill with tears and Aunt Nora reaches over to comfort him. She says, There, there, and I wonder why everyone says there there when Malachy cries. I wonder what there there means. It's quiet at the table till Dad says, Things are terrible in America. Grandma says, Och, aye. I read it in the paper. But they say Mr. Roosevelt is a good man and if you stayed you might have work by now. Dad shakes his head and Grandma says, I don't know what you're going to do, Malachy. Things are worse here than they are in America. No work here and, God knows, we don't have room in this house for six more people. Dad says, I thought I might get work on some of the farms. We could get a small place. Where would you stay in the meantime? says Grandma. And how would you support yourself and your family? Och, I could go on the dole, I suppose. You can't get off a ship from America and go on the dole, says Grandpa. They make you wait a while and what would you do while you're waiting? Dad says nothing and Mam looks straight ahead at the wall. You'd be better off in the Free State, says Grandma. Dublin is big and surely there's work there or in the farms around. You're entitled to money from the IRA, too, says Grandpa. You did your bit and they've been handing out money to men all over the Free State. You could go to Dublin and ask for help. We can loan you the bus fare to Dublin. The twins can sit on your lap and you won't have to pay for them. Dad says, Och, aye, and Mam stares at the wall with tears in her eyes. After we ate we went back to bed and next morning, all the grown- ups sat around looking sad. Soon a man came in a motor car and took us back down the road to the shop which had our trunk. They lifted the trunk up on the roof of a bus and we got into the bus. Dad said we were going to Dublin. Malachy said, What's Dublin? but no one answered him. Dad held Eugene on his lap and Mam held Oliver. Dad looked out at the fields and told me this is where Cuchulain liked to go for a walk. I asked him where Cuchulain hit the ball into the dog's mouth and he said a few miles away. Malachy said, Look, look, and we looked. It was a great silvery sheet of water and Dad said it was Lough Neagh, the largest lake in Ireland, the lake where Cuchulain used to swim after his great battles. Cuchulain would get so hot that when he jumped into Lough Neagh it boiled over and warmed the surrounding countryside for days. Some day we'd all come back and go swimming like Cuchulain himself. We'd fish for eels and fry them in a pan not like Cuchulain, who would pluck them from the lough and swallow them, wriggling, because there's great power in an eel. Is that right, Dad? 'Tis. Mam didn't look out the window at Lough Neagh. Her cheek rested on top of Oliver's head and she stared at the floor of the bus. Soon the bus is rolling into a place where there are big houses, motor cars, horses pulling carts, people on bicycles and hundreds walking. Malachy is excited. Dad, Dad, where's the playground, the swings? I want to see Freddie Leibowitz. Och, son, you're in Dublin now, far from Classon Avenue. You're in Ireland, a long way from New York. When the bus stops the trunk is lifted down and set on the floor of the bus station. Dad tells Mam she can sit on a bench in the station while he goes to see the IRA man in a place called Terenure. He says there are lavatories in the station for the boys, he won't be long, he'll have money when he returns and we'll all have food. He tells me go with him and Mam says, No, I need him to help. But when Dad says, I'll need help carrying all that money, she laughs and says, All right, go with your Pop. Your Pop. That means she's in a good mood. If she says your father it means she's in a bad mood. Dad holds my hand as I trot along beside him. He's a fast walker, it's a long way to Terenure and I'm hoping he'll stop and carry me the way he did with the twins in Toome. But he lopes along and says nothing except to ask people where Terenure is. In awhile he says we're in Terenure and now we have to find Mr. Charles Heggarty of the IRA. A man with a pink patch on his eye tells us we're on the right street, Charlie Heggarty lives at number fourteen, God blast him. The man tells Dad, I can see you're a man that did his bit. Dad says, Och, I did my bit, and the man says, I did me bit, too, and what did it get me but one eye less and a pension that wouldn't feed a canary. But Ireland is free, says Dad, and that's a grand thing. Free, my arse, the man says. I think we were better off under the English. Good luck to you anyway, mister, for I think I know what you're here for. A woman opens the door at number fourteen. I'm afraid, she says, that Mr. Heggarty is busy. Dad tells her he just walked all the way from the middle of Dublin with his small son, that he left wife and three children waiting for him at the bus place, and if Mr. Heggarty is that busy then we'll wait for him on the doorstep. The woman is back in a minute to say Mr. Heggarty has a little time to spare and would you come this way. Mr. Heggarty is sitting at a desk near a glowing fire. He says, What can I do for you? Dad stands before the desk and says, I have just returned from America with wife and four children. We have nothing. I fought with a Flying Column during the Troubles and I'm hoping you can help me now in the time of need. Mr. Heggarty takes Dad's name and turns the pages of a big book on his desk. He shakes his head, No, no record of your service here. Dad makes a long speech. He tells Mr. Heggarty how he fought, where, when, how he had to be smuggled out of Ireland because of the price on his head, how he was raising his sons to love Ireland. Mr. Heggarty says he's sorry but he can't be handing out money to every man who wanders in claiming he did his bit. Dad says to me, Remember this, Francis. This is the new Ireland. Little men in little chairs with little bits of paper. This is the Ireland men died for. Mr. Heggarty says he'll look into Dad's claim and he'll be sure to let him know what turns up. He'll let us have money to take the bus back into the city. Dad looks at the coins in Mr. Heggarty's hand and says, You could add to that and make the price of a pint. Oh, it's the drink you want, is it? One pint is hardly drink. You'd walk the miles back and make the boy walk because you want a pint, wouldn't you? Walking never killed anyone. I want you to leave this house, says Mr. Heggarty, or I'll call a guard, and you can be sure you'll never hear from me again. We're not handing out money to support the Guinness family. Night falls along the streets of Dublin. Children laugh and play under streetlights, mothers call from doorways, smells of cooking come at us all the way, through windows we see people around tables, eating. I'm tired and hungry and I want Dad to carry me but I know there's no use asking him now the way his face is tight and set. I let him hold my hand and I run to keep up with him till we reach the bus place where Mam is waiting with my brothers. They're all asleep on the bench, my mother and three brothers. When Dad tells Mam there's no money she shakes her head and sobs, Oh, Jesus, what are we going to do? A man in a blue uniform comes over and asks her, What's up, missus? Dad tells him we're stranded there at the bus station, we have no money and no place to stay and the children are hungry. The man says he's going off duty now, he'll take us to the police barracks where he has to report anyway, and they'll see what can be done. The man in uniform tells us we can call him guard. That's what you call policemen in Ireland. He asks us what you call policemen in America and Malachy says, cop. The guard pats him on the head and tells him he's a clever little Yankee. At the police barracks the sergeant tells us we can spend the night. He's sorry but all he can offer is the floor. It's Thursday and the cells are filled with men who drank their dole money and wouldn't leave the pubs. The guards give us hot sweet tea and thick slices of bread slathered with butter and jam and we're so happy we run around the barracks, playing. The guards say we're a great bunch of little Yanks and they'd like to take us home but I say, No, Malachy says, No, the twins say, No, No, and all the guards laugh. Men in cells reach out and pat our heads, they smell like Dad when he comes home singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley going to die. The men say, Jasus, will ye listen to them. They sound like bloody fillum stars. Did yez fall outa the sky or what? Women in cells at the other end tell Malachy he's gorgeous and the twins are dotes. One woman talks to me. C'mere, love, would you like a sweet? I nod, and she says, All right, put your hand out. She takes something sticky from her mouth and puts it on my hand. There you are now, she says, a nice bit of butterscotch. Put that in your mouth. I don't want to put it in my mouth because it's sticky and wet from her mouth but I don't know what you're supposed to do when a woman in a cell offers you sticky butterscotch and I'm about to put it in my mouth when a guard comes, takes the butterscotch and throws it back at the woman. You drunken hoor, he says, leave the child alone, and all the women laugh. The sergeant gives my mother a blanket and she sleeps stretched out on a bench. The rest of us lie on the floor. Dad sits with his back to the wall, his eyes open under the peak of his cap, and he smokes when the guards give him cigarettes. The guard who threw the butterscotch at the woman says he's from Ballymena in the north and he talks with Dad about people they know there and in other places like Cushendall and Toome. The guard says he'll have a pension some day and he'll live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away. Eels, he says, eels galore. Jasus, I love a fried eel. I ask Dad, Is this Cuchulain? and the guard laughs till his face turns red. Ah, Mother o' God, did yez hear this? The lad wants to know if I'm Cuchulain. A little Yank and he knows all about Cuchulain. Dad says, No, he's not Cuchulain but he's a fine man who will live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away. **** Dad is shaking me. Up, Francis, up. It is noisy in the barracks. A boy mopping the floor is singing, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this, Could it be true, someone like you Could love me, love me? I tell him that's my mother's song and he's to stop singing it but he just puffs on his cigarette and walks away and I wonder why people have to sing other people's songs. Men and women coming out of the cells are yawning and grunting. The woman who offered me the butterscotch stops and says, I had a drop taken, child. I'm sorry I made a fool of you, but the guard from Ballymena tells her, Move on, you oul' hoor, before I lock you up again. Oh, lock me up, she says. In, out. What does it matter, you blue arsed bastard. Mam is sitting up on the bench, the blanket wrapped around her. A woman with gray hair brings her a mug of tea and tells her, Sure, I'm the sergeant's wife and he said you might need help. Would you like a nice soft-boiled egg, missus? Mam shakes her head, no. Ah, now, missus, surely you should have a nice egg in your condition. But Mam shakes her head and I wonder how she can say no to a soft- boiled egg when there's nothing in the world like it. All right, ma'am, says the sergeant's wife, a bit of toast, then, and something for the children and your poor husband. She goes back to another room and soon there's tea and bread. Dad drinks his tea but gives us his bread and Mam says, Will you eat your bread, for God's sake. You won't be much use to us falling down with the hunger. He shakes his head and asks the sergeant's wife is there any chance of a cigarette. She brings him the cigarette and tells Mam the guards in the barracks have taken up a collection to pay our train fares to Limerick. There will be a motor car to pick up our trunk and leave us at Kingsbridge Railway Station and, You'll be in Limerick in three or four hours. Mam puts up her arms and hugs the sergeant's wife. God bless you and your husband and all the guards, Mam says. I don't know what we'd do without you. God knows 'tis a lovely thing to be back among our own. 'Tis the least we could do, says the sergeant's wife. These are lovely children you have and I'm from Cork meself and I know what 'tis to be in Dublin without two pennies to rub together. Dad sits at the other end of the bench, smoking his cigarette, drinking his tea. He stays that way till the motor car comes to take us through the streets of Dublin. Dad asks the driver if he'd mind going by way of the G. P. O. and the driver says, Is it a stamp you want or what? No, says Dad. I hear they put up a new statue of Cuchulain to honor the men who died in 1916 and I'd like to show it to my son here who has a great admiration for Cuchulain. The driver says he has no notion of who this Cuchulain was but he wouldn't mind stopping one bit. He might come in himself and see what the commotion is all about for he hasn't been in the G. P. O. since he was a boy and the English nearly wrecked it with their big guns firing up from the Liffey River. He says you'll see the bullet holes all over the front and they should be left there to remind the Irish of English perfidy. I ask the man what's perfidy and he says ask your father and I would but we're stopping outside a big building with columns and that's the G. P. O. Mam stays in the motor car while we follow the driver into the G. P. O. There he is, he says, there's your man Cuchulain. And I feel tears coming because I'm looking at him at last, Cuchulain, there on his pedestal in the G. P. O. He's golden and he has long hair, his head is hanging and there's a big bird perched on his shoulder. The driver says, Now what in God's name is this all about? What's this fellow doin' with the long hair and the bird on his shoulder? And will you kindly tell me, mister, what this has to do with the men of 1916? Dad says, Cuchulain fought to the end like the men of Easter Week. His enemies were afraid to go near him till they were sure he was dead and when the bird landed on him and drank his blood they knew. Well, says the driver, 'tis a sad day for the men of Ireland when they need a bird to tell them a man is dead. I think we better go now or we'll be missing that train to Limerick. The sergeant's wife said she'd send a telegram to Grandma to meet us in Limerick and there she was on the platform, Grandma, with white hair, sour eyes, a black shawl, and no smile for my mother or any of us, even my brother, Malachy, who had the big smile and the sweet white teeth. Mam pointed to Dad. This is Malachy, she said, and Grandma nodded and looked away. She called two boys who were hanging around the railway station and paid them to carry the trunk. The boys had shaved heads, snotty noses, and no shoes and we followed them through the streets of Limerick. I asked Mam why they had no hair and she said their heads were shaved so that the lice would have no place to hide. Malachy said, What's a lice? and Mam said, Not lice. One of them is a louse. Grandma said, Will ye stop it! What kind o' talk is this? The boys whistled and laughed and trotted along as if they had shoes and Grandma told them, Stop that laughin' or 'tis droppin' an' breakin' that trunk ye'll be. They stopped the whistling and laughing and we followed them into a park with a tall pillar and a statue in the middle and grass so green it dazzled you. Dad carried the twins, Mam carried a bag in one hand and held Malachy's hand with the other. When she stopped every few minutes to catch her breath, Grandma said, Are you still smokin' them fags? Them fags will be the death of you. There's enough consumption in Limerick without people smokin' fags on top of it an' 'tis a rich man's foolishness. Along the path through the park there were hundreds of flowers of different colors that excited the twins. They pointed and made squeaky noises and we laughed, everyone except Grandma, who pulled her shawl over her head. Dad stopped and put the twins down so that they could be closer to the flowers. He said, Flowers, and they ran back and forth, pointing, trying to say Flowers. One of the boys with the trunk said, God, are they Americans? and Mam said, They are. They were born in New York. All the boys were born in New York. The boy said to the other boy, God, they're Americans. They put the trunk down and stared at us and we stared back at them till Grandma said, Are ye goin' to stand here all day lookin' at flowers an' gawkin' at each other? And we all moved on again, out of the park, down a narrow lane and into another lane to Grandma's house. There is a row of small houses on each side of the lane and Grandma lives in one of the small houses. Her kitchen has a shiny polished black iron range with a fire glowing in the grate. There is a table along the wall under the window and a press opposite with cups and saucers and vases. This press is always locked and she keeps the key in her purse because you're not supposed to use anything in there unless someone dies or returns from foreign parts or there's a visit by a priest. There is a picture on the wall by the range of a man with long brown hair and sad eyes. He is pointing to his chest where there is a big heart with flames coming out of it. Mam tells us, That's the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and I want to know why the man's heart is on fire and why doesn't He throw water on it? Grandma says, Don't these children know anything about their religion? and Mam tells her it's different in America. Grandma says the Sacred Heart is everywhere and there's no excuse for that kind of ignorance. Under the picture of the man with the burning heart there is a shelf with a red glass holding a flickering candle and next to it a small statue. Mam tells us, That's the Baby Jesus, the Infant of Prague, and if ye ever need anything pray to Him. Malachy says, Mam, could I tell Him I'm hungry, and Mam puts her finger to her lips. Grandma grumbles around the kitchen making tea and telling Mam to cut the loaf of bread and don't make the cuts too thick. Mam sits by the table with her breath coming hard and says she'll cut the bread in a minute. Dad takes the knife and starts slicing the bread and you can see Grandma doesn't like that. She frowns at him but says nothing even though he makes thick slices. There aren't enough chairs for everyone so I sit on the stairs with my brothers to have bread and tea. Dad and Mam sit at the table and Grandma sits under the Sacred Heart with her mug of tea. She says, I don't know under God what I'm goin' to do with ye. There is no room in this house. There isn't room for even one of ye. Malachy says, Ye, ye, and starts to giggle and I say, Ye, ye, and the twins say, Ye, ye, and we're laughing so hard we can hardly eat our bread. Grandma glares at us. What are ye laughin' at? There's nothin' to laugh at in this house. Ye better behave yeerselves before I go over to ye. She won't stop saying Ye, and now Malachy is helpless with laughter, spewing out his bread and tea, his face turning red. Dad says, Malachy and the rest of you, stop it. But Malachy can't, he goes on laughing till Dad says, Come over here. He rolls up Malachy's sleeve and raises his hand to slap his arm. Are you going to behave yourself? Malachy's eyes fill with tears and he nods, I will, because Dad never raised his hand like that before. Dad says, Be a good boy and go sit with your brothers, and he pulls down the sleeve and pats Malachy on the head. That night Mam's sister, Aunt Aggie, came home from her job in the clothing factory. She was big like the MacNamara sisters, and she had flaming red hair. She wheeled a large bicycle into the little room behind the kitchen and came out to her supper. She was living in Grandma's because she had a fight with her husband, Pa Keating, who told her, when he had drink taken, You're a great fat cow, go home to your mother. That's what Grandma told Mam and that's why there was no room for us in Grandma's house. She had herself, Aunt Aggie, and her son Pat, who was my uncle and who was out selling newspapers. Aunt Aggie complained when Grandma told her Mam would have to sleep with her that night. Grandma said, Oh, will you shut your gob. 'Tis only for one night an' that won't kill you an' if you don't like it you can go back to your husband where you belong anyway instead of runnin' home to me. Jesus, Mary an' Holy St. Joseph, look at this house- you an' Pat an' Angela and her clatther of Americans. Will I have any peace in the latter end of my life? She spread coats and rags on the floor of the little back room and we slept there with the bicycle. Dad stayed on a chair in the kitchen, took us to the lavatory in the backyard when we needed it, and in the night hushed the twins when they cried from the cold. In the morning, Aunt Aggie came for her bicycle telling us, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of my way? When she left, Malachy kept saying, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of the way, will ye? and I could hear Dad laughing out in the kitchen till Grandma came down the stairs and he had to tell Malachy be quiet. That day Grandma and Mam went out and found a furnished room on Windmill Street where Aunt Aggie had a flat with her husband, Pa Keating. Grandma paid the rent, ten shillings for two weeks. She gave Mam money for food, loaned us a kettle, a pot, a frying pan, knives and spoons, jam jars to be used for mugs, a blanket and a pillow. She said that was all she could afford anymore, that Dad would have to get up off his arse, get a job, go on the dole, go for the charity at the St. Vincent de Paul Society or go on the relief. The room had a fireplace where we could boil water for our tea or an egg in case we ever came into money. We had a table and three chairs and a bed, which Mam said was the biggest she had ever seen. We were glad of the bed that night, worn out after nights on floors in Dublin and in Grandma's. It didn't matter that there were six of us in the bed, we were together, away from grandmothers and guards, Malachy could say ye ye ye and we could laugh as much as we liked. Dad and Mam lay at the head of the bed, Malachy and I at the bottom, the twins wherever they could find comfort. Malachy made us laugh again. Ye, ye, ye, he said, and oy oy oy, and then fell asleep. Mam made the little hink hink snore sound that told us she was sleeping. In the moonlight I could look up the length of the bed and see Dad still awake and when Oliver cried in his sleep Dad reached for him and held him. Whisht, he said. Whisht. Then Eugene sat up, screaming, tearing at himself. Ah, ah, Mommy, Mommy. Dad sat up. What? What's up, son? Eugene went on crying and when Dad leaped from the bed and turned on the gaslight we saw the fleas, leaping, jumping, fastened to our flesh. We slapped at them and slapped but they hopped from body to body, hopping, biting. We tore at the bites till they bled. We jumped from the bed, the twins crying, Mam moaning, Oh, Jesus, will we have no rest! Dad poured water and salt into a jam jar and dabbed at our bites. The salt burned but he said we'd feel better soon. Mam sat by the fireplace with the twins on her lap. Dad pulled on his trousers and dragged the mattress off the bed and out to the street. He filled the kettle and the pot with water, stood the mattress against the wall, pounded it with a shoe, told me to keep pouring water on the ground to drown the fleas dropping there. The Limerick moon was so bright I could see bits of it shimmering in the water and I wanted to scoop up moon bits but how could I with the fleas leaping on my legs. Dad kept pounding with the shoe and I had to run back through the house to the backyard tap for more water in the kettle and the pot. Mam said, Look at you. Your shoes are drenched and you'll catch your death and your father will surely get the pneumonia without a shoe to his foot. A man on a bicycle stopped and wanted to know why Dad was beating that mattress. Mother o' God, he said, I never heard such a cure for fleas. Do you know that if a man could jump like a flea one lep would take him halfway to the moon? The thing to do is this, when you go back inside with that mattress stick it on the bed upside down and that will confuse the little buggers. They won't know where they are and they'll be biting the mattress or each other, which is the best cure of all. After they bite the human being they have the frenzy, you know, for there are other fleas around them that also bit the human being and the smell of the blood is too much for them and they go out of their minds. They're a right bloody torment an' I should know for didn't I grow up in Limerick, down in the Irishtown, an' the fleas there were so plentiful an' forward they'd sit on the toe of your boot an' discuss Ireland's woeful history with you. It is said there were no fleas in ancient Ireland, that they were brought in be the English to drive us out of our wits entirely, an'I wouldn't put it past the English. An'isn't it a very curious thing that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland an' the English brought in the fleas. For centuries Ireland was a lovely peaceful place, snakes gone, not a flea to be found. You could stroll the four green fields of Ireland without fear of snakes an' have a good night's sleep with no fleas to bother you. Them snakes were doin' no harm, they wouldn't bother you unless you cornered them an' they lived off other creatures that move under bushes an'such places, whereas the flea sucks the blood from you mornin' noon an' night for that's his nature an' he can't help himself. I hear for a fact that places that have snakes galore have no fleas. Arizona, for instance. You're forever hearing about the snakes of Arizona but when did you ever hear of fleas in Arizona? Good luck to you. I have to be careful standin' here for if one of them gets on my clothes I might as well invite his whole family home. They multiply faster than Hindus. Dad said, You wouldn't by any chance have a cigarette, would you? A cigarette? Oh, sure, of course. Here you are. Aren't I nearly destroyed from the fags myself. The oul' hacking cough, you know. So powerful it nearly knocks me off the bicycle. I can feel that cough stirring in me solar plexus an' workin' its way up through me entrails till the next thing it takes off the top o' me head. He struck a match on a box, lit a cigarette for himself and held out the match for Dad. Of course, he said, you're bound to have the cough when you live in Limerick because this is the capital city of the weak chest and the weak chest leads to the consumption. If all the people that has consumption in Limerick were to die this would be a ghost town, though I don't have consumption meself. No, this cough was a present from the Germans. He paused, puffed on his cigarette, and struggled with a cough. Bejesus, excuse the language, but the fags'll get me in the end. Well, I'll leave you now to the mattress an' remember what I told you, confuse the little buggers. He wobbled away on his bicycle, the cigarette dangling from his mouth, the cough racking his body. Dad said, Limerickmen talk too much. Come on, we'll put this mattress back and see if there's any sleep in this night. Mam sat by the fireplace with the twins asleep on her lap, and Malachy lay curled up on the floor by her feet. She said, Who was that you were talking to? It sounded very like Pa Keating, Aggie's husband. I could tell by the cough. He got that cough in France in the war when he swallowed the gas. We slept the rest of that night, and in the morning we saw where the fleas had feasted, our flesh pink with flea welts and bright with the blood of our scratches. Mam made tea and fried bread, and once more Dad dabbed at our bites with the salty water. He hauled the mattress outside again to the backyard. On a cold day like this the fleas would surely freeze to death and we'd all have a good night's sleep. A few days later when we're settled into the room Dad is shaking me out of my dreams. Up, Francis, up. Put on your clothes and run over for your aunt Aggie. Your mother needs her. Hurry. Mam is moaning in the bed, her face pure white. Dad has Malachy and the twins out of the bed and sitting on the floor by the dead fire. I run across the street and knock on Aunt Aggie's door till Uncle Pat Keating comes coughing and grumbling, What's up? What's up? My mother is moaning in the bed. I think she's sick. Now Aunt Aggie comes grumbling. Ye are nothing but trouble since ye came from America. Leave him alone, Aggie, he's only a child that's doing what he's told. She tells Uncle Pa go back to bed, that he has to go to work in the morning not like some from the North that she won't mention. He says, No, no, I'm coming. There's something wrong with Angela. Dad tells me sit over there with my brothers. I don't know what's up with Mam because everyone is whispering and I can barely hear Aunt Aggie Pa is about never looks at him. telling Uncle Pa the child is lost run for the ambulance and Uncle out the door, Aunt Aggie telling Mam you can say what you like Limerick but the ambulance is fast. She doesn't talk to my father, Malachy says, Dad, is Mammy sick? Och, she'll be all right, son. She has to see the doctor. I wonder what child is lost because we're all here, one two three four of us, not a lost child anywhere and why can't they tell me what's wrong with my mother. Uncle Pa comes back and the ambulance is right behind him. A man comes in with a stretcher and after they carry Mam away there are blood spots on the floor by the bed. Malachy bit his tongue and there was blood and the dog on the street had blood and he died. I want to ask Dad to tell me if Mam will be gone forever like my sister Margaret but he's going with Mam and there's no use asking Aunt Aggie anything for fear she'd bite your head off. She wipes away the blood spots and tells us get back into bed and stay there till Dad comes home. It's the middle of the night and the four of us are warm in the bed and we fall asleep till Dad comes home and tells us Mam is nice and comfortable in the hospital and she'll be home in no time. Later, Dad goes to the Labour Exchange for the dole. There is no hope of a laboring man with a North of Ireland accent getting a job in Limerick. When he returns, he tells Mam we'll be getting nineteen shillings a week. She says that's just enough for all of us to starve on. Nineteen shillings for six of us? That's less than four dollars in American money and how are we supposed to live on that? What are we to do when we have to pay rent in a fortnight? If the rent for this room is five shillings a week we'll have fourteen shillings for food and clothes and coal to boil the water for the tea. Dad shakes his head, sips his tea from a jam jar, stares out the window and whistles ""The Boys of Wexford. "" Malachy and Oliver clap their hands and dance around the room and Dad doesn't know whether to whistle or smile because you can't do both and he can't help himself. He has to stop and smile and pat Oliver's head and then go back to the whistling. Mam smiles, too, but it's a very quick smile and when she looks into the ashes you can see the worry where the corners of her mouth turn down. Next day she tells Dad to mind the twins and takes Malachy and me with her to the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We stand in a queue with women wearing black shawls. They ask our names and smile when we talk. They say, Lord above, would you listen to the little Yankees, and they wonder why Mam in her American coat would be looking for charity since there's hardly enough for the poor people of Limerick without Yanks coming over and taking the bread out of their mouths. Mam tells them a cousin gave her that coat in Brooklyn, that her husband has no work, that she has other children at home, twin boys. The women sniff and pull their shawls about them, they have their own troubles. Mam tells them she had to leave America because she couldn't stand it after her baby girl died. The women sniff again but now it's because Mam is crying. Some say they lost little ones, too, and there's nothing worse in the world, you could live as long as Methuselem's wife but you never get over it. No man can ever know what it is to be a mother that has lost a child, not if the man lived longer than two Methuselems. They all have a good cry till a red-haired woman passes a little box around. The women pick something from the box between their fingers and stuff it up their noses. A young woman sneezes and the red-haired woman laughs. Ah, sure, Biddy, you're not able for that snuff. Come here, little Yankee boys, have a pinch. She plants the brown stuff in our nostrils and we sneeze so hard the women stop crying and laugh till they have to wipe their eyes with their shawls. Mam tells us, That's good for ye, 'twill clear yeer heads. The young woman, Biddy, tells Mam we're two lovely boys. She points at Malachy. That little fella with the goldy ringlet, isn't he gorgeous? He could be a film star with Shirley Temple. And Malachy smiles and warms up the queue. The woman with the snuff says to Mam, Missus, I don't want to be forward but I think you should be sitting down for we heard about your loss. Another woman worries, Ah, no, they don't like that. Who don't like what? Ah, sure, Nora Molloy, the Society don't like us sittin' on the steps. They want us to be standin' respectful against the wall. They can kiss my arse, says Nora, the red-haired woman. Sit down there, missus, on that step an' I'll sit next to you an' if there's one word out of the St. Vincent de Paul Society I'll take the face off 'em, so I will. Do you smoke, missus? I do, says Mam, but I don't have them. Nora takes a cigarette from a pocket in her apron, breaks it, and offers half to Mam. The worried woman says, They don't like that either. They say every fag you smoke is taking food from the mouth of your child. Mr. Quinlivan inside is dead against it. He says if you have money for the fags you have money for food. Quinlivan can kiss my arse, too, the grinny oul' bastard. Is he going to begrudge us a puff of a fag, the only comfort we have in the world? A door opens at the end of the hall and a man appears. Are any of ye waiting for children's boots? Women raise their hands, I am. I am. Well, the boots are all gone. Ye'll have to come back next month. But my Mikey needs boots for school. They're all gone, I told you. But 'tis freezin' abroad, Mr. Quinlivan. The boots are all gone. Nothing I can do. What's this? Who's smoking? Nora waves her cigarette. I am, she says, and enjoying it down to the last ash. Every puff you take, he starts. I know, she says, I'm taking food out of the mouths of my children. You're insolent, woman. You'll get no charity here. Is that a fact? Well, Mr. Quinlivan, if I don't get it here I know where I will. What are you talking about? I'll go to the Quakers. They'll give me the charity. Mr. Quinlivan steps toward Nora and points a finger. Do you know what we have here? We have a souper in our midst. We had the soupers in the Famine. The Protestants went round telling good Catholics that if they gave up their faith and turned Protestant they'd get more soup than their bellies could hold and, God help us, some Catholics took the soup, and were ever after known as soupers and lost their immortal souls doomed to the deepest part of hell. And you, woman, if you go to the Quakers you'll lose your immortal soul and the souls of your children. other Then, Mr. Quinlivan, you'll have to save us, won't you? He stares at her and she stares back at him. His eyes wander to the women. One puts her hand to her mouth to smother a laugh. What are you tittering about? he barks. Oh, nothing, Mr. Quinlivan. Honest to God. I'm telling ye once more, no boots. And he slams the door behind him. One by one the women are called into the room. When Nora comes out she's smiling and waving a piece of paper. Boots, she says. Three pairs I'm gettin' for my children. Threaten the men in there with the Quakers and they'll give you the drawers off their arses. When Mam is called she brings Malachy and me in with her. We stand before a table where three men are sitting asking questions. Mr. Quinlivan starts to say something but the man in the middle says, Enough out of you, Quinlivan. If we left it up to you we'd have the poor people of Limerick jumping into the arms of the Protestants. He turns to Mam, he wants to know where she got that fine red coat. She tells him what she told the women outside and when she comes to the death of Margaret she shakes and sobs. She tells the men she's very sorry for crying like that but it was only a few months ago and she's not over it yet, not even knowing where her baby was buried if she was buried at all, not knowing even if she was baptized itself because she was so weak from having the four boys she didn't have the energy to be going to the church for the baptism and it's a heart scald to think Margaret might be in Limbo forever with no hope of her ever seeing the rest of us whether we're in heaven, hell, or Purgatory itself. Mr. Quinlivan brings her his chair. Ah, now, missus. Ah, now. Sit down, will you. Ah, now. The other men look at the table, the ceiling. The man in the middle says he's giving Mam a docket to get a week's groceries at McGrath's shop on Parnell Street. There will be tea, sugar, flour, milk, butter and a separate docket for a bag of coal from Sutton's coal yard on the Dock Road. The third man says, Of course you won't be getting this every week, missus. We will be visiting your house to see if there's a real need. We have to do that, missus, so we can review your claim. Mam wipes her face on the back of her sleeve and takes the docket. She tells the men, God bless you for your kindness. They nod and look at the table, the ceiling, the walls and tell her send in the next woman. The women outside tell Mam, When you go to McGrath's, keep an eye on the oul' bitch for she'll cheat you on the weight. She'll put stuff on a paper on the scale with the paper hanging down on her side behind the counter where she thinks you can't see it. She'll pull on that paper so that you're lucky if you get half of what you're supposed to get. And she has pictures of the Virgin Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus all over the shop, and she's forever on her knees abroad in St. Joseph's chapel clackin' her rosary beads an' breathing like a virgin martyr, the oul' bitch. Nora says, I'll go with you, missus. I'm on to the same Mrs. McGrath and I'll know if she's cheating you. She leads the way to the shop in Parnell Street. The woman behind the counter is pleasant to Mam in her American coat till Mam shows the St. Vincent de Paul docket. The woman says, I don't know what you're doing here at this hour of the day. I never serve the charity cases before six in the evening. But this is your first time and I'll make an exception. She says to Nora, Do you have a docket, too? No. I'm a friend helping this poor family with their first docket from the St. Vincent de Paul. The woman lays a sheet of newspaper on the scale and pours on flour from a large bag. When she finishes pouring, she says, There's a pound of flour. I don't think so, says Nora. That's a very small pound of flour. The woman flushes and glares, Are you accusin' me? Ah, no, Mrs. McGrath, says Nora. I think there was a little accident there the way your hip was pressed against that paper and you didn't even know the paper was pulled down a bit. Oh, God, no. A woman like you that's forever on her knees before the Virgin Mary is an inspiration to us all and is that your money I see on the floor there? Mrs. McGrath steps back quickly and the needle on the scale jumps and quivers. What money? she says, till she looks at Nora, and knows. Nora smiles. Must be a trick of the shadows, she says, and smiles at the scale. There was a mistake right enough for that shows barely half a pound of flour. That scale gives me more trouble, says Mrs. McGrath. I'm sure it does, says Nora. But my conscience is clear before God, says Mrs. McGrath. I'm sure it is, says Nora, and you're admired by one and all at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Legion of Mary. I try to be a good Catholic. Try? God knows 'tis little trying you'd have for you're well known for having a kind heart and I was wondering if you could spare a couple of sweets for the little boys here. Well, now, I'm not a millionaire, but here... God bless you, Mrs. McGrath, and I know it's asking a lot but could you possibly lend me a couple of cigarettes? Well, now, they're not on the docket. I'm not here to supply luxuries. If you could see your way, missus, I'd be sure to mention your kindness to the St. Vincent de Paul. All right, all right, says Mrs. McGrath. Here. One time for the cigarettes and one time only. God bless you, says Nora, and I'm sorry you had so much trouble with that scale. On the way home we stopped in the People's Park and sat on a bench while Malachy and I sucked on our sweets and Mam and Nora smoked their cigarettes. The smoking brought on Nora's cough and she told Mam the fags would kill her in the end, that there was a touch of consumption in her family and no one lived to a ripe old age, though who would want to in Limerick, a place where you could look around and the first thing you noticed was a scarcity of gray hairs, all the gray hairs either in the graveyard or across the Atlantic working on railroads or sauntering around in police uniforms. You're lucky, missus, that you saw a bit of the world. Oh, God, I'd give anything to see New York, people dancing up and down Broadway without a care. No, I had to go and fall for a boozer with the charm, Peter Molloy, a champion pint drinker that had me up the pole and up the aisle when I was barely seventeen. I was ignorant, missus. We grew up ignorant in Limerick, so we did, knowing feck all about anything and signs on, we're mothers before we're women. And there's nothing here but rain and oul' biddies saying the rosary. I'd give me teeth to get out, go to America or even England itself. The champion pint drinker is always on the dole and sometimes he even drinks that and drives me so demented I wind up in the lunatic asylum. She drew on her cigarette and gagged, coughing till her body rocked back and forth, and in between the coughs she whimpered, Jesus, Jesus. When the cough died away she said she had to go home and take her medicine. She said, I'll see you next week, missus, at the St. Vincent de Paul. If you're stuck for anything send a message to me at Vize's Field. Ask anyone for the wife of Peter Molloy, champion pint drinker. Eugene is sleeping under a coat on the bed. Dad sits by the fireplace with Oliver on his lap. I wonder why Dad is telling Oliver a Cuchulain story. He knows the Cuchulain stories are mine, but when I look at Oliver I don't mind. His cheeks are bright red, he's staring into the dead fire, and you can see he has no interest in Cuchulain. Mam puts her hand on his forehead. I think he has a fever, she says. I wish I had an onion and I'd boil it in milk and pepper. That's good for the fever. But even if I had what would I boil the milk on? We need coal for that fire. She gives Dad the docket for the coal down the Dock Road. He takes me with him but it's dark and all the coal yards are closed. What are we going to do now, Dad? I don't know, son. Ahead of us women in shawls and small children are picking up coal along the road. There, Dad, there's coal. Och, no, son. We won't pick coal off the road. We're not beggars. He tells Mam the coal yards are closed and we'll have to drink milk and eat bread tonight, but when I tell her about the women on the road she passes Eugene to him. If you're too grand to pick coal off the road I'll put on my coat and go down the Dock Road. She gets a bag and takes Malachy and me with her. Beyond the Dock Road there is something wide and dark with lights glinting in it. Mam says that's the River Shannon. She says that's what she missed most of all in America, the River Shannon. The Hudson was lovely but the Shannon sings. I can't hear the song but my mother does and that makes her happy. The other women are gone from the Dock Road and we search for the bits of coal that drop from lorries. Mam tells us gather anything that burns, coal, wood, cardboard, paper. She says, There are them that burn the horse droppings but we're not gone that low yet. When her bag is nearly full she says, Now we have to find an onion for Oliver. Malachy says he'll find one but she tells him, No, you don't find onions on the road, you get them in shops. The minute he sees a shop he cries out, There's a shop, and runs in. Oonyen, he says. Oonyen for Oliver. Mam runs into the shop and tells the women behind the counter, I'm sorry. The woman says, Lord, he's a dote. Is he an American or what? Mam says he is. The woman smiles and shows two teeth, one on each side of her upper gum. A dote, she says, and look at them gorgeous goldy curls. And what is it he wants now? A sweet? Ah, no, says Mam. An onion. The woman laughs, An onion? I never heard a child wanting an onion before. Is that what they like in America? Mam says, I just mentioned I wanted to get an onion for my other child that's sick. Boil the onion in milk, you know. True for you, missus. You can't beat the onion boiled in milk. And look, little boy, here's a sweet for yourself and one for the other little boy, the brother, I suppose. Mam says, Ah, sure, you shouldn't. Say thank you, boys. The woman says, Here's a nice onion for the sick child, missus. Mam says, Oh, I can't buy the onion now, missus. I don't have a penny on me. I'm giving you the onion, missus. Let it never be said a child went sick in Limerick for want of an onion. And don't forget to sprinkle in a little pepper. Do you have pepper, missus? Ah, no, I don't but I should be getting it any day now. Well, here, missus. Pepper and a little salt. Do the child all the good in the world. Mam says, God bless you, ma'am, and her eyes are watery. Dad is walking back and forth with Oliver in his arms and Eugene is playing on the floor with a pot and a spoon. Dad says, Did you get the onion? I did, says Mam, and more. I got coal and the way of lighting it. I knew you would. I said a prayer to St. Jude. He's my favorite saint, patron of desperate cases. I got the coal. I got the onion, no help from St. Jude. Dad says, You shouldn't be picking up coal off the road like a common beggar. It isn't right. Bad example for the boys. Then you should have sent St. Jude down the Dock Road. Malachy says, I'm hungry, and I'm hungry, too, but Mam says, Ye'll wait till Oliver has his onion boiled in milk. She gets the fire going, cuts the onion in half, drops it in the boiling milk with a little butter and sprinkles the milk with pepper. She takes Oliver on her lap and tries to feed him but he turns away and looks into the fire. Ah, come on, love, she says. Good for you. Make you big and strong. He tightens his mouth against the spoon. She puts the pot down, rocks him till he's asleep, lays him on the bed and tells the rest of us be quiet or she'll demolish us. She slices the other half of the onion and fries it in butter with slices of bread. She lets us sit on the floor around the fire where we eat the fried bread and sip at the scalding sweet tea in jam jars. She says, That fire is good and bright so we can turn off that gaslight till we get money for the meter. The fire makes the room warm and with the flames dancing in the coal you can see faces and mountains and valleys and animals leaping. Eugene falls asleep on the floor and Dad lifts him to the bed beside Oliver. Mam puts the boiled onion pot up on the mantelpiece for fear a mouse or rat might be at it. She says she's tired out from the day, the Vincent de Paul Society, Mrs. McGrath's shop, the search for coal down the Dock Road, the worry over Oliver not wanting the boiled onion, and if he's like this tomorrow she's taking him to the doctor, and now she's going to bed. Soon we're all in bed and if there's the odd flea I don't mind because it's warm in the bed with the six of us and I love the glow of the fire the way it dances on the walls and ceiling and makes the room go red and black, red and black, till it dims to white and black and all you can hear is a little cry from Oliver turning in my mother's arms. In the morning Dad is lighting the fire, making tea, cutting the bread. He's already dressed and he's telling Mam hurry up and get dressed. He says to me, Francis, your little brother Oliver is sick and we're taking him to the hospital. You are to be a good boy and take care of your two brothers. We'll be back soon. Mam says, When we're out go easy with that sugar. We're not millionaires. When Mam picks up Oliver and wraps him in a coat Eugene stands on the bed. I want Ollie, he says. Ollie play. Ollie will be back soon, she says, and you can play with him. Now you can play with Malachy and Frank. Ollie, Ollie, I want Ollie. He follows Oliver with his eyes and when they're gone he sits on the bed looking out the window. Malachy says, Genie, Genie, we have bread, we have tea. Sugar on your bread, Genie. He shakes his head and pushes away the bread Malachy is offering. He crawls to the place where Oliver slept with Mam, puts his head down and stares out the window. Grandma is at the door. I heard your father and mother were running down Henry Street with the child in their arms. Now where are they gone to? Oliver is sick, I said. He wouldn't eat the boiled onion in milk. What are you blatherin' about? Wouldn't eat the boiled onion and got sick. And who's minding ye? I am. And what's up with the child in the bed? What's That's Eugene. He misses Oliver. They're twins. I know they're twins. That child looks starved. his name? Have ye any porridge here? What's porridge? says Malachy. Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! What's porridge! Porridge is porridge. That's what porridge is. Ye are the most ignorant bunch o' Yanks I ever seen. Come on, put on yeer clothes and we'll go across the street to your aunt Aggie. She's there with the husband, Pa Keating, and she'll give ye some porridge. She picks up Eugene, wraps him in her shawl and we cross the street to Aunt Aggie's. She's living with Uncle Pa again because he said she wasn't a fat cow after all. Do you have any porridge? Grandma says to Aunt Aggie. Porridge? Am I supposed to be feeding porridge to a crowd of Yanks? Pity about you, says Grandma. It won't kill you to give them a little porridge. And I suppose they'll be wanting sugar and milk on top of everything or they might be banging on my door looking for an egg if you don't mind. I don't know why we have to pay for Angela's mistakes. Jesus, says Grandma, 'tis a good thing you didn't own that stable in Bethlehem or the Holy Family would still be wanderin' the world crumblin' with the hunger. Grandma pushes her way past Aunt Aggie, puts Eugene on a chair near the fire and makes the porridge. A man comes in from another room. He has black curly hair and his skin is black and I like his eyes because they're very blue and ready to smile. He's Aunt Aggie's husband, the man who stopped the night we were attacking the fleas and told us all about fleas and snakes, the man with the cough he got from swallowing gas in the war. Malachy says, Why are you all black? and Uncle Pa Keating laughs and coughs so hard he has to ease himself with a cigarette. Oh, the little Yanks, he says. They're not a bit shy. I'm black because I work at the Limerick Gas Works shoveling coal and coke into the furnaces. Gassed in France and back to Limerick to work in the gas works. When you grow up you'll laugh. Malachy and I have to leave the table so the big people can sit and have tea. They have their tea but Uncle Pa Keating, who is my uncle because he's married to my aunt Aggie, picks up Eugene and takes him on his lap. He says, This is a sad little fella, and makes funny faces and silly sounds. Malachy and I laugh but Eugene only reaches up to touch the blackness of Pa Keating's skin, and then when Pa pretends to bite his little hand, Eugene laughs and everyone in the room laughs. Malachy goes to Eugene and tries to make him laugh even more but Eugene turns away and hides his face in Pa Keating's shirt. I think he likes me, says Pa, and that's when Aunt Aggie puts down her teacup and starts to bawl, Waah, waah, waah, big teardrops tumbling down her fat red face. Aw, Jesus, says Grandma, there she is again. What's up with you this time? And Aunt Aggie blubbers, To see Pa there with a child on his lap an' me with no hope of having my own. Grandma barks at her, Stop talkin' like that in front of the children. Have you no shame? When God is good and ready He'll send you your family. Aunt Aggie sobs, Angela with five born an' one just gone an' her so useless she couldn't scrub a floor an' me with none an' I can scrub an' clean with the best and make any class of a stew or a fry. Pa Keating laughs, I think I'll keep this little fella. Malachy runs to him. No, no, no. That's my brother, that's Eugene. And I say, No, no, no, that's our brother. Aunt Aggie pats the tears on her cheeks. She says, I don't want nothing of Angela's. I don't want nothing that's half Limerick and half North of Ireland, so I don't, so ye can take him home. I'll have me own someday if I have to do a hundred novenas to the Virgin Mary and her mother, St. Ann, or if I have to crawl from here to Lourdes on me two bended knees. Grandma says, That's enough. Ye have had yeer porridge and 'tis time to go home and see if yeer father and mother are back from the hospital. She puts on her shawl and goes to pick up Eugene but he clutches so hard at Pa Keating's shirt she has to pull him away though he keeps looking back at Pa till we're out the door. *** We followed Grandma back to our room. She put Eugene in the bed and gave him a drink of water. She told him to be a good boy and go to sleep for his little brother, Oliver, would be home soon and they'd be playing again there on the floor. But he kept looking out the window. She told Malachy and me we could sit on the floor and play but to be quiet because she was going to say her prayers. Malachy went to the bed and sat by Eugene and I sat on a chair at the table making out words on the newspaper that was our tablecloth. All you could hear in the room was Malachy whispering to make Eugene happy and Grandma mumbling to the click of her rosary beads. It was so quiet I put my head on the table and fell asleep. Dad is touching my shoulder. Come on, Francis, you have to take care of your little brothers. Mam is slumped on the edge of the bed, making small crying sounds like a bird. Grandma is pulling on her shawl. She says, I'll go down to Thompson the undertaker about the coffin and the carriage. The St. Vincent de Paul Society will surely pay for that, God knows. She goes out the door. Dad stands facing the wall over the fire, beating on his thighs with his fists, sighing, Och, och, och. Dad frightens me with his och, och, och, and Mam frightens me with her small bird sounds and I don't know what to do though I wonder if anyone will light the fire in the grate so that we can have tea and bread because it's a long time since we had the porridge. If Dad would move away from the fireplace I could light the fire myself. All you need is paper, a few bits of coal or turf, and a match. He won't move so I try to go around his legs while he's beating on his thighs but he notices me and wants to know why I'm trying to light the fire. I tell him we're all hungry and he lets out a crazy laugh. Hungry? he says. Och, Francis, your wee brother Oliver is dead. Your wee sister is dead and your wee brother is dead. He picks me up and hugs me so hard I cry out. Then Malachy cries, my mother cries, Dad cries, I cry, but Eugene stays quiet. Then Dad sniffles, We'll have a feast. Come on, Francis. He tells my mother we'll be back in awhile but she has Malachy and Eugene on her lap in the bed and she doesn't look up. He carries me through the streets of Limerick and we go from shop to shop with him asking for food or anything they can give to a family that has two children dead in a year, one in America, one in Limerick, and in danger of losing three more for the want of food and drink. Most shopkeepers shake their heads. Sorry for your troubles but you could go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or get the public assistance. Dad says he's glad to see the spirit of Christ alive in Limerick and they tell him they don't need the likes of him with his northern accent to be telling them about Christ and he should be ashamed of himself dragging a child around like that like a common beggar, a tinker, a knacker. A few shopkeepers give bread, potatoes, tins of beans and Dad says, We'll go home now and you boys can eat something, but we meet Uncle Pa Keating and he tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and would Dad like to have a pint in this pub here? There are men sitting in this pub with great glasses of black stuff before them. Uncle Pa Keating and Dad have the black stuff, too. They lift their glasses carefully and slowly drink. There is creamy white stuff on their lips, which they lick with little sighs. Uncle Pa gets me a bottle of lemonade and Dad gives me a piece of bread and I don't feel hungry anymore. Still, I wonder how long we'll sit here with Malachy and Eugene hungry at home, hours from the porridge, which Eugene didn't eat anyway. Dad and Uncle Pa drink their glass of black stuff and have another. Uncle Pa says, Frankie, this is the pint. This is the staff of life. This is the best thing for nursing mothers and for those who are long weaned. He laughs and Dad smiles and I laugh because I think that's what you're supposed to do when Uncle Pa says something. He doesn't laugh when he tells the other men about Oliver dying. The other men tip their hats to Dad. Sorry for your troubles, mister, and surely you'll have a pint. Dad says yes to the pints and soon he's singing Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry and song after song I never heard before and crying over his lovely little girl, Margaret, that died in America and his little boy, Oliver, dead beyond in the City Home Hospital. It frightens me the way he yells and cries and sings and I wish I could be at home with my three brothers, no, my two brothers, and my mother. The man behind the bar says to Dad, I think now, mister, you've had enough. We're sorry for your troubles but you have to take that child home to his mother that must be heartbroken by the fire. Dad says, One, one more pint, just one, eh? and the man says no. Dad shakes his fist. I did me bit for Ireland, and when the man comes out and takes Dad's arm, Dad tries to push him away. Uncle Pa says, Come on now, Malachy, stop the blaguarding. You have to go home to Angela. You have a funeral tomorrow and the lovely children waiting for you. But Dad struggles till a few men push him out into the darkness. Uncle Pa stumbles out with the bag of food. Come on, he says. We'll go back to your room. Dad wants to go to another place for a pint but Uncle Pa says he has no more money. Dad says he'll tell everyone his sorrows and they'll give him pints. Uncle Pa says that's a disgraceful thing to do and Dad cries on his shoulder. You're a good friend, he tells Uncle Pa. He cries again till Uncle Pa pats him on the back. It's terrible, terrible, says Uncle Pa, but you'll get over this in time. Dad straightens up and looks at him. Never, he says. Never. Next day we rode to the hospital in a carriage with a horse. They put Oliver in a white box that came with us in the carriage and we took him to the graveyard. They put the white box into a hole in the ground and covered it with earth. My mother and Aunt Aggie cried, Grandma looked angry, Dad, Uncle Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat Sheehan looked sad but did not cry and I thought that if you're a man you can cry only when you have the black stuff that is called the pint. I did not like the jackdaws that perched on trees and gravestones and I did not want to leave Oliver with them. I threw a rock at a jackdaw that waddled over toward Oliver's grave. Dad said I shouldn't throw rocks at jackdaws, they might be somebody's soul. I didn't know what a soul was but I didn't ask him because I didn't care. Oliver was dead and I hated jackdaws. I'd be a man someday and I'd come back with a bag of rocks and I'd leave the graveyard littered with dead jackdaws. The morning after Oliver's burial Dad went to the Labour Exchange to sign and collect the week's dole, nineteen shillings and sixpence. He said he'd be home by noon, that he'd get coal and make a fire, that we'd have rashers and eggs and tea in honor of Oliver, that we might even have a sweet or two. He wasn't home by noon, or one, or two, and we boiled and ate the few potatoes the shopkeepers had given the day before. He wasn't home anytime before the sun went down that day in May. There was no sign of him till we heard him, long after the pubs closed, rolling along Windmill Street, singing, When all around a vigil keep, The West's asleep, the West's asleep- Alas, and well may Erin weep When Connacht lies in slumber deep. There lake and plain smile fair and free, 'Mid rocks their guardian chivalry. Sing, Oh, let man learn liberty From crashing wind and lashing sea. He stumbled into the room, hanging on to the wall. A snot oozed from his nose and he wiped it away with the back of his hand. He tried to speak. Zeeze shildren should be in bed. Lishen to me. Shildren go to bed. Mam faced him. These children are hungry. Where's the dole money? We'll get fish and chips so they'll have something in their bellies when they go to sleep. She tried to stick her hands into his pockets but he pushed her away. Have respheck, he said. Reshpeck in front of shildren. She struggled to get at his pockets. Where's the money? The children are hungry. You mad oul' bastard, did you drink all the money again? Just what you did in Brooklyn. He blubbered, Och, poor Angela. And poor wee Margaret and poor wee Oliver. He staggered to me and hugged me and I smelled the drink I used to smell in America. My face was wet from his tears and his spit and his snot and I was hungry and I didn't know what to say when he cried all over my head. Then he let me go and hugged Malachy, still going on about the wee sister and the wee brother cold in the ground, and how we all have to pray and be good, how we have to be obedient and do what our mother tells us. He said we have our troubles but it's time for Malachy and me to start school because there's nothing like an education, it will stand to you in the end, and you have to get ready to do your bit for Ireland. *** Mam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Windmill Street. She can't sleep with the memory of Oliver in that room, Oliver in the bed, Oliver playing on the floor, Oliver sitting on Dad's lap by the fire. She says it's not good for Eugene to be in that place, that a twin will suffer more over the loss of his brother than even a mother can understand. There's a room going on Hartstonge Street with two beds instead of the one we have here for the six of us, no, the five of us. We're getting that room and to make sure she's going to the Labour Exchange on Thursday to stand in the queue to take the dole money the minute it's handed to Dad. He says she can't do that, he'd be disgraced with the other men. The Labour Exchange is a place for men not for women taking the money from under their noses. She says, Pity about you. If you didn't squander the money in the pubs I wouldn't have to follow you the way I did in Brooklyn. He tells her he'll be shamed forever. She says she doesn't care. She wants that room on Hartstonge Street, a nice warm comfortable room with a lavatory down the hall like the one in Brooklyn, a room without fleas and the dampness that kills. She wants that room because it's on the same street as Leamy's National School and Malachy and I can come home at the dinner hour, which is noon, for a cup of tea and a cut of fried bread. On Thursday Mam follows Dad to the Labour Exchange. She marches in behind him and when the man pushes the money toward Dad she takes it. The other men on the dole nudge each other and grin and Dad is disgraced because a woman is never supposed to interfere with a man's dole money. He might want to put sixpence on a horse or have a pint and if all the women start acting like Mam the horses will stop running and Guinness will go broke. But she has the money now and we move to Hartstonge Street. Then she carries Eugene in her arms and we go up the street to Leamy's National School. The headmaster, Mr. Scallan, says we are to return on Monday with a composition book, a pencil, and a pen with a good nib on it. We are not to come to school with ringworm or lice and our noses are to be blown at all times, not on the floor, that spreads the consumption, or on our sleeves, but in a handkerchief or a clean rag. He asks us if we are good boys and when we say we are, he says, Good Lord, what's this? Are they Yanks or what? Mam tells him about Margaret and Oliver and he says, Lord above, Lord above, there's great suffering in the world. Anyway, we'll put the little fellow, Malachy, in the infants' class and his brother in first class. They're in the same room with one master. Monday morning, then, nine o'clock prompt. The boys in Leamy's want to know why we talk like that. Are ye Yanks or what? And when we tell them we came from America they want to know, Are ye gangsters or cowboys? A big boy sticks his face up to mine. I'm asking ye a question, he says. Are ye gangsters or cowboys? I tell him I don't know and when he pokes his finger into my chest Malachy says, I'm a gangster, Frank's a cowboy. The big boy says, Your little brother is smart and you're a stupid Yank. The boys around him are excited. Fight, they yell, fight, and he pushes me so hard I fall. I want to cry but the blackness comes over me the way it did with Freddie Leibowitz and I rush at him, kicking and punching. I knock him down and try to grab his hair to bang his head on the ground but there's a sharp sting across the backs of my legs and I'm pulled away from him. Mr. Benson, the master, has me by the ear and he's whacking me across the legs. You little hooligan, he says. Is that the kind of behavior you brought from America? Well, by God, you'll behave yourself before I'm done with you. He tells me hold out one hand and then the other and hits me with his stick once on each hand. Go home now, he says, and tell your mother what a bad boy you were. You're a bad Yank. Say after me, I'm a bad boy. I'm a bad boy. Now say, I'm a bad Yank. I'm a bad Yank. Malachy says, He's not a bad boy. It's that big boy. He said we were cowboys and gangsters. Is that what you did, Heffernan? I was only jokin', sir. No more joking, Heffernan. It's not their fault that they're Yanks. 'Tisn't, sir. And you, Heffernan, should get down on your two knees every night and thank God you're not a Yank for if you were, Heffernan, you'd be the greatest gangster on two sides of the Atlantic. Al Capone would be coming to you for lessons. You're not to be bothering these two Yanks anymore, Heffernan. I won't, sir. And if you do, Heffernan, I'll hang your pelt on the wall. Now go home, all of ye. There are seven masters in Leamy's National School and they all have leather straps, canes, blackthorn sticks. They hit you with the sticks on the shoulders, the back, the legs, and, especially, the hands. If they hit you on the hands it's called a slap. They hit you if you're late, if you have a leaky nib on your pen, if you laugh, if you talk, and if you don't know things. They hit you if you don't know why God made the world, if you don't know the patron saint of Limerick, if you can't recite the Apostles' Creed, if you can't add nineteen to forty-seven, if you can't subtract nineteen from forty-seven, if you don't know the chief towns and products of the thirty-two counties of Ireland, if you can't find Bulgaria on the wall map of the world that's blotted with spit, snot, and blobs of ink thrown by angry pupils expelled forever. They hit you if you can't say your name in Irish, if you can't say the Hail Mary in Irish, if you can't ask for the lavatory pass in Irish. It helps to listen to the big boys ahead of you. They can tell you about the master you have now, what he likes and what he hates. One master will hit you if you don't know that Eamon De Valera is the greatest man that ever lived. Another master will hit you if you don't know that Michael Collins was the greatest man that ever lived. Mr. Benson hates America and you have to remember to hate America or he'll hit you. Mr. O'Dea hates England and you have to remember to hate England or he'll hit you. If you ever say anything good about Oliver Cromwell they'll all hit you. Even if they slap you six times on each hand with the ash plant or the blackthorn with the knobs you must not cry. You'll be a sissy. There are boys who might jeer at you and mock you on the street but even they have to be careful because the day will come when the master hits and slaps them and they have to keep the tears behind their eyes or be disgraced forever. Some boys say it is better to cry because that pleases the masters. If you don't cry the masters hate you because you've made them look weak before the class and they promise themselves the next time they have you up they'll draw tears or blood or both. Big boys in fifth class tell us Mr. O'Dea likes to get you in front of the class so that he can stand behind you, pinch your sideburns, which are called cossicks, pull up on them. Up, up, he says, till you're on tiptoe and the tears are filling your eyes. You don't want the boys in the class to see you cry but pulling on the cossicks makes the tears come whether you like it or not and the master likes that. Mr. O'Dea is the one master who can always bring the tears and the shame. It is better not to cry because you have to stick with the boys in the school and you never want to give the masters any satisfaction. If the master hits you there's no use complaining to your father or mother. They always say, You deserve it. Don't be a baby. I know Oliver is dead and Malachy knows Oliver is dead but Eugene is too small to know anything. When he wakes in the morning he says, Ollie, Ollie, and toddles around the room looking under the beds or he climbs up on the bed by the window and points to children on the street, especially children with fair hair like him and Oliver. Ollie, Ollie, he says, and Mam picks him up, sobs, hugs him. He struggles to get down because he doesn't want to be picked up and hugged. He wants to find Oliver. Dad and Mam tell him Oliver is in heaven playing with angels and we'll all see him again someday but he doesn't understand because he's only two and doesn't have the words and that's the worst thing in the whole world. Malachy and I play with him. We try to make him laugh. We make funny faces. We put pots on our heads and pretend to let them fall off. We run across the room and pretend to fall down. We take him to the People's Park to see the lovely flowers, play with dogs, roll in the grass. He sees small children with fair hair like Oliver. He doesn't say Ollie anymore. He only points. Dad says Eugene is lucky to have brothers like Malachy and me because we help him forget and soon, with God's help, he'll have no memory of Oliver at all. *** He died anyway. Six months after Oliver went, we woke on a mean November morning and there was Eugene, cold in the bed beside us. Dr. Troy came and said that child died of pneumonia and why wasn't he in the hospital long ago? Dad said he didn't know and Mam said she didn't know and Dr. Troy said that's why children die. People don't know. He said if Malachy or I showed the slightest sign of a cough or the faintest rattle in the throat we were to be brought to him no matter what time of day or night. We were to be kept dry at all times because there seemed to be a bit of a weakness in the chest in this family. He told Mam he was very sorry for her troubles and he'd give her a prescription for something to ease the pain of the days to come. He said God was asking too much, too damn much. Grandma came over to our room with Aunt Aggie. She washed Eugene, and Aunt Aggie went to a shop for a little white gown and a set of rosary beads. They dressed him in a white gown and laid him on the bed by the window where he used to look out for Oliver. They placed his hands on his chest, one hand on top of the other, bound in the little white rosary beads. Grandma brushed the hair back from his eyes and forehead and she said, Doesn't he have lovely soft silky hair? Mam went to the bed and pulled a blanket over his legs to keep him warm. Grandma and Aunt Aggie looked at each other and said nothing. Dad stood at the end of the bed beating his fists against his thighs, talking to Eugene, telling him, Och, it was the River Shannon that harmed you, the dampness from that river that came and took you and Oliver. Grandma said, Will you stop that? You're making the whole house nervous. She took Dr. Troy's prescription and told me run over to O'Connor the chemist for the pills, that there would be no charge due to the kindness of Dr. Troy. Dad said he'd come with me, that we'd go to the Jesuit church and say a prayer for Margaret and Oliver and Eugene, all happy in heaven. The chemist gave us the pills, we stopped to say the prayers, and when we returned to the room, Grandma gave Dad money to bring a few bottles of stout from the pub. Mam said, No, no, but Grandma said, He doesn't have the pills to ease him, God help us, and a bottle of stout will be some small comfort. Then she told him he'd have to go to the undertaker tomorrow to bring the coffin back in a carriage. She told me to go with my father and make sure he didn't stay in the pub all night and drink all the money. Dad said, Och, Frankie shouldn't be in pubs, and she said, Then don't stay there. He put on his cap and we went to South's pub and he told me at the door I could go home now, that he'd be home after one pint. I said, No, and he said, Don't be disobedient. Go home to your poor mother. I said, No, and he said I was a bad boy and God would be displeased. I said I wasn't going home without him and he said, Och, what is the world coming to? He had one quick pint of porter in the pub and we went home with the bottles of stout. Pa Keating was in our room with a small bottle of whiskey and bottles of stout and Uncle Pat Sheehan brought two bottles of stout for himself. Uncle Pat sat on the floor with his arms around his bottles and he kept saying, They're mine, they're mine, for fear they'd be taken from him. People who were dropped on their heads always worry someone will steal their stout. Grandma said, All right, Pat, drink your stout yourself. No one will bother you. She and Aunt Aggie sat on the bed by Eugene. Pa Keating sat at the kitchen table drinking his stout and offering everyone a sip of his whiskey. Mam took her pills and sat by the fire with Malachy on her lap. She kept saying Malachy had hair like Eugene and Aunt Aggie said no he did not till Grandma drove her elbow into Aunt Aggie's chest and told her shut up. Dad stood against the wall drinking his stout between the fireplace and the bed with Eugene. Pa Keating told stories and the big people laughed even though they didn't want to laugh or they weren't supposed to laugh in the presence of a dead child. He said when he was in the English army in France the Germans sent gas over which made him so sick they had to take him to the hospital. They kept him in the hospital a while and then sent him back to the trenches. English soldiers were sent home but they didn't give a fiddler's fart about the Irish soldiers, whether they lived or died. Instead of dying Pa made a vast fortune. He said he solved one of the great problems of trench warfare. In the trenches it was so wet and muddy they had no way of boiling the water for the tea. He said to himself, Jasus, I have all this gas in my system and 'tis a great pity to waste it. So he shoved a pipe up his arse, lit a match to it, and there in a second he had a fine flame ready to boil water in any billycan. Tommies came running from trenches all around when they heard the news and they gave him any amount of money if he'd let them boil water. He made so much money he was able to bribe the generals to let him out of the army and off he went to Paris where he had a fine time drinking wine with artists and models. He had such a high time of it he spent all his money and when he came back to Limerick the only job he could get was in the gas works shoveling coal into the furnaces. He said there was so much gas in his system now he could supply light to a small town for a year. Aunt Aggie sniffed and said that was not a proper story to be telling in the presence of a dead child and Grandma said it was better to have a story like that than to be sitting around with the long face. Uncle Pat Sheehan, sitting on the floor with his stout, said he was going to sing a song. More power to you, said Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat sang ""The Road to Rasheen. "" He kept saying, Rasheen, Rasheen, mavourneen mean, and the song made no sense because his father dropped him on his head long ago and every time he sang that song he had different words. Grandma said that was a fine song and Pa Keating said Caruso better look over his shoulder. Dad went over to the bed in the corner where he slept with Mam. He sat on the edge, put his bottle on the floor, covered his face with his hands and cried. He said, Frank, Frank, come here, and I had to go to him so that he could hug me the way Mam was hugging Malachy. Grandma said, We better go now and sleep a bit before the funeral tomorrow. They each knelt by the bed and said a prayer and kissed Eugene's forehead. Dad put me down, stood up and nodded to them as they left. When they were gone he lifted each of the stout bottles to his mouth and drained it. He ran his finger inside the whiskey bottle and licked it. He turned down the flame in the paraffin oil lamp on the table and said it was time for Malachy and me to be in bed. We'd have to sleep with him and Mam that night as little Eugene would be needing the bed for himself. It was dark in the room now except for the sliver of streetlight that fell on Eugene's lovely soft silky hair. Dad lights the fire in the morning, makes the tea, toasts the bread in the fire. He brings Mam's toast and tea but she waves it away and turns to the wall. He brings Malachy and me to Eugene to kneel and say a prayer. He says the prayers of one child like us are worth more in heaven than the prayers of ten cardinals and forty bishops. He shows us how to bless ourselves, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen, and he says, Dear God, this is what you want, isn't it? You want my son, Eugene. You took his brother, Oliver, You took his sister, Margaret. I'm not supposed to question that, am I? Dear God above, I don't know why children have to die but that is Your will. You told the river to kill and the Shannon killed. Could You at last be merciful? Could You leave us the children we have? That is all we ask. Amen. He helps Malachy and me wash our heads and feet so that we'll be clean for Eugene's funeral. We have to be very quiet even when he hurts us cleaning our ears with the corner of the towel we brought from America. We have to be quiet because Eugene is there with his eyes closed and we don't want him to be waking up and looking out the window for Oliver. Grandma comes and tells Mam she has to get up. There are children dead, she says, but there are children alive and they need their mother. She brings Mam a little tea in a mug to wash down the pills that ease the pain. Dad tells Grandma it's Thursday and he has to go to the Labour Exchange for the dole and then down to the undertaker to bring the mourning carriage and the coffin. Grandma tells him to take me with him but he says it's better for me to stay with Malachy so that I can pray for my little brother dead in the bed. Grandma says, Is it coddin' me you are? Pray for a little child that's barely two and already playing with his little brother in heaven? You'll take your son with you and he'll remind you this is no day for the pubs. She looks at him and he looks at her and he puts on his cap. At the Labour Exchange we stand at the end of the queue till a man comes from behind the counter and tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and he should go ahead of everyone else on this sorrowful day. Men touch their caps and say they're sorry for his troubles and some pat my head and give me pennies, twenty-four pennies, two shillings. Dad tells me I'm rich now and I should buy myself a sweet while he goes into this place for a minute. I know this place is a pub and I know he wants to get the black stuff that is called a pint but I don't say anything because I want to go to the shop next door for a piece of toffee. I chew my toffee till it melts and leaves my mouth all sweet and sticky. Dad is still in the pub and I wonder if I should get another piece of toffee as long as he's in there with the pint. I'm about to give the money to the woman in the shop when my hand is slapped down and there's Aunt Aggie, raging. Is this what you do, she says, on the day of your brother's funeral? Gorgin' yourself on sweets. And where's that father of yours? He's, he's, in the pub. Of course he's in the pub. You out here stuffin' yourself with sweets and him in there gettin' himself into a staggerin' condition the day your poor little brother goes to the graveyard. She tells the shop woman, Just like his father, the same odd manner, the same oul' northern jaw. She tells me get into that pub and tell my father to stop the drinking and get the coffin and the carriage. She will not set foot inside the pub for the drink is the curse of this poor godforsaken country. Dad is sitting at the back of the pub with a man who has a dirty face and hair growing out of his nose. They're not talking but staring straight ahead and their black pints are resting on a small white coffin on the seat between them. I know that's Eugene's coffin because Oliver had one like it and I want to cry when I see the black pints on top of it. I'm sorry now I ever ate that toffee and I wish I could take it out of my stomach and give it back to the woman in the shop because it's not right to be eating toffee when Eugene is dead in the bed and I'm frightened by the two black pints on his white coffin. The man with Dad is saying, No, mister, you can't leave a child's coffin in a carriage no more. I did that once, went in for a pint and they robbed that little coffin out of the bloody carriage. Can you credit that? It was empty, thank God, but there you are. Desperate times we live in, desperate. The man with Dad lifts his pint and takes a long swallow and when he puts his glass down there's a hollow sound in the coffin. Dad nods at me. We'll be going in a minute, son, but when he goes to put his glass on the coffin after the long swallow I push it away. That's Eugene's coffin. I'll tell Mam you put your glass on Eugene's coffin. Now, son. Now, son. Dad, that's Eugene's coffin. The other man says, Will we have another pint, mister? Dad says to me, Wait outside another few minutes, Francis. No. Don't be a bad boy. No. The other man says, By Jesus, if that was my son I'd kick his arse from here to the County Kerry. He have no right to be talkin' to his father in that manner on a sorrowful day. If a man can't have a pint the day of a funeral what's the use of livin' at all, at all. Dad says, All right. We'll go. They finish their pints and wipe the wet brown stains off the coffin with their sleeves. The man climbs up to the driver's seat of the carriage and Dad and I ride inside. He has the coffin on his lap and he presses it against his chest. At home our room is filled with big people, Mam, Grandma, Aunt Aggie, her husband, Pa Keating, Uncle Pat Sheehan, Uncle Tom Sheehan, who is Mam's oldest brother and who never came near us before because he hates people from the North of Ireland. Uncle Tom has his wife, Jane, with him. She's from Galway and people say she has the look of a Spaniard and that's why no one in the family talks to her. The man takes the coffin from Dad and when he brings it into the room Mam moans, Oh, no, oh, God, no. The man tells Grandma he'll be back in awhile to take us to the graveyard. Grandma tells him he'd better not come back to this house in a drunken state because this child that's going to the graveyard suffered greatly and deserves a bit of dignity and she won't put up with a driver that's drunk and ready to fall out of the high seat. The man says, Missus, I drove dozens o' children to the graveyard an' never once fell out of any seat, high or low. The men are drinking stout from bottles again and the women are sipping sherry from jam jars. Uncle Pat Sheehan tells everyone, This is my stout, this is my stout, and Grandma says, 'Tis all right, Pat. No one will take your stout. Then he says he wants to sing ""The Road to Rasheen"" till Pa Keating says, No, Pat, you can't sing on the day of a funeral. You can sing the night before. But Uncle Pat keeps saying, This is my stout and I want to sing ""The Road to Rasheen, "" and everyone knows he talks like that because he was dropped on his head. He starts to sing his song but stops when Grandma takes the lid off the coffin and Mam sobs, Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, will it ever stop? Will I be left with one child? Mam is sitting on a chair at the head of the bed. She's stroking Eugene's hair and face and hands. She tells him that of all the children in the world he was the sweetest and the most delicate and loving. She tells him 'tis a terrible thing to lose him but isn't he in heaven now with his brother and his sister and isn't that a comfort to us, knowing Oliver is no longer lonesome for his twin. Still, she puts her head down next to Eugene and cries so hard all the women in the room cry with her. She cries till Pa Keating tells her we have to go before the darkness falls, that we can't be in graveyards in the dark. Grandma whispers to Aunt Aggie, Who'll put the child in the coffin? and Aunt Aggie whispers, I won't. That's the job for the mother. Uncle Pat hears them. I'll put the child in the coffin, he says. He limps to the bed and places his arms around Mam's shoulders. She looks up at him and her face is drenched. He says, I'll put the child in the coffin, Angela. Oh, Pat, she says. Pat. I can do it, he says. Sure he's only a small child an' I never lifted a small child before in my life. I never had a small child in me arms. I won't drop him, Angela. I won't. Honest to God, I won't. I know you won't, Pat. I know you won't. I'll lift him an' I won't be singin'""The Road to Rasheen."" I know you won't, Pat, Mam says. Pat pulls down the blanket Mam put there to keep Eugene warm. Eugene's feet are white and bright with little blue veins. Pat bends over, picks up Eugene and holds him against his chest. He kisses Eugene's forehead and then everyone in the room kisses Eugene. He places Eugene in the coffin and steps back. We are all gathered around looking at Eugene for the last time. Uncle Pat says, See, I didn't drop him, Angela, and she touches his face. Aunt Aggie goes to the pub for the driver. He puts the lid on the coffin and screws it down. He says, Who's comin' in the carriage? and takes the coffin to the carriage. There's room only for Mam and Dad, Malachy and me. Grandma says, Ye go ahead to the graveyard and we'll wait here. I don't know why we can't keep Eugene. I don't know why they have to send him away with that man who puts his pint on the white coffin. I don't know why they had to send Margaret away and Oliver. It is a bad thing to put my sister and my brothers in a box and I wish I could say something to someone. The horse clop-clopped through the streets of Limerick. Malachy said, Are we going to see Oliver? and Dad said, No, Oliver is in heaven and don't ask me what heaven is because I don't know. Mam said, Heaven is a place where Oliver and Eugene and Margaret are happy and warm and we'll see them there some day. Malachy said, The horse did his doodoo on the street and there was a smell, and Mam and Dad had to smile. At the graveyard the driver climbs down and opens the door of the carriage. Gimme that coffin, he says, an' I'll carry it up to the grave. He yanks at the coffin and stumbles. Mam says, You're not carrying my child in the condition you're in. She turns to Dad. You carry him, she says. Do what you like, says the driver. Do what you bloody well like, and he climbs up to his seat. It's getting dark now and the coffin seems whiter than ever in Dad's arms. Mam takes our hands and we follow Dad through the graves. The jackdaws are quiet in the trees because their day is nearly over and they have to rest so that they can get up early in the morning and feed their babies. Two men with shovels are waiting by a small open grave. One man says, Ye are very late. Good thing this is a small job or we'd be gone. He climbs into the grave. Hand it to me, he says, and Dad hands him the coffin. The man sprinkles some straw and grass on the coffin and as he climbs out the other man shovels in the earth. Mam lets out a long cry, Oh, Jesus, Jesus, and a jackdaw croaks in a tree. I wish I had a rock to hit that jackdaw. When the men finish shoveling in the earth they wipe their foreheads and wait. One says, Ah, well, now, there's usually a little something for the thirst that's in it. Dad says, Oh, yes, yes, and gives them money. They say, Sorry for your troubles, and they leave. We make our way back to the carriage at the graveyard gate but the carriage is gone. Dad looks around in the darkness and comes back shaking his head. Mam says, That driver is nothing but a dirty old drunkard, God forgive me. It's a long walk from the graveyard to our room. Mam tells Dad, These children need some nourishment and you have money left from the dole this morning. If you're thinking of going to the pubs tonight you can forget it. We're taking them to Naughton's and they can have fish and chips and lemonade for 'tisn't every day they bury a brother. The fish and chips are delicious with vinegar and salt and the lemonade is tart in our throats. When we get home the room is empty. There are empty stout bottles on the table and the fire is out. Dad lights the paraffin oil lamp and you can see the hollow left in the pillow by Eugene's head. You expect to hear him and see him toddling across the room, climbing up on the bed to look out the window for Oliver. Dad tells Mam he's going out for a walk. She says no. She knows what he's up to, that he can't wait to spend his last few shillings in the pubs. All right, he says. He lights the fire and Mam makes tea and soon we're in bed. Malachy and I are back in the bed where Eugene died. I hope he's not cold in that white coffin in the graveyard though I know he's not there anymore because angels come to the graveyard and open the coffin and he's far from the Shannon dampness that kills, up in the sky in heaven with Oliver and Margaret where they have plenty of fish and chips and toffee and no aunts to bother you, where all the fathers bring home the money from the Labour Exchange and you don't have to be running around to pubs to find them. III Mam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Hartstonge Street. She sees Eugene morning, noon and night. She sees him climbing the bed to look out at the street for Oliver and sometimes she sees Oliver outside and Eugene inside, the two of them chatting away. She's happy they're chatting like that but she doesn't want to be seeing and hearing them the rest of her life. It's a shame to move when we're so near Leamy's National School but if she doesn't move soon she'll go out of her mind and wind up in the lunatic asylum. We move to Roden Lane on top of a place called Barrack Hill. There are six houses on one side of the lane, one on the opposite side. The houses are called two up, two down, two rooms on top, two on the bottom. Our house is at the end of the lane, the last of the six. Next to our door is a small shed, a lavatory, and next to that a stable. Mam goes to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to see if there's any chance of getting furniture. The man says he'll give us a docket for a table, two chairs, and two beds. He says we'll have to go to a second- hand furniture shop down in the Irishtown and haul the furniture home ourselves. Mam says we can use the pram she had for the twins and when she says that she cries. She wipes her eyes on her sleeves and asks the man if the beds we're getting are secondhand. He says of course they are, and she says she's very worried about sleeping in beds someone might have died in, especially if they had the consumption. The man says, I'm very sorry, but beggars can't be choosers. It takes us all day to haul the furniture on the pram from one end of Limerick to the other. There are four wheels on the pram but one is bockety, it wants to go in a different direction. We have two beds, one sideboard with a mirror, a table and two chairs. We're happy with the house. We can walk from room to room and up and down the stairs. You feel very rich when you can go up and down the stairs all day as much as you please. Dad lights the fire and Mam makes the tea. He sits at the table on one chair, she sits on the other and Malachy and I sit on the trunk we brought from America. While we're drinking our tea an old man passes our door with a bucket in his hand. He empties the bucket into the lavatory and flushes and there's a powerful stink in our kitchen. Mam goes to the door and says, Why are you emptying your bucket in our lavatory? He raises his cap to her. Your lavatory, missus? Ah, no. You're making a bit of a mistake there, ha, ha. This is not your lavatory. Sure, isn't this the lavatory for the whole lane. You'll see passing your door here the buckets of eleven families and I can tell you it gets very powerful here in the warm weather, very powerful altogether. 'Tis December now, thank God, with a chill in the air and Christmas around the corner and the lavatory isn't that bad, but the day will come when you'll be calling for a gas mask. So, good night to you, missus, and I hope you'll be happy in your house. Mam says, Wait a minute, sir. Could you tell me who cleans this lavatory? Cleans? Ah, Jasus, that's a good one. Cleans, she says. Is it joking you are? These houses were built in the time of Queen Victoria herself and if this lavatory was ever cleaned it must have been done by someone in the middle of the night when no one was lookin'. And he shuffles up the lane laughing away to himself. Mam comes back to her chair and her tea. We can't stay here, she says. That lavatory will kill us with all diseases. Dad says, We can't move again. Where will we get a house for six shillings a week? We'll keep the lavatory clean ourselves. We'll boil buckets of water and throw them in there. Oh, will we? says Mam, and where will we get the coal or turf or blocks to be boiling water? Dad says nothing. He finishes his tea and looks for a nail to hang our one picture. The man in the picture has a thin face. He wears a yellow skullcap and a black robe with a cross on his chest. Dad says he was a Pope, Leo the Thirteenth, a great friend of the workingman. He brought this picture all the way from America where he found it thrown out by someone who had no time for the workingman. Mam says he's talking a lot of bloody nonsense and he says she shouldn't say bloody in front of the children. Dad finds a nail but wonders how he's going to get it into the wall without a hammer. Mam says he could go borrow one from the people next door but he says you don't go around borrowing from people you don't know. He leans the picture against the wall and drives the nail with the bottom of a jam jar. The jam jar breaks and cuts his hand and a blob of blood falls on the Pope's head. He wraps his hand in the dish rag and tells Mam, Quick, quick, wipe the blood off the Pope before it dries. She tries to wipe the blood away with her sleeve but it's wool and spreads the blood till the whole side of the Pope's face is smeared. Dad says, Lord above, Angela, you've destroyed the Pope entirely, and she says, Arrah, stop your whining, we'll get some paint and go over his face some day, and Dad says, He's the only Pope that was ever a friend to the workingman and what are we to say if someone from the St. Vincent de Paul Society comes in and sees blood all over him? Mam says, I don't know. It's your blood and 'tis a sad thing when a man can't even drive a nail straight. It just goes to show how useless you are. You'd be better off digging fields and anyway I don't care. I have pain in my back and I'm going to bed. Och, what am I going to do? Dad says. Take down the Pope and hide him in the coal hole under the stairs where he won't be seen and he'll be out of harm's way. I can't, says Dad. It would be bad luck. Coal hole is no place for a Pope. When the Pope is up, he's up. Suit yourself, says Mam. I will, says Dad. This is our first Christmas in Limerick and the girls are out in the lane, skipping rope and singing, Christmas is coming And the goose is getting fat, Please put a penny In the old man's hat. If you haven't a penny A ha'penny will do And if you haven't a ha'penny God bless you. Boys tease the girls and call out, May your mother have an accident Abroad in the loo. Mam says she'd like to have a nice Christmas dinner but what can you do when the Labour Exchange reduces the dole to sixteen shillings after Oliver and Eugene died? You pay the rent of six shillings, you have ten shillings left, and what use is that to four people? Dad can't get any work. He gets up early on weekdays, lights the fire, boils water for the tea and his shaving mug. He puts on a shirt and attaches a collar with studs. He puts on his tie and his cap and goes to the Labour Exchange to sign for the dole. He will never leave the house without collar and tie. A man without collar and tie is a man with no respect for himself. You never know when the clerk at the Labour Exchange might tell you there's a job going at Rank's Flour Mills or the Limerick Cement Company, and even if it's a laboring job what will they think if you appear without collar and tie? Bosses and foremen always show him respect and say they're ready to hire him, but when he opens his mouth and they hear the North of Ireland accent, they take a Limerickman instead. That's what he tells Mam by the fire and when she says, Why don't you dress like a proper workingman? he says he'll never give an inch, never let them know, and when she says, Why can't you try to talk like a Limerickman? he says he'll never sink that low and the greatest sorrow of his life is that his sons are now afflicted with the Limerick accent. She says, Sorry for your troubles and I hope that's all you'll ever have, and he says that some day, with God's help, we'll get out of Limerick and far from the Shannon that kills. I ask Dad what afflicted means and he says, Sickness, son, and things that don't fit. When he's not looking for work Dad goes for long walks, miles into the country. He asks farmers if they need any help, that he grew up on a farm and can do anything. If they hire him he goes to work right away with his cap on and his collar and tie. He works so hard and long the farmers have to tell him to stop. They wonder how a man can work through a long hot day with no thought of food or drink. Dad smiles. He never brings home the money he earns on farms. That money seems to be different from the dole, which is supposed to be brought home. He takes the farm money to the pub and drinks it. If he's not home when the Angelus rings at six o'clock Mam knows he had a day of work. She hopes he might think of his family and pass the pub even once, but he never does. She hopes he might bring home something from the farm, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, carrots, but he'll never bring home anything because he'd never stoop so low as to ask a farmer for anything. Mam says 'tis all right for her to be begging at the St. Vincent de Paul Society for a docket for food but he can't stick a few spuds in his pocket. He says it's different for a man. You have to keep the dignity. Wear your collar and tie, keep up the appearance, and never ask for anything. Mam says, I hope it keeps fine for you. When the farm money is gone he rolls home singing and crying over Ireland and his dead children, mostly about Ireland. If he sings Roddy McCorley, it means he had only the price of a pint or two. If he sings Kevin Barry, it means he had a good day, that he is now falling down drunk and ready to get us out of bed, line us up and make us promise to die for Ireland, unless Mam tells him leave us alone or she'll brain him with the poker. You wouldn't do that, Angela. I would and more. You better stop the nonsense and go to bed. Bed, bed, bed. What's the use of going to bed? If I go to bed I'll only have to get up again and I can't sleep in a place where there's a river sending poison to us in mist and fog. He goes to bed, pounds the wall with his fist, sings a woeful song, falls asleep. He's up at daylight because no one should sleep beyond the dawn. He wakes Malachy and me and we're tired from being kept up the night before with his talking and singing. We complain and say we're sick, we're tired, but he pulls back the overcoats that cover us and forces us out on the floor. It's December and it's freezing and we can see our breath. We pee into the bucket by the bedroom door and run down stairs for the warmth of the fire Dad has already started. We wash our faces and hands in a basin that sits under the water tap by the door. The pipe that leads to the tap has to be held to the wall by a piece of twine looped around a nail. Everything around the tap is damp, the floor, the wall, the chair the basin sits on. The water from the tap is icy and our fingers turn numb. Dad says this is good for us, it will make men of us. He throws the icy water on his face and neck and chest to show there's nothing to fear. We hold our hands to the fire for the heat that's in it but we can't stay there long because we have to drink our tea and eat our bread and go to school. Dad makes us say grace before meals and grace after meals and he tells us be good boys at school because God is watching every move and the slightest disobedience will send us straight to hell where we'll never have to worry about the cold again. And he smiles. Two weeks before Christmas Malachy and I come home from school in a heavy rain and when we push in the door we find the kitchen empty. The table and chairs and trunk are gone and the fire is dead in the grate. The Pope is still there and that means we haven't moved again. Dad would never move without the Pope. The kitchen floor is wet, little pools of water all around, and the walls are twinkling with the damp. There's a noise upstairs and when we go up we find Dad and Mam and the missing furniture. It's nice and warm there with a fire blazing in the grate, Mam sitting in the bed, and Dad reading The Irish Press and smoking a cigarette by the fire. Mam tells us there was a terrible flood, that the rain came down the lane and poured in under our door. They tried to stop it with rags but they only turned sopping wet and let the rain in. People emptying their buckets made it worse and there was a sickening stink in the kitchen. She thinks we should stay upstairs as long as there is rain. We'll be warm through the winter months and then we can go downstairs in the springtime if there is any sign of a dryness in the walls or the floor. Dad says it's like going away on our holidays to a warm foreign place like Italy. That's what we'll call the upstairs from now on, Italy. Malachy says the Pope is still on the wall downstairs and he's going to be all cold and couldn't we bring him up? but Mam says, No, he's going to stay where he is because I don't want him on the wall glaring at me in the bed. Isn't it enough that we dragged him all the way from Brooklyn to Belfast to Dublin to Limerick? All I want now is a little peace, ease and comfort.... Mam takes Malachy and me to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to stand in the queue and see if there's any chance of getting something for the Christmas dinner-a goose or a ham, but the man says everyone in Limerick is desperate this Christmas. He gives her a docket for groceries at McGrath's shop and another one for the butcher. No goose, says the butcher, no ham. No fancy items when you bring the docket from the St. Vincent de Paul. What you can have now, missus, is black pudding and tripe or a sheep's head or a nice pig's head. No harm in a pig's head, missus, plenty of meat and children love it, slice that cheek, slather it with mustard and you're in heaven, though I suppose they wouldn't have the likes of that in America where they're mad for the steak and all classes of poultry, flying, walking or swimming itself. He tells Mam, no, she can't have boiled bacon or sausages and if she has any sense she'll take the pig's head before they're all gone the way the poor people of Limerick are clamoring for them. Mam says the pig's head isn't right for Christmas and he says 'tis more than the Holy Family had in that cold stable in Bethlehem long ago. You wouldn't find them complaining if someone offered them a nice fat pig's head. No, they wouldn't complain, says Mam, but they'd never eat the pig's head. They were Jewish. And what does that have to do with it? A pig's head is a pig's head. And a Jew is a Jew and 'tis against their religion and I don't blame them. The butcher says, Are you a bit of an expert, missus, on the Jews and the pig. I am not, says Mam, but there was a Jewish woman, Mrs. Leibowitz, in New York, and I don't know what we would have done without her. The butcher takes the pig's head off a shelf and when Malachy says, Ooh, look at the dead dog, the butcher and Mam burst out laughing. He wraps the head in newspaper, hands it to Mam and says, Happy Christmas. Then he wraps up some sausages and tells her, Take these sausages for your breakfast on Christmas Day. Mam says, Oh, I can't afford sausages, and he says, Am I asking you for money? Am I? Take these sausages. They might help make up for the lack of a goose or a ham. Sure, you don't have to do that, says Mam. I know that, missus. If I had to do it, I wouldn't. Mam says she has a pain in her back, that I'll have to carry the pig's head. I hold it against my chest but it's damp and when the newspaper begins to fall away everyone can see the head. Mam says, I'm ashamed of me life that the world should know we're having pig's head for Christmas. Boys from Leamy's National School see me and they point and laugh. Aw, Gawd, look at Frankie McCourt an'his pig's snout. Is that what the Yanks ate for Christmas dinner, Frankie? One calls to another, Hey, Christy, do you know how to ate a pig's head? No, I don't, Paddy. Grab him by the ears an' chew the face offa him. And Christy says, Hey, Paddy, do you know the only part of the pig the McCourts don't ate? No, I don't, Christy. The only part they don't ate is the oink. After a few streets the newspaper is gone altogether and everyone can see the pig's head. His nose is flat against my chest and pointing up at my chin and I feel sorry for him because he's dead and the world is laughing at him. My sister and two brothers are dead, too, but if anyone laughed at them I'd hit them with a rock. I wish Dad would come and help us because Mam has to stop every few steps and lean against a wall. She's holding her back and telling us she'll never be able to climb Barrack Hill. Even if Dad came he wouldn't be much use because he never carries anything, parcels, bags, packages. If you carry such things you lose your dignity. That's what he says. He carried the twins when they were tired and he carried the Pope, but that was not the same as carrying ordinary things like a pig's head. He tells Malachy and me that when you grow up you have to wear a collar and tie and never let people see you carry things. He's upstairs sitting by the fire, smoking a cigarette, reading The Irish Press, which he loves because it's De Valera's paper and he thinks De Valera is the greatest man in the world. He looks at me and the pig's head and tells Mam it's a disgraceful thing to let a boy carry an object like that through the streets of Limerick. She takes off her coat and eases herself into the bed and tells him that next Christmas he can go out and find the dinner. She's worn out and gasping for a cup of tea so would he drop his grand airs, boil the water for the tea and fry some bread before his two small sons starve to death. On Christmas morning he lights the fire early so that we can have sausages and bread and tea. Mam sends me to Grandma to see if we can borrow a pot for the pig's head. Grandma says, What are ye having for yeer dinner? Pig's head! Jesus, Mary an' Joseph, that's goin' beyond the beyonds. Couldn't your father get out and find a ham or a goose at least? What kind of man is he at all, at all? Mam puts the head in the pot, just covered with water, and while the pig is boiling away Dad takes Malachy and me to Mass at the Redemptorist church. It's warm in the church and sweet with flowers and incense and candles. He takes us to see the Baby Jesus in the crib. He's a big fat baby with fair curls like Malachy. Dad tells us that's Jesus' mother there, Mary, in the blue dress, and his father, St. Joseph, the old man with the beard. He says they're sad because they know Jesus will grow up and be killed so that we can all go to heaven. I ask why the Baby Jesus has to die and Dad says you can't ask questions like that. Malachy says, Why? and Dad tells him be quiet. Mam is in a terrible state at home. There isn't enough coal to cook the dinner, the water isn't boiling anymore and she says she's demented with worry. We'll have to go down the Dock Road again to see if there's any coal or turf lying around from the lorries. Surely we'll find something on the road this day of all days. Even the poorest of the poor don't go out on Christmas Day picking coal off the road. There's no use asking Dad to go because he will never stoop that low and even if he did he won't carry things through the streets. It's a rule he has. Mam can't go because of the pain in her back. She says, You'll have to go, Frank, and take Malachy with you. It's a long way to the Dock Road but we don't mind because our bellies are filled with sausages and bread and it's not raining. We carry a canvas bag Mam borrowed from Mrs. Hannon next door and Mam is right, there is no one on the Dock Road. The poor are all at home having pig's head or maybe a goose and we have the Dock Road to ourselves. We find bits of coal and turf stuck in cracks on the road and in the walls of the coal yards. We find bits of paper and cardboard that will be useful in starting the fire again. We're wandering around trying to fill the bag when Pa Keating comes along. He must have washed himself for Christmas because he's not as black as he was when Eugene died. He wants to know what we're doing with that bag and when Malachy tells him he says, Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! Christmas Day and ye don't have a fire for yeer pig's head. That's a bloody disgrace. He takes us to South's pub, which is not supposed to be open, but he's a regular customer and there's a back door for men who want their pint to celebrate the birthday of the Baby Jesus above in the crib. He orders his pint and lemonade for us and asks the man if there's any chance of getting a few lumps of coal. The man says he's been serving drink for twenty-seven years and nobody ever asked him for coal before. Pa says it would be a favor and the man says if Pa asked for the moon he'd fly up and bring it back. The man leads us to the coal hole under the stairs and tells us take what we can carry. It's real coal and not bits from the Dock Road and if we can't carry it we can drag it along the ground. It takes us a long time to go from South's pub to Barrack Hill because of a hole in the bag. I pull the bag and it's Malachy's job to pick up the lumps that fall through the hole and put them back again. Then it starts to rain and we can't stand in a doorway till it passes because we have that coal and it's leaving a black trail along the pavement and Malachy is turning black from picking up the lumps, pushing them into the bag and wiping the rain from his face with his wet black hands. I tell him he's black, he tells me I'm black, and a woman in a shop tells us get away from that door, 'tis Christmas Day and she doesn't want to be looking at Africa. We have to keep dragging the bag or we'll never have our Christmas dinner. It will take ages to get a fire going and ages more to get our dinner because the water has to be boiling when Mam puts in the head of cabbage and the potatoes to keep the pig company in the pot. We drag the bag up O'Connell Avenue and we see people in their houses sitting around tables with all kinds of decorations and bright lights. At one house they push up the window and the children point and laugh and call to us, Look at the Zulus. Where are yeer spears? Malachy makes faces at them and wants to throw coal at them but I tell him if he throws coal there's less for the pig and we'll never get our dinner. The downstairs in our house is a lake again from the rain pouring under the door but it doesn't matter because we're drenched anyway and we can wade through the water. Dad comes down and drags the bag upstairs to Italy. He says we're good boys for getting so much coal, that the Dock Road must have been covered with it. When Mam sees us she starts to laugh, and then she cries. She's laughing because we're so black and crying because we're sopping wet. She tells us take off all our clothes and she washes the coal off our hands and faces. She tells Dad the pig's head can wait a while so that we can have a jam jar of hot tea. It's raining outside and there's a lake downstairs in our kitchen but up here in Italy the fire is going again and the room is so dry and warm that, after our tea, Malachy and I doze off in the bed and we don't wake till Dad tells us the dinner is ready. Our clothes are still wet, so Malachy sits on the trunk at the table wrapped in Mam's red American overcoat and I'm wrapped in an old coat that Mam's father left behind when he went to Australia. There are delicious smells in the room, cabbage, potatoes, and the pig's head, but when Dad lifts the head from the pot to a plate Malachy says, Oh, the poor pig. I don't want to eat the poor pig. Mam says, If you were hungry you'd eat it. Now stop the nonsense and eat your dinner. Dad says, Wait a minute. He takes slices from the two cheeks, places them on our plates and smears them with mustard. He takes the plate that holds the pig's head and puts it on the floor under the table. Now, he says to Malachy, that's ham, and Malachy eats it because he's not looking at what it came from and it isn't pig's head anymore. The cabbage is soft and hot and there are plenty of potatoes with butter and salt. Mam peels our potatoes but Dad eats his skin and all. He says all the nourishment of a potato is in the skin and Mam says it's a good thing he's not eating eggs, he'd be chewing the shells and all. He says he would, and it's a disgrace that the Irish throw out millions of potato skins every day and that's why thousands are dying of consumption and surely there's nourishment in the shell of an egg since waste is the eighth deadly sin. If he had his way, and Mam says, Never mind your way. Eat your dinner. He eats half a potato with its skin on and puts the other half back in the pot. He eats a small slice of the pig's cheek and a leaf of cabbage and leaves the rest on his plate for Malachy and me. He makes more tea and we have that with bread and jam so that no one can say we didn't have a sweet on Christmas Day. It's dark now and still raining outside and the coal is glowing in the grate where Mam and Dad sit and smoke their cigarettes. There's nothing to do when your clothes are wet but get back into bed where it's cozy and your father can tell you a story about how Cuchulain became a Catholic and you fall asleep and dream about the pig standing in the crib at the Redemptorist church crying because he and the Baby Jesus and Cuchulain all have to grow up and die. The angel that brought Margaret and the twins comes again and brings us another brother, Michael. Dad says he found Michael on the seventh step of the stairs to Italy. He says that's what you have to watch for when you ask for a new baby, the Angel on the Seventh Step. Malachy wants to know how you can get a new brother from the Angel on the Seventh Step if you don't have any stairs in your house and Dad tells him that asking too many questions is an affliction. Malachy wants to know what an affliction is. Affliction. I'd like to know what that word means. Affliction, but Dad says, Och, child, the world is an affliction and everything in it, puts on his cap and goes to the Bedford Row Hospital to see Mam and Michael. She's in the hospital with the pain in her back and she has the baby with her to make sure he was healthy when he was left on the seventh step. I don't understand this because I'm sure angels would never leave a sick baby on the seventh step. There's no use asking Dad or Mam about this. They say, You're getting as bad as your brother for asking questions. Go play. I know that big people don't like questions from children. They can ask all the questions they like, How's school? Are you a good boy? Did you say your prayers? but if you ask them did they say their prayers you might be hit on the head. Dad brings Mam home with the new baby and she has to stay in bed for a few days with the pain in her back. She says this baby is the spitting image of our sister who died, with his wavy black hair, his lovely blue eyes, and the gorgeous eyebrows. That's what Mam says. I want to know if the baby will be spitting. I also want to know which is the seventh step because there are nine steps on the stairs and I'd like to know if you count from the bottom or the top. Dad doesn't mind answering this question. Angels come down from above, he says, and not up from kitchens like ours which are lakes from October till April. So I find the seventh step by counting from the top. The baby Michael has a cold. His head is stuffed and he can barely breathe. Mam worries because it's Sunday and the Dispensary for the poor is closed. If you go to the doctor's house and the maid sees you're from the lower classes she tells you go to the Dispensary where you belong. If you tell her the child is dying in your arms she'll say the doctor is in the country riding his horse. Mam cries because the baby is struggling to get air through his mouth. She tries to clear his nostrils with a bit of rolled up paper but she's afraid to push it too far up. Dad says, There's no need for that. You're not supposed to be pushing things inside a child's head. It looks like he's going to kiss the baby. Instead, he has his mouth on the little nose and he's sucking sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head. He spits it into the fire, Michael gives out a loud cry and you can see him drawing the air into his head and kicking his legs and laughing. Mam looks at Dad as if he just came down from heaven and Dad says, That's what we did in Antrim long before there were doctors riding their horses. Michael entitles us to a few extra shillings on the dole but Mam says it isn't enough and now she has to go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society for food. One night there is a knock on the door and Mam sends me down to see who it is. There are two men from the St. Vincent de Paul and they want to see my mother and father. I tell them my parents are upstairs in Italy and they say, What? Upstairs where 'tis dry. I'll tell them. They want to know what that little shed is beside our front door. I tell them it's the lavatory. They want to know why it isn't in the back of the house and I tell them it's the lavatory for the whole lane and it's a good thing it's not in the back of our house or we'd have people traipsing through our kitchen with buckets that would make you sick. They say, Are you sure there's one lavatory for the whole lane? I am. They say, Mother of God. Mam calls down from Italy. Who's down there? The men. What men? From the St. Vincent de Paul. They're careful the way they step into the lake in the kitchen and they make tsk tsk and tut tut noises and they tell one another, Isn't this a disgrace? till they get upstairs to Italy. They tell Mam and Dad they're sorry to disturb them but the Society has to be sure they're helping deserving cases. Mam offers them a cup of tea but they look around and say, No, thank you. They want to know why we're living upstairs. They want to know about the lavatory. They ask questions because big people can ask all the questions they like and write in notebooks, especially when they're wearing collars and ties and suits. They ask how old Michael is, how much Dad gets at the Labour Exchange, when did he last have a job, why doesn't he have a job now and what class of an accent is that he has? Dad tells them the lavatory could kill us with every class of disease, that the kitchen floods in the winter and we have to move upstairs to stay dry. He says the River Shannon is responsible for all the dampness in the world and killing us one by one. Malachy tells them we're living in Italy and they smile. Mam asks if there's any chance of getting boots for Malachy and me and they say she'll have to come down to Ozanam House and apply. She says she hasn't been feeling well since the baby came and she wouldn't be able to stand long in a queue, but they say everyone has to be treated the same, even a woman down in the Irishtown that had triplets and, thank you, we'll make our report to the Society. When they're leaving Malachy wants to show them where the angel left Michael on the seventh step but Dad tells him, Not now, not now. Malachy cries and one of the men gives him a piece of toffee from his pocket and I wish I had something to cry about so that I'd get a piece, too. I have to go downstairs again and show the men where to step to keep their feet dry. They keep shaking their heads and saying, God Almighty and Mother of God, this is desperate. That's not Italy they have upstairs, that's Calcutta. Dad is telling Mam up in Italy she should never beg like that. What do you mean, beg? Don't you have any pride, begging for boots like that? And what would you do, Mr. Grand Manner? Would you let them go barefoot? I'd rather fix the shoes they have. The shoes they have are falling to pieces. I can fix them, he says. You can't fix anything. You're useless, she says. He comes home the next day with an old bicycle tire. He sends me to Mr. Hannon next door for the loan of a last and a hammer. He takes Mam's sharp knife and he hacks at the tire till he has pieces to fit on the soles and heels of our shoes. Mam tells him he's going to destroy the shoes altogether but he pounds away with the hammer, driving the nails through the rubber pieces and into the shoes. Mam says, God above, if you left the shoes alone they'd last till Easter, at least, and we might get the boots from the St. Vincent de Paul. But he won't stop till the soles and heels are covered with squares of rubber tire which stick out on each side of the shoe and flop before and behind. He makes us put on the shoes and tells us our feet will be good and warm but we don't want to wear them anymore because the tire pieces are so lumpy we stumble when we walk around Italy. He sends me back to Mr. Hannon with the last and hammer and Mrs. Hannon says, God above, what's up with your shoes? She laughs and Mr. Hannon shakes his head and I feel ashamed. I don't want to go to school next day and I pretend to be sick but Dad gets us up and gives us our fried bread and tea and tells us we should be grateful we have any shoes at all, that there are boys in Leamy's National School who go to school barefoot on bitter days. On our way to school Leamy's boys laugh at us because the tire pieces are so thick they add a few inches to our height and the boys say, How's the air up there? There are six or seven barefoot boys in my class and they don't say anything and I wonder if it's better to have shoes with rubber tires that make you trip and stumble or to go barefoot. If you have no shoes at all you'll have all the barefoot boys on your side. If you have rubber tires on your shoes you're all alone with your brother and you have to fight your own battles. I sit on a bench in the schoolyard shed and take off my shoes and stockings but when I go into the class the master wants to know where my shoes are. He knows I'm not one of the barefoot boys and he makes me go back to the yard, bring in the shoes and put them on. Then he says to the class, There is sneering here. There is jeering at the misfortunes of others. Is there anyone in this class that thinks he's perfect? Raise your hands. There are no hands. Is there anyone in this class that comes from a rich family with money galore to spend on shoes? Raise your hands. There are no hands. He says, There are boys here who have to mend their shoes whatever way they can. There are boys in this class with no shoes at all. It's not their fault and it's no shame. Our Lord had no shoes. He died shoeless. Do you see Him hanging on the cross sporting shoes? Do you, boys? No, sir. What is it you don't see Our Lord doing? Hanging on the cross and sporting shoes, sir. Now if I hear of one boy in this class jeering and sneering at McCourt or his brother over their will come out, boys? The stick, sir. The stick will sting, boys. air, it will land on the backside sneers. Where will it land, boys? shoes the stick will come out. What The ash plant will whistle through the of the boy that jeers, the boy that On the boy that jeers, sir. And? The boy that sneers, sir. The boys bother us no more and we wear our shoes with the rubber tires the few weeks to Easter when the St. Vincent de Paul Society gives us the gift of boots. If I have to get up in the middle of the night to pee in the bucket I go to the top of the stairs and look down to see if the angel might be on the seventh step. Sometimes I'm sure there's a light there and if everyone's asleep I sit on the step in case the angel might be bringing another baby or just coming for a visit. I ask Mam if the angel just brings the babies and then forgets about them. She says, Of course not. The angel never forgets the babies and comes back to make sure the baby is happy. I could ask the angel all kinds of questions and I'm sure he'd answer, unless it's a girl angel. But I'm sure a girl angel would answer questions, too. I never heard anyone say they didn't. I sit on the seventh step a long time and I'm sure the angel is there. I tell him all the things you can't tell your mother or father for fear of being hit on the head or told go out and play. I tell him all about school and how I'm afraid of the master and his stick when he roars at us in Irish and I still don't know what he's talking about because I came from America and the other boys were learning Irish a year before me. I stay on the seventh step till it gets too cold or Dad gets up and tells me go back to bed. He's the one who told me the angel comes to the seventh step in the first place and you'd think he'd know why I'm sitting there. I told him one night that I was waiting for the angel, and he said, Och, now, Francis, you're a bit of a dreamer. I get back into bed but I can hear him whisper to my mother. The poor wee lad was sitting on the stairs talking away to an angel. He laughs and my mother laughs and I think, Isn't it curious the way big people laugh over the angel who brought them a new child. Before Easter we move back downstairs to Ireland. Easter is better than Christmas because the air is warmer, the walls are not dripping with the damp, and the kitchen isn't a lake anymore, and if we're up early we might catch the sun slanting for a minute through the kitchen window. In fine weather men sit outside smoking their cigarettes if they have them, looking at the world and watching us play. Women stand with their arms folded, chatting. They don't sit because all they do is stay at home, take care of the children, clean the house and cook a bit and the men need the chairs. The men sit because they're worn out from walking to the Labour Exchange every morning to sign for the dole, discussing the world's problems and wondering what to do with the rest of the day. Some stop at the bookie to study the form and place a shilling or two on a sure thing. Some spend hours in the Carnegie Library reading English and Irish newspapers. A man on the dole needs to keep up with things because all the other men on the dole are experts on what's going on in the world. A man on the dole must be ready in case another man on the dole brings up Hitler or Mussolini or the terrible state of the Chinese millions. A man on the dole goes home after a day with the bookie or the newspaper and his wife will not begrudge him a few minutes with the ease and peace of his cigarette and his tea and time to sit in his chair and think of the world. Easter is better than Christmas because Dad takes us to the Redemptorist church where all the priests wear white and sing. They're happy because Our Lord is in heaven. I ask Dad if the baby in the crib is dead and he says, No, He was thirty-three when He died and there He is, hanging on the cross. I don't understand how He grew up so fast that He's hanging there with a hat made of thorns and blood everywhere, dripping from His head, His hands, His feet, and a big hole near His belly. Dad says I'll understand when I grow up. He tells me that all the time now and I want to be big like him so that I can understand everything. It must be lovely to wake up in the morning and understand everything. I wish I could be like all the big people in the church, standing and kneeling and praying and understanding everything. At the Mass people go up to the altar and the priest puts something into their mouths. They come back to their seats with their heads down, their mouths moving. Malachy says he's hungry and he wants some, too. Dad says, Shush, that's Holy Communion, the body and blood of Our Lord. But, Dad. Shush, it's a mystery. There's no use asking more questions. If you ask a question they tell you it's a mystery, you'll understand when you grow up, be a good boy, ask your mother, ask your father, for the love o' Jesus leave me alone, go out and play. Dad gets his first job in Limerick at the cement factory and Mam is happy. She won't have to stand in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society asking for clothes and boots for Malachy and me. She says it's not begging, it's charity, but Dad says it's begging and shameful. Mam says she can now pay off the few pounds she owes at Kathleen O'Connell's shop and she can pay back what she owes her own mother. She hates to be under obligation to anyone, especially her own mother. The cement factory is miles outside Limerick and that means Dad has to be out of the house by six in the morning. He doesn't mind because he's used to the long walks. The night before Mam makes him a flask of tea, a sandwich, a hard-boiled egg. She feels sorry for him the way he has to walk three miles out and three miles back. A bicycle would be handy but you'd have to be working a year for the price of it. Friday is payday and Mam is out of the bed early, cleaning the house and singing. Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this... There isn't much to clean in the house. She sweeps the kitchen floor and the floor of Italy upstairs. She washes the four jam jars we use for mugs. She says if Dad's job lasts we'll get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day, with the help of God and His Blessed Mother, we'll have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the Great Famine. She boils water and washes the rags that keep Michael from shitting all over the pram and the house itself. Oh, she says, we'll have a lovely tea when your Pop brings home the wages tonight. Pop. She's in a good mood. Sirens and whistles go off all over the city when the men finish work at half-past five. Malachy and I are excited because we know that when your father works and brings home the wages you get the Friday Penny. We know this from other boys whose fathers work and we know that after your tea you can go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and buy sweets. If your mother is in a good mood she might even give you tuppence to go to the Lyric Cinema the next day to see a film with James Cagney. The men who work in factories and shops in the city are coming into the lanes to have their supper, wash themselves and go to the pub. The women go to the films at the Coliseum or the Lyric Cinema. They buy sweets and Wild Woodbine cigarettes and if their husbands are working a long time they treat themselves to boxes of Black Magic chocolates. They love the romance films and they have a great time crying their eyes out when there's an unhappy ending or a handsome lover goes away to be shot by Hindus and other non-Catholics. We have to wait a long time for Dad to walk the miles from the cement factory. We can't have our tea till he's home and that's very hard because you smell the cooking of other families in the lane. Mam says it's a good thing payday is Friday when you can't eat meat because the smell of bacon or sausages in other houses would drive her out of her mind. We can still have bread and cheese and a nice jam jar of tea with lashings of milk and sugar and what more do you want? The women are gone to the cinemas, the men are in the pubs, and still Dad isn't home. Mam says it's a long way to the cement factory even if he's a fast walker. She says that but her eyes are watery and she's not singing anymore. She's sitting by the fire smoking a Wild Woodbine she got on credit from Kathleen O'Connell. The fag is the only luxury she has and she'll never forget Kathleen for her goodness. She doesn't know how long she can keep the water boiling in this kettle. There's no use making the tea till Dad gets home because it will be stewed, coddled, boiled and unfit to drink. Malachy says he's hungry and she gives him a piece of bread and cheese to keep him going. She says, This job could be the saving of us. 'Tis hard enough for him to get a job with his northern accent and if he loses this one I don't know what we're going to do. The darkness is in the lane and we have to light a candle. She has to give us our tea and bread and cheese because we're so hungry we can't wait another minute. She sits at the table, eats a bit of bread and cheese, smokes her Wild Woodbine. She goes to the door to see if Dad is coming down the lane and she talks about the paydays when we searched for him all over Brooklyn. She says, Some day we'll all go back to America and we'll have a nice warm place to live and a lavatory down the hall like the one in Classon Avenue and not this filthy thing outside our door. The women are coming home from the cinemas, laughing, and the men, singing, from the pubs. Mam says there's no use waiting up any longer. If Dad stays in the pubs till closing time there will be nothing left from his wages and we might as well go to bed. She lies in her bed with Michael in her arms. It's quiet in the lane and I can hear her crying even though she pulls an old coat over her face and I can hear in the distance, my father. I know it's my father because he's the only one in Limerick who sings that song from the North, Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today. He comes round the corner at the top of the lane and starts Kevin Barry. He sings a verse, stops, holds on to a wall, cries over Kevin Barry. People stick their heads out windows and doors and tell him, For Jasus' sake, put a sock in it. Some of us have to get up in the morning for work. Go home and sing your feckin' patriotic songs. He stands in the middle of the lane and tells the world to step outside, he's ready to fight, ready to fight and die for Ireland, which is more than he can say for the men of Limerick, who are known the length and breadth of the world for collaborating with the perfidious Saxons. He's pushing in our door and singing, And if, when all a vigil keep, The West's asleep, the West's asleep! Alas! and well my Erin weep, That Connacht lies in slumber deep, But hark! a voice like thunder spake 'The West's awake! the West's awake! Sing, Oh, hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake!' He calls from the bottom of the stairs, Angela, Angela, is there a drop of tea in this house? She doesn't answer and he calls again, Francis, Malachy, come down here, boys. I have the Friday Penny for you. I want to go down and get the Friday Penny but Mam is sobbing with the coat over her mouth and Malachy says, I don't want his old Friday Penny. He can keep it. Dad is stumbling up the stairs, making a speech about how we all have to die for Ireland. He lights a match and touches it to the candle by Mam's bed. He holds the candle over his head and marches around the room, singing, See who comes over the red-blossomed heather, Their green banners kissing the pure mountain air, Heads erect, eyes to front, stepping proudly together, Sure freedom sits throned on each proud spirit there. Michael wakes and lets out a loud cry, the Hannons are banging on the wall next door, Mam is telling Dad he's a disgrace and why doesn't he get out of the house altogether. He stands in the middle of the floor with the candle over his head. He pulls a penny from his pocket and waves it to Malachy and me. Your Friday Penny, boys, he says. I want you to jump out of that bed and line up here like two soldiers and promise to die for Ireland and I'll give the two of you the Friday Penny. Malachy sits up in the bed. I don't want it, he says. And I tell him I don't want it, either. Dad stands for a minute, swaying, and puts the penny back in his pocket. He turns toward Mam and she says, You're not sleeping in this bed tonight. He makes his way downstairs with the candle, sleeps on a chair, misses work in the morning, loses the job at the cement factory, and we're back on the dole again. IV The master says it's time to prepare for First Confession and First Communion, to know and remember all the questions and answers in the catechism, to become good Catholics, to know the difference between right and wrong, to die for the Faith if called on. The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk. The master says we're each to bring threepence for the First Communion catechism with the green cover. The catechism has all the questions and answers we have to know by heart before we can receive First Communion. Older boys in the fifth class have the thick Confirmation catechism with the red cover and that costs sixpence. I'd love to be big and important and parade around with the red Confirmation catechism but I don't think I'll live that long the way I'm expected to die for this or that. I want to ask why there are so many big people who haven't died for Ireland or the Faith but I know if you ask a question like that you get you the thump on the head or you're told go out and play. It's very handy to have Mikey Molloy living around the corner from me. He's eleven, he has fits and behind his back we call him Molloy the Fit. People in the lane say the fit is an affliction and now I know what affliction means. Mikey knows everything because he has visions in his fits and he reads books. He's the expert in the lane on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General and he promises, I'll tell you everything, Frankie, when you're eleven like me and you're not so thick and ignorant. It's a good thing he says Frankie so I'll know he's talking to me because he has crossed eyes and you never know who he's looking at. If he's talking to Malachy and I think he's talking to me he might go into a rage and have a fit that will carry him off. He says it's a gift to have crossed eyes because you're like a god looking two ways at once and if you had crossed eyes in the ancient Roman times you had no problem getting a good job. If you look at pictures of Roman emperors you'll see there's always a great hint of crossed eyes. When he's not having the fit he sits on the ground at the top of the lane reading the books his father brings home from the Carnegie Library. His mother says books books books, he's ruining his eyes with the reading, he needs an operation to straighten them but who'll pay for it. She tells him if he keeps on straining his eyes they'll float together till he has one eye in the middle of his head. Ever after his father calls him Cyclops, who is in a Greek story. Nora Molloy knows my mother from the queues at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. She tells Mam that Mikey has more sense than twelve men drinking pints in a pub. He knows the names of all the Popes from St. Peter to Pius the Eleventh. He's only eleven but he's a man, oh, a man indeed. Many a week he saves the family from pure starvation. He borrows a handcart from Aidan Farrell and knocks on doors all over Limerick to see if there are people who want coal or turf delivered, and down the Dock Road he'll go to haul back great bags a hundredweight or more. He'll run messages for old people who can't walk and if they don't have a penny to give him a prayer will do. If he earns a little money he hands it over to his mother, who loves her Mikey. He is her world, her heart's blood, her pulse, and if anything ever happened to him they might as well stick her in the lunatic asylum and throw away the key. Mikey's father, Peter, is a great champion. He wins bets in the pubs by drinking more pints than anyone. All he has to do is go out to the jakes, stick his finger down his throat and bring it all up so that he can start another round. Peter is such a champion he can stand in the jakes and throw up without using his finger. He's such a champion they could chop off his fingers and he'd carry on regardless. He wins all that money but doesn't bring it home. Sometimes he's like my father and drinks the dole itself and that's why Nora Molloy is often carted off to the lunatic asylum demented with worry over her hungry famishing family. She knows as long as you're in the asylum you're safe from the world and its torments, there's nothing you can do, you're protected, and what's the use of worrying. It's well known that all the lunatics in the asylum have to be dragged in but she's the only one that has to be dragged out, back to her five children and the champion of all pint drinkers. You can tell when Nora Molloy is ready for the asylum when you see her children running around white with flour from poll to toe. That happens when Peter drinks the dole money and leaves her desperate and she knows the men will come to take her away. You know she's inside frantic with the baking. She wants to make sure the children won't starve while she's gone and she roams Limerick begging for flour. She goes to priests, nuns, Protestants, Quakers. She goes to Rank's Flour Mills and begs for the sweepings from the floor. She bakes day and night. Peter begs her to stop but she screams, This is what comes of drinking the dole. He tells her the bread will only go stale. There's no use talking to her. Bake bake bake. If she had the money she'd bake all the flour in Limerick and regions beyond. If the men didn't come from the lunatic asylum to take her away she'd bake till she fell to the floor. The children stuff themselves with so much bread people in the lane say they're looking like loaves. Still the bread goes stale and Mikey is so bothered by the waste he talks to a rich woman with a cookbook and she tells him make bread pudding. He boils the hard bread in water and sour milk and throws in a cup of sugar and his brother loves it even if that's all they have the fortnight their mother is in the lunatic asylum. My father says, Do they take her away because she's gone mad baking bread or does she go mad baking bread because they're taking her away? Nora comes home calm as if she had been at the seaside. She always says, Where's Mikey? Is he alive? She worries over Mikey because he's not a proper Catholic and if he had a fit and died who knows where he might wind up in the next life. He's not a proper Catholic because he could never receive his First Communion for fear of getting anything on his tongue that might cause a fit and choke him. The master tried over and over with bits of the Limerick Leader but Mikey kept spitting them out till the master got into a state and sent him to the priest, who wrote to the bishop, who said, Don't bother me, handle it yourself. The master sent a note home saying Mikey was to practice receiving Communion with his father or mother but even they couldn't get him to swallow a piece of the Limerick Leader in the shape of a wafer. They even tried a piece of bread shaped like the wafer with bread and jam and it was no use. The priest tells Mrs. Molloy not to worry. God moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform and surely He has a special purpose for Mikey, fits and all. She says, Isn't it remarkable he can swally all kinds of sweets and buns but if he has to swally the body of Our Lord he goes into a fit? Isn't that remarkable? She worries Mikey might have the fit and die and go to hell if he has any class of a sin on his soul though everyone knows he's an angel out of heaven. Mikey tells her God is not going to afflict you with the fit and then boot you into hell on top of it. What kind of a God would do a thing like that? Are you sure, Mikey? I am. I read it in a book. He sits under the lamppost at the top of the lane and laughs over his First Communion day, which was all a cod. He couldn't swallow the wafer but did that stop his mother from parading him around Limerick in his little black suit for The Collection? She said to Mikey, Well, I'm not lying so I'm not. I'm only saying to the neighbors, Here's Mikey in his First Communion suit. That's all I'm saying, mind you. Here's Mikey. If they think you swallied your First Communion who am I to contradict them and disappoint them? Mikey's father said, Don't worry, Cyclops. You have loads of time. Jesus didn't become a proper Catholic till he took the bread and wine at the Last Supper and He was thirty-three years of age. Nora Molloy said, Will you stop calling him Cyclops? He has two eyes in his head and he's not a Greek. But Mikey's father, champion of all pint drinkers, is like my uncle Pa Keating, he doesn't give a fiddler's fart what the world says and that's the way I'd like to be myself. Mikey tells me the best thing about First Communion is The Collection. Your mother has to get you a new suit somehow so she can show you off to the neighbors and relations and they give you sweets and money and you can go to the Lyric Cinema to see Charlie Chaplin. What about James Cagney? Never mind James Cagney. Lots of blather. Charlie Chaplin is your only man. But you have to be with your mother on The Collection. The grown-up people of Limerick are not going to be handing out money to every little Tom Dick and Mick with a First Communion suit that doesn't have his mother with him. Mikey got over five shillings on his First Communion day and ate so many sweets and buns he threw up in the Lyric Cinema and Frank Goggin, the ticket man, kicked him out. He says he didn't care because he had money left over and went to the Savoy Cinema the same day for a pirate film and ate Cadbury chocolate and drank lemonade till his stomach stuck out a mile. He can't wait for Confirmation day because you're older, there's another collection and that brings more money than First Communion. He'll go to the cinema the rest of his life, sit next to girls from lanes and do dirty things like an expert. He loves his mother but he'll never get married for fear he might have a wife in and out of the lunatic asylum. What's the use of getting married when you can sit in cinemas and do dirty things with girls from lanes who don't care what they do because they already did it with their brothers. If you don't get married you won't have any children at home bawling for tea and bread and gasping with the fit and looking in every direction with their eyes. When he's older he'll go to the pub like his father, drink pints galore, stick the finger down the throat to bring it all up, drink more pints, win the bets and bring the money home to his mother to keep her from going demented. He says he's not a proper Catholic which means he's doomed so he can do anything he bloody well likes. He says, I'll tell you more when you grow up, Frankie. You're too young now and you don't know your arse from your elbow. The master, Mr. Benson, is very old. He roars and spits all over us every day. The boys in the front row hope he has no diseases for it's the spit that carries all the diseases and he might be spreading consumption right and left. He tells us we have to know the catechism backwards, forwards and sideways. We have to know the Ten Commandments, the Seven Virtues, Divine and Moral, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Deadly Sins. We have to know by heart all the prayers, the Hail Mary, the Our Father, the Confiteor, the Apostles' Creed, the Act of Contrition, the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. We have to know them in Irish and English and if we forget an Irish word and use English he goes into a rage and goes at us with the stick. If he had his way we'd be learning our religion in Latin, the language of the saints who communed intimately with God and His Holy Mother, the language of the early Christians, who huddled in the catacombs and went forth to die on rack and sword, who expired in the foaming jaws of the ravenous lion. Irish is fine for patriots, English for traitors and informers, but it's the Latin that gains us entrance to heaven itself. It's the Latin the martyrs prayed in when the barbarians pulled out their nails and cut their skin off inch by inch. He tells us we're a disgrace to Ireland and her long sad history, that we'd be better off in Africa praying to bush or tree. He tells us we're hopeless, the worst class he ever had for First Communion but as sure as God made little apples he'll make Catholics of us, he'll beat the idler out of us and the Sanctifying Grace into us. Brendan Quigley raises his hand. We call him Question Quigley because he's always asking questions. He can't help himself. Sir, he says, what's Sanctifying Grace? The master rolls his eyes to heaven. He's going to kill Quigley. Instead he barks at him, Never mind what's Sanctifying Grace, Quigley. That's none of your business. You're here to learn the catechism and do what you're told. You're not here to be asking questions. There are too many people wandering the world asking questions and that's what has us in the state we're in and if I find any boy in this class asking questions I won't be responsible for what happens. Do you hear me, Quigley? I do. I do what? I do, sir. He goes on with his speech, There are boys in this class who will never know the Sanctifying Grace. And why? Because of the greed. I have heard them abroad in the schoolyard talking about First Communion day, the happiest day of your life. Are they talking about receiving the body and blood of Our Lord? Oh, no. Those greedy little blaguards are talking about the money they'll get, The Collection. They'll go from house to house in their little suits like beggars for The Collection. And will they take any of that money and send it to the little black babies in Africa? Will they think of those little pagans doomed forever for lack of baptism and knowledge of the True Faith? Little black babies denied knowledge of the Mystical Body of Christ? Limbo is packed with little black babies flying around and crying for their mothers because they'll never be admitted to the ineffable presence of Our Lord and the glorious company of saints, martyrs, virgins. Oh, no. It's off to the cinemas, our First Communion boys run to wallow in the filth spewed across the world by the devil's henchmen in Hollywood. Isn't that right, McCourt? 'Tis, sir. Question Quigley raises his hand again. There are looks around the room and we wonder if it's suicide he's after. What's henchmen, sir? The master's face goes white, then red. His mouth tightens and opens and spit flies everywhere. He walks to Question and drags him from his seat. He snorts and stutters and his spit flies around the room. He flogs Question across the shoulders, the bottom, the legs. He grabs him by the collar and drags him to the front of the room. Look at this specimen, he roars. Question is shaking and crying. I'm sorry, sir. The master mocks him. I'm sorry, sir. What are you sorry for? I'm sorry I asked the question. I'll never ask a question again, sir. The day you do, Quigley, will be the day you wish God would take you to His bosom. What will you wish, Quigley? That God will take me to His bosom, sir. Go back to your seat, you omadhaun, you poltroon, you thing from the far dark corner of a bog. He sits down with the stick before him on the desk. He tells Question to stop the whimpering and be a man. If he hears a single boy in this class asking foolish questions or talking about The Collection again he'll flog that boy till the blood spurts. what? What will I do, boys? Flog the boy, sir. Till? Till the blood spurts, sir. Now, Clohessy, what is the Sixth Commandment? Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not commit adultery, sir. And what is adultery, Clohessy? Impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, sir. Good, Clohessy. You're a good boy. You may be slow and forgetful in the sir department and you may not have a shoe to your foot but you're powerful with the Sixth Commandment and that will keep you pure. Paddy Clohessy has no shoe to his foot, his mother shaves his head to keep the lice away, his eyes are red, his nose always snotty. The sores on his kneecaps never heal because he picks at the scabs and puts them in his mouth. His clothes are rags he has to share with his six brothers and a sister and when he comes to school with a bloody nose or a black eye you know he had a fight over the clothes that morning. He hates school. He's seven going on eight, the biggest and oldest boy in the class, and he can't wait to grow up and be fourteen so that he can run away and pass for seventeen and join the English army and go to India where it's nice and warm and he'll live in a tent with a dark girl with the red dot on her forehead and he'll be lying there eating figs, that's what they eat in India, figs, and she'll cook the curry day and night and plonk on a ukulele and when he has enough money he'll send for the whole family and they'll all live in the tent especially his poor father who's at home coughing up great gobs of blood because of the consumption. When my mother sees Paddy on the street she says, Wisha, look at that poor child. He's a skeleton with rags and if they were making a film about the famine he'd surely be put in the middle of it. I think Paddy likes me because of the raisin and I feel a bit guilty because I wasn't that generous in the first place. The master, Mr. Benson, said the government was going to give us the free lunch so we wouldn't have to be going home in the freezing weather. He led us down to a cold room in the dungeons of Leamy's School where the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, was handing out the half pint of milk and the raisin bun. The milk was frozen in the bottles and we had to melt it between our thighs. The boys joked and said the bottles would freeze our things off and the master roared, Any more of that talk and I'll warm the bottles on the backs of yeer heads. We all searched our raisin buns for a raisin but Nellie said they must have forgotten to put them in and she'd inquire from the man who delivered. We searched again every day till at last I found a raisin in my bun and held it up. The boys started grousing and said they wanted a raisin and Nellie said it wasn't her fault. She'd ask the man again. Now the boys were begging me for the raisin and offering me everything, a slug of their milk, a pencil, a comic book. Toby Mackey said I could have his sister and Mr. Benson heard him and took him out to the hallway and knocked him around till he howled. I wanted the raisin for myself but I saw Paddy Clohessy standing in the corner with no shoes and the room was freezing and he was shivering like a dog that had been kicked and I always felt sad over kicked dogs so I walked over and gave Paddy the raisin because I didn't know what else to do and all the boys yelled that I was a fool and a feckin' eejit and I'd regret the day and after I handed the raisin to Paddy I longed for it but it was too late now because he pushed it right into his mouth and gulped it and looked at me and said nothing and I said in my head what kind of an eejit are you to be giving away your raisin. Mr. Benson gave me a look and said nothing and Nellie Ahearn said, You're a great oul'Yankee, Frankie. The priest will come soon to examine us on the catechism and everything else. The master himself has to show us how to receive Holy Communion. He tells us gather round him. He fills his hat with the Limerick Leader torn into little bits. He gives Paddy Clohessy the hat, kneels on the floor, tells Paddy to take one bit of paper and place it on his tongue. He shows us how to stick out the tongue, receive the bit of paper, hold it a moment, draw in the tongue, fold your hands in prayer, look toward heaven, close your eyes in adoration, wait for the paper to melt in your mouth, swallow it, and thank God for the gift, the Sanctifying Grace wafting in on the odor of sanctity. When he sticks out his tongue we have to hold in the laugh because we never saw a big purple tongue before. He opens his eyes to catch the boys who are giggling but he can't say anything because he still has God on his tongue and it's a holy moment. He gets off his knees and tells us kneel around the classroom for the Holy Communion practice. He goes around the room placing bits of paper on our tongues and mumbling in Latin. Some boys giggle and he roars at them that if the giggling doesn't stop it's not Holy Communion they'll be getting but the Last Rites and what is that sacrament called, McCourt? Extreme Unction, sir. That's right, McCourt. Not bad for a Yank from the sinful shores of Amerikay. He tells us we have to be careful to stick out our tongues far enough so that the Communion wafer won't fall to the floor. He says, That's the worst thing that can happen to a priest. If the wafer slides off your tongue that poor priest has to get down on his two knees, pick it up with his own tongue and lick the floor around it in case it bounced from one spot to another. The priest could get a splinter that would make his tongue swell to the size of a turnip and that's enough to choke you and kill you entirely. He tells us that next to a relic of the True Cross the Communion wafer is the holiest thing in the world and our First Communion is the holiest moment in our lives. Talking about First Communion makes the master all excited. He paces back and forth, waves his stick, tells us we must never forget that the moment the Holy Communion is placed on our tongues we become members of that most glorious congregation, the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church, that for two thousand years men, women and children have died for the Faith, that the Irish have nothing to be ashamed of in the martyr department. Haven't we provided martyrs galore? Haven't we bared our necks to the Protestant ax? Haven't we mounted the scaffold, singing, as if embarking on a picnic, haven't we, boys? We have, sir. What have we done, boys? Bared our necks to the Protestant ax, sir. And? Mounted the scaffold singing, sir. As if? Embarking on a picnic, sir. He says that, perhaps, in this class there is a future priest or a martyr for the Faith, though he doubts it very much for we are the laziest gang of ignoramuses it has ever been his misfortune to teach. But it takes all kinds, he says, and surely God had some purpose when He sent the likes of ye to infest this earth. Surely God had a purpose when among us He sent Clohessy with no shoes, Quigley with his damnable questions and McCourt heavy with sin from America. And remember this, boys, God did not send His only begotten Son to hang on the cross so that ye can go around on yeer First Communion day with the paws clutching for The Collection. Our Lord died so that ye might be redeemed. It is enough to receive the gift of Faith. Are ye listening to me? We are, sir. And what's enough? The gift of Faith, sir. Good. Go home. At night three of us sit under the light pole at the top of the lane reading, Mikey, Malachy and I. The Molloys are like us with their father drinking the dole money or the wages and leaving no money for candles or paraffin oil for the lamp. Mikey reads books and the rest of us read comic books. His father, Peter, brings books from the Carnegie Library so that he'll have something to do when he's not drinking pints or when he's looking after the family anytime Mrs. Molloy is in the lunatic asylum. He lets Mikey read any book he likes and now Mikey is reading this book about Cuchulain and talking as if he knows everything about him. I want to tell him I knew all about Cuchulain when I was three going on four, that I saw Cuchulain in Dublin, that Cuchulain thinks nothing of dropping into my dreams. I want to tell him stop talking about Cuchulain, he's mine, he was mine years ago when I was young, but I can't because Mikey reads us a story I never heard of before, a dirty story about Cuchulain which I can never tell my father or mother, the story of how Emer became Cuchulain's wife. Cuchulain was getting to be an old man of twenty-one. He was lonely and wanted to get married, which made him weak, says Mikey, and got him killed in the end. All the women in Ireland were mad about Cuchulain and they wanted to marry him. He said that would be grand, he wouldn't mind marrying all the women of Ireland. If he could fight all the men of Ireland why couldn't he marry all the women? But the King, Conor MacNessa, said, That's all very well for you, Cu, but the men of Ireland don't want to be lonely in the far reaches of the night. The King decided there would have to be a contest to see who would marry Cuchulain and it would be a pissing contest. All the women of Ireland assembled on the plains of Muirthemne to see who could piss the longest and it was Emer. She was the champion woman pisser of Ireland and married Cuchulain and that's why to this day she is called Great Bladdered Emer. Mikey and Malachy laugh over this story though I don't think Malachy understands it. He's young and far from his First Communion and he's only laughing over the piss word. Then Mikey tells me I've committed a sin by listening to a story that has that word in it and when I go to my First Confession I'll have to tell the priest. Malachy says, That's right. Piss is a bad word and you have to tell the priest because 'tis a sin word. I don't know what to do. How can I go to the priest and tell him this terrible thing in my First Confession? All the boys know what sins they're going to tell so that they'll get the First Communion and make The Collection and go to see James Cagney and eat sweets and cakes at the Lyric Cinema. The master helped us with our sins and everyone has the same sins. I hit my brother. I told a lie. I stole a penny from my mother's purse. I disobeyed my parents, I ate a sausage on Friday. But now I have a sin no one else has and the priest is going to be shocked and drag me out of the confession box into the aisle and out into the street where everyone will know I listened to a story about Cuchulain's wife being the champion woman pisser in all Ireland. I'll never be able to make my First Communion and mothers will hold their small children up and point at me and say, Look at him. He's like Mikey Molloy, never made his First Communion, wandering around in a state of sin, never made The Collection, never saw James Cagney. I'm sorry I ever heard of First Communion and The Collection. I'm sick and I don't want any tea or bread or anything. Mam tells Dad it's a strange thing when a child won't have his bread and tea and Dad says, Och, he's just nervous over the First Communion. I want to go over to him and sit on his lap and tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me but I'm too big to be sitting on laps and if I did Malachy would go out in the lane and tell everyone I was a big baby. I'd like to tell my troubles to the Angel on the Seventh Step but he's busy bringing babies to mothers all over the world. Still, I'll ask Dad. Dad, does the Angel on the Seventh Step have other jobs besides bringing babies? He does. Would the Angel on the Seventh Step tell you what to do if you didn't know what to do? Och, he would, son, he would. That's the job of an angel, even the one on the seventh step. Dad goes for a long walk, Mam takes Michael and goes to see Grandma, Malachy plays in the lane, and I have the house to myself so that I can sit on the seventh step and talk to the angel. I know he's there because the seventh step feels warmer than the other steps and there's a light in my head. I tell him my troubles and I hear a voice. Fear not, says the voice. He's talking backward and I tell him I don't know what he's talking about. Do not fear, says the voice. Tell the priest your sin and you'll be forgiven. Next morning I'm up early and drinking tea with Dad and telling him about the Angel on the Seventh Step. He places his hand on my forehead to see if I'm feeling all right. He asks if I'm sure I had a light in my head and heard a voice and what did the voice say? I tell him the voice said Fear not and that means Do not fear. Dad tells me the angel is right, I shouldn't be afraid, and I tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me. I tell him all about Great Bladdered Emer and I even use the piss word because the angel said, Fear not. Dad puts down his jam jar of tea and pats the back of my hand. Och, och, och, he says, and I wonder if he's going demented like Mrs. Molloy, in and out of the lunatic asylum, but he says, Is that what you were worried about last night? I tell him it is and he says it's not a sin and I don't have to tell the priest. But the Angel on the Seventh Step said I should. All right. Tell the priest if you like but the Angel on the Seventh Step said that only because you didn't tell me first. Isn't it better to be able to tell your father your troubles rather than an angel who is a light and a voice in your head? 'Tis, Dad. The day before First Communion the master leads us to St. Joseph's Church for First Confession. We march in pairs and if we so much as move a lip on the streets of Limerick he'll kill us on the spot and send us to hell bloated with sin. That doesn't stop the bragging about the big sins. Willie Harold is whispering about his big sin, that he looked at his sister's naked body. Paddy Hartigan says he stole ten shillings from his aunt's purse and made himself sick with ice cream and chips. Question Quigley says he ran away from home and spent half the night in a ditch with four goats. I try to tell them about Cuchulain and Emer but the master catches me talking and gives me a thump on the head. We kneel in the pews by the confession box and I wonder if my Emer sin is as bad as looking at your sister's naked body because I know now that some things in the world are worse than others. That's why they have different sins, the sacrilege, the mortal sin, the venial sin. Then the masters and grown-up people in general talk about the unforgivable sin, which is a great mystery. No one knows what it is and you wonder how you can know if you've committed it if you don't know what it is. If I tell a priest about Great Bladdered Emer and the pissing contest he might say that's the unforgivable sin and kick me out of the confession box and I'll be disgraced all over Limerick and doomed to hell tormented forever by devils who have nothing else to do but stab me with hot pitchforks till I'm worn out. I try to listen to Willie's confession when he goes in but all I can hear is a hissing from the priest and when Willie comes out he's crying. It's my turn. The confession box is dark and there's a big crucifix hanging over my head. I can hear a boy mumbling his confession on the other side. I wonder if there's any use trying to talk to the Angel on the Seventh Step. I know he's not supposed to be hanging around confession boxes but I feel the light in my head and the voice is telling me, Fear not. The panel slides back before my face and the priest says, Yes, my child? Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my First Confession. Yes, my child, and what sins have you committed? I told a lie. I hit my brother. I took a penny from my mother's purse. I said a curse. Yes, my child. Anything else? I, I listened to a story about Cuchulain and Emer. Surely that's not a sin, my child. After all we are assured by certain writers that Cuchulain turned Catholic in his last moments as did his King, Conor MacNessa. 'Tis about Emer, Father, and how she married him. How was that, my child? She won him in a pissing contest. There is heavy breathing. The priest has his hand over his mouth and he's making choking sounds and talking to himself, Mother o' God. Who, who told you that story, my child? Mikey Molloy, Father. And where did he hear it? He read it in a book, Father. Ah, a book. Books can be dangerous for children, my child. Turn your mind from those silly stories and think of the lives of the saints. Think of St. Joseph, the Little Flower, the sweet and gentle St. Francis of Assisi, who loved the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. Will you do that, my child? I will, Father. Are there any other sins, my child? No, Father. For your penance say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, and say a special prayer for me. I will. Father, was that the worst sin? What do you mean? Am I the worst of all the boys, Father? No, my child, you have a long way to go. Now say an Act of Contrition and remember Our Lord watches you every minute. God bless you, my child. First Communion day is the happiest day of your life because of The Collection and James Cagney at the Lyric Cinema. The night before I was so excited I couldn't sleep till dawn. I'd still be sleeping if my grandmother hadn't come banging at the door. Get up! Get up! Get that child outa the bed. Happiest day of his life an' him snorin' above in the bed. I ran to the kitchen. Take off that shirt, she said. I took off the shirt and she pushed me into a tin tub of icy cold water. My mother scrubbed me, my grandmother scrubbed me. I was raw, I was red. They dried me. They dressed me in my black velvet First Communion suit with the white frilly shirt, the short pants, the white stockings, the black patent leather shoes. Around my arm they tied a white satin bow and on my lapel they pinned the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a picture of the Sacred Heart, with blood dripping from it, flames erupting all around it and on top a nasty looking crown of thorns. Come here till I comb your hair, said Grandma. Look at that mop, it won't lie down. You didn't get that hair from my side of the family. That's that North of Ireland hair you got from your father. That's the kind of hair you see on Presbyterians. If your mother had married a proper decent Limerickman you wouldn't have this standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair. She spat twice on my head. Grandma, will you please stop spitting on my head. If you have anything to say, shut up. A little spit won't kill you. Come on, we'll be late for the Mass. We ran to the church. My mother panted along behind with Michael in her arms. We arrived at the church just in time to see the last of the boys leaving the altar rail where the priest stood with the chalice and the host, glaring at me. Then he placed on my tongue the wafer, the body and blood of Jesus. At last, at last. It's on my tongue. I draw it back. It stuck. I had God glued to the roof of my mouth. I could hear the master's voice, Don't let that host touch your teeth for if you bite God in two you'll roast in hell for eternity. I tried to get God down with my tongue but the priest hissed at me, Stop that clucking and get back to your seat. God was good. He melted and I swallowed Him and now, at last, I was a member of the True Church, an official sinner. When the Mass ended there they were at the door of the church, my mother with Michael in her arms, my grandmother. They each hugged me to their bosoms. They each told me it was the happiest day of my life. They each cried all over my head and after my grandmother's contribution that morning my head was a swamp. Mam, can I go now and make The Collection? She said, After you have a little breakfast. No, said Grandma. You're not making no collection till you've had a proper First Communion breakfast at my house. Come on. We followed her. She banged pots and rattled pans and complained that the whole world expected her to be at their beck and call. I ate the egg, I ate the sausage, and when I reached for more sugar for my tea she slapped my hand away. Go aisy with that sugar. Is it a millionaire you think I am? An American? Is it bedecked in glitterin' jewelry you think I am? Smothered in fancy furs? The food churned in my stomach. I gagged. I ran to her backyard and threw it all up. Out she came. Look at what he did. Thrun up his First Communion breakfast. Thrun up the body and blood of Jesus. I have God in me backyard. What am I goin' to do? I'll take him to the Jesuits for they know the sins of the Pope himself. She dragged me through the streets of Limerick. She told the neighbors and passing strangers about God in her backyard. She pushed me into the confession box. In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's a day since my last confession. A day? And what sins have you committed in a day, my child? I overslept. I nearly missed my First Communion. My grandmother said I have standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair. I threw up my First Communion breakfast. Now Grandma says she has God in her backyard and what should she do. The priest is like the First Confession priest. He has the heavy breathing and the choking sounds. Ah... ah... tell your grandmother to wash God away with a little water and for your penance say one Hail Mary and one Our Father. Say a prayer for me and God bless you, my child. Grandma and Mam were waiting close to the confession box. Grandma said, Were you telling jokes to that priest in the confession box? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you were telling jokes to Jesuits I'll tear the bloody kidneys outa you. Now what did he say about God in me backyard? He said wash Him away with a little water, Grandma. Holy water or ordinary water? He didn't say, Grandma. Well, go back and ask him. But, Grandma... She pushed me back into the confessional. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a minute since my last confession. A minute! Are you the boy that was just here? I am, Father. What is it now? My grandma says, Holy water or ordinary water? Ordinary water, and tell your grandmother not to be bothering me again. I told her, Ordinary water, Grandma, and he said don't be bothering him again. Don't be bothering him again. That bloody ignorant bogtrotter. I asked Mam, Can I go now and make The Collection? I want to see James Cagney. Grandma said, You can forget about The Collection and James Cagney because you're not a proper Catholic the way you left God on the ground. Come on, go home. Mam said, Wait a minute. That's my son. That's my son on his First Communion day. He's going to see James Cagney. No he's not. Yes he is. Grandma said, Take him then to James Cagney and see if that will save his Presbyterian North of Ireland American soul. Go ahead. She pulled her shawl around her and walked away. Mam said, God, it's getting very late for The Collection and you'll never see James Cagney. We'll go to the Lyric Cinema and see if they'll let you in anyway in your First Communion suit. We met Mikey Molloy on Barrington Street. He asked if I was going to the Lyric and I said I was trying. Trying? he said. You don't have money? I was ashamed to say no but I had to and he said, That's all right. I'll get you in. I'll create a diversion. What's a diversion? I have the money to go and when I get in I'll pretend to have the fit and the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when I let out the big scream. I'll be watching the door and when I see you in I'll have a miraculous recovery. That's a diversion. That's what I do to get my brothers in all the time. Mam said, Oh, I don't know about that, Mikey. Wouldn't that be a sin and surely you wouldn't want Frank to commit a sin on his First Communion day. Mikey said if there was a sin it would be on his soul and he wasn't a proper Catholic anyway so it didn't matter. He let out his scream and I slipped in and sat next to Question Quigley and the ticket man, Frank Goggin, was so worried over Mikey he never noticed. It was a thrilling film but sad in the end because James Cagney was a public enemy and when they shot him they wrapped him in bandages and threw him in the door, shocking his poor old Irish mother, and that was the end of my First Communion day. V Grandma won't talk to Mam anymore because of what I did with God in her backyard. Mam doesn't talk to her sister, Aunt Aggie, or her brother Uncle Tom. Dad doesn't talk to anyone in Mam's family and they don't talk to him because he's from the North and he has the odd manner. No one talks to Uncle Tom's wife, Jane, because she's from Galway and she has the look of a Spaniard. Everyone talks to Mam's brother Uncle Pat, because he was dropped on his head, he's simple, and he sells newspapers. Everyone calls him The Abbot or Ab Sheehan and no one knows why. Everyone talks to Uncle Pa Keating because he was gassed in the war and married Aunt Aggie and if they didn't talk to him he wouldn't give a fiddler's fart anyway and that's why the men in South's pub call him a gas man. That's the way I'd like to be in the world, a gas man, not giving a fiddler's fart, and that's what I tell the Angel on the Seventh Step till I remember you're not supposed to say fart in the presence of an angel. Uncle Tom and Galway Jane have children but we're not supposed to talk to them because our parents are not talking. They have a son and daughter, Gerry and Peggy, and Mam will yell at us for talking to them but we don't know how not to talk to our cousins. People in families in the lanes of Limerick have their ways of not talking to each other and it takes years of practice. There are people who don't talk to each other because their fathers were on opposite sides in the Civil War in 1922. If a man goes off and joins the English army his family might as well move to another part of Limerick where there are families with men in the English army. If anyone in your family was the least way friendly to the English in the last eight hundred years it will be brought up and thrown in your face and you might as well move to Dublin where no one cares. There are families that are ashamed of themselves because their forefathers gave up their religion for the sake of a bowl of Protestant soup during the Famine and those families are known ever after as soupers. It's a terrible thing to be a souper because you're doomed forever to the souper part of hell. It's even worse to be an informer. The master at school said that everytime the Irish were about to demolish the English in a fair fight a filthy informer betrayed them. A man who's discovered to be an informer deserves to be hanged or, even worse, to have no one talk to him for if no one talks to you you're better off hanging at the end of a rope. In every lane there's always someone not talking to someone or everyone not talking to someone or someone not talking to everyone. You can always tell when people are not talking by the way they pass each other. The women hoist their noses, tighten their mouths and turn their faces away. If the woman is wearing a shawl she takes a corner and flings it over her shoulder as if to say, One word or look from you, you ma faced bitch, and I'll tear the countenance from the front of your head. It's bad when Grandma won't talk to us because we can't run to her when we need to borrow sugar or tea or milk. There's no use going to Aunt Aggie. She'll only bite your head off. Go home, she'll say, and tell your father to get off his northern arse and get a job like the decent men of Limerick. They say she's always angry because she has red hair or she has red hair because she's always angry. Mam is friendly with Bridey Hannon, who lives next door with her mother and father. Mam and Bridey talk all the time. When my father goes for his long walk Bridey comes in and she and Mam sit by the fire drinking tea and smoking cigarettes. If Mam has nothing in the house Bridey brings tea, sugar and milk. Sometimes they use the same tea leaves over and over and Mam says the tea is stewed, coddled and boiled. Mam and Bridey sit so close to the fire their shins turn red and purple and blue. They talk for hours and they whisper and laugh over secret things. We're not supposed to hear the secret things so we're told go out and play. I often sit on the seventh step listening and they have no notion I'm there. It might be lashing rain out but Mam says, Rain or no, out you go, and she'll tell us, If you see your father coming, run in and tell me. Mam says to Bridey, Did you ever hear that poem that someone must have made up about me and him? What poem, Angela? 'Tis called ""The Man from the North. "" I got this poem from Minnie MacAdorey in America. I never heard that poem. Say it for me. Mam says the poem but she laughs all through it and I don't know why, He came from the North so his words were few But his voice was kind and his heart was true. And I knew by his eyes that no guile had he, So I married my man from the North Country. Oh, Garryowen may be more gay Than this quiet man from beside Lough Neagh And I know that the sun shines softly down On the river that runs through my native town. But there's not-and I say it with joy and with pride A better man in all Munster wide And Limerick town has no happier hearth Than mine has been with my man from the North. I wish that in Limerick they only knew The kind kind neighbors I came unto. Small hate or scorn would there ever be Between the South and the North Country. She always repeats the third verse and laughs so hard she's crying and I don't know why. She goes into hysterics when she says, And Limerick town has no happier hearth Than mine has been with my man from the North. If he comes back early and sees Bridey in the kitchen the man from the North says, Gossip, gossip, gossip, and stands there with his cap on till she leaves. Bridey's mother and other people in our lane and lanes beyond will come to the door to ask Dad if he'll write a letter to the government or a relation in a distant place. He sits at the table with his pen and bottle of ink and when the people tell him what to write he says, Och, no, that's not what you want to say, and he writes what he feels like writing. The people tell him that's what they wanted to say in the first place, that he has a lovely way with the English language and a fine fist for the writing. They offer him sixpence for his trouble but he waves it away and they hand it to Mam because he's too grand to be taking sixpence. When the people leave he takes the sixpence and sends me to Kathleen O'Connell's shop for cigarettes. Grandma sleeps in a big bed upstairs with a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus over her head and a statue of the Sacred Heart on the mantel piece. She wants to switch from gaslight to electric light someday so that she'll have a little red light under the statue forever. Her devotion to the Sacred Heart is known up and down the lane and in lanes beyond. Uncle Pat sleeps in a small bed in a corner of the same room where Grandma can make sure he comes in at a proper hour and kneels by the bed to say his prayers. He might have been dropped on his head, he may not know how to read and write, he may drink one pint too many, but there's no excuse for not saying his prayers before he goes to sleep. Uncle Pat tells Grandma he met a man who is looking for a place to stay that will let him wash himself morning and night and give him two meals a day, dinner and tea. His name is Bill Galvin and he has a good job down at the lime kiln. He's covered all the time with white lime dust but surely that's better than coal dust. Grandma will have to give up her bed and move into the small room. She'll take the Sacred Heart picture and leave the statue to watch over the two men. Besides, she has no place for a statue in her little room. Bill Galvin comes after work to see the place. He's small, all white, and he snuffles like a dog. He asks Grandma if she'd mind taking down that statue because he's a Protestant and he wouldn't be able to sleep. Grandma barks at Uncle Pat for not telling her he was dragging a Protestant into the house. Jesus, she says, there will be gossip up and down the lane and beyond. Uncle Pat says he didn't know Bill Galvin was a Protestant. You could never tell by looking at him especially the way he's covered with lime. He looks like an ordinary Catholic and you'd never imagine a Protestant would be shoveling lime. Bill Galvin says his poor wife that just died was a Catholic and she had the walls covered with pictures of the Sacred Heart and the Virgin Mary showing their hearts. He's not against the Sacred Heart himself, it's just that seeing the statue will remind him of his poor wife and give him the heartache. Grandma says, Ah, God help us, why didn't you tell me that in the first place? Sure I can put the statue on the windowsill in my room and your heart won't be tormented at the sight of it. Every morning Grandma cooks Bill's dinner and takes it to him at the lime kiln. Mam wonders why he can't take it with him in the morning and Grandma says, Do you expect me to get up at dawn and boil cabbage and pig's toes for his lordship to take in his dinner can? Mam tells her, In another week school will be over and if you give Frank sixpence a week he'll surely be glad to take Bill Galvin his dinner. I don't want to go to Grandma's every day. I don't want to take Bill Galvin his dinner all the way down the Dock Road, but Mam says that's sixpence we could use and if I don't do it I'm going nowhere else. You're staying in the house, she says. You're not playing with your pals. Grandma warns me to take the dinner can directly and not be meandering, looking this way and that, kicking canisters and ruining the toes of my shoes. This dinner is hot and that's the way Bill Galvin wants it. There's a lovely smell from the dinner can, boiled bacon and cabbage and two big floury white potatoes. Surely he won't notice if I try half a potato. He won't complain to Grandma because he hardly ever talks outside of a snuffle or two. It's better if I eat the other half potato so that he won't be asking why he got a half. I might as well try the bacon and cabbage too and if I eat the other potato he'll surely think she didn't send one at all. The second potato melts in my mouth and I'll have to try another bit of cabbage, another morsel of bacon. There isn't much left now and he'll be very suspicious so I might as well finish off the rest. What am I going to do now? Grandma will destroy me, Mam will keep me in for a year. Bill Galvin will bury me in lime. I'll tell him I was attacked by a dog on the Dock Road and he ate the whole dinner and I'm lucky I escaped without being eaten myself. Oh, is that so? says Bill Galvin. And what's that bit of cabbage hanging on your gansey? Did the dog lick you wit his cabbagey gob? Go home and tell your grandmother you ate me whole dinner and I'm falling down with the hunger here in this lime kiln. She'll kill me. Tell her don't kill you till she sends me some class of a dinner and if you don't go to her now and get me a dinner I'll kill you and throw your body into the lime there and there won't be much left for your mother to moan over. Grandma says, What are you doin' back with that can? He could bring that back by himself. He wants more dinner. What do you mean more dinner? Jesus above, is it a hole he has in his leg? He's falling down with the hunger below in the lime kiln. Is it coddin' me you are? He says send him any class of a dinner. I will not. I sent him his dinner. He didn't get it. He didn't? Why not? I ate it. What? I was hungry and I tasted it and I couldn't stop. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph. She gives me a clout on the head that brings tears to my eyes. She screams at me like a banshee and jumps around the kitchen and threatens to drag me to the priest, the bishop, the Pope himself if he lived around the corner. She cuts bread and waves the knife at me and makes sandwiches of brawn and cold potatoes. Take these sandwiches to Bill Galvin and if you even look cross- eyed at them I'll skin your hide. Of course she runs to Mam and they agree the only way I can make up for my terrible sin is to deliver Bill Galvin's dinner for a fortnight without pay. I'm to bring back the can every day and that means I have to sit watching him stuff the food into his gob and he's not one that would ever ask you if you had a mouth in your head. Every day I take the can back Grandma makes me kneel to the statue of the Sacred Heart and tell Him I'm sorry and all this over Bill Galvin, a Protestant. Mam says, I'm a martyr for the fags and so is your father. There may be a lack of tea or bread in the house but Mam and Dad always manage to get the fags, the Wild Woodbines. They have to have the Woodbines in the morning and anytime they drink tea. They tell us every day we should never smoke, it's bad for your lungs, it's bad for your chest, it stunts your growth, and they sit by the fire puffing away. Mam says, If 'tis a thing I ever see you with a fag in your gob I'll break your face. They tell us the cigarettes rot your teeth and you can see they're not lying. The teeth turn brown and black in their heads and fall out one by one. Dad says he has holes in his teeth big enough for a sparrow to raise a family. He has a few left but he gets them pulled at the clinic and applies for a false set. When he comes home with the new teeth he shows his big new white smile that makes him look like an American and whenever he tells us a ghost story by the fire he pushes the lower teeth up beyond his lip to his nose and frightens the life out of us. Mam's teeth are so bad she has to go to Barrington's Hospital to have them all pulled at the same time and when she comes home she's holding at her mouth a rag bright with blood. She has to sit up all night by the fire because you can't lie down when your gums are pumping blood or you'll choke in your sleep. She says she'll give up smoking entirely when this bleeding stops but she needs one puff of a fag this minute for the comfort that's in it. She tells Malachy go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and ask her would she ever let her have five Woodbines till Dad collects the dole on Thursday. If anyone can get the fags out of Kathleen, Malachy can. Mam says he has the charm, and she tells me, There's no use sending you with your long puss and your father's odd manner. When the bleeding stops and Mam's gums heal she goes to the clinic for her false teeth. She says she'll give up the smoking when her new teeth are in but she never does. The new teeth rub on her gums and make them sore and the smoke of the Woodbines eases them. She and Dad sit by the fire when we have one and smoke their cigarettes and when they talk their teeth clack. They try to stop the clacking by moving their jaws back and forth but that only makes it worse and they curse the dentists and the people above in Dublin who made the teeth and while they curse they clack. Dad claims these teeth were made for rich people in Dublin and didn't fit so they were passed on to the poor of Limerick who don't care because you don't have much to chew when you're poor anyway and you're grateful you have any class of a tooth in your head. If they talk too long their gums get sore and the teeth have to come out. Then they sit talking by the fire with their faces collapsed. Every night they leave the teeth in the kitchen in jam jars filled with water. Malachy wants to know why and Dad tells him it cleans them. Mam says, No, you can't have teeth in your head while you're sleeping for they'll slip and choke you to death entirely. The teeth are the cause of Malachy going to Barrington's Hospital and me having an operation. Malachy whispers to me in the middle of the night, Do you want to go downstairs and see if we can wear the teeth? The teeth are so big we have trouble getting them into our mouths but Malachy won't give up. He forces Dad's upper teeth into his mouth and can't get them out again. His lips are drawn back and the teeth make a big grin. He looks like a monster in a film and it makes me laugh but he pulls at them and grunts, Uck, uck, and tears come to his eyes. The more he goes Uck, uck, the harder I laugh till Dad calls from upstairs, What are you boys doing? Malachy runs from me, up the stairs, and now I hear Dad and Mam laughing till they see he can choke on the teeth. They both stick their fingers in to pull out the teeth but Malachy gets frightened and makes desperate uck uck sounds. Mam says, We'll have to take him to the hospital, and Dad says he'll take him. He makes me go in case the doctor has questions because I'm older than Malachy and that means I must have started all the trouble. Dad rushes through the streets with Malachy in his arms and I try to keep up. I feel sorry for Malachy up there on Dad's shoulder, looking back at me, tears on his cheeks and Dad's teeth bulging in his mouth. The doctor at Barrington's Hospital says, No bother. He pours oil into Malachy's mouth and has the teeth out in a minute. Then he looks at me and says to Dad, Why is that child standing there with his mouth hanging open? Dad says, That's a habit he has, standing with his mouth open. The doctor says, Come here to me. He looks up my nose, in my ears, down my throat, and feels my neck. The tonsils, he says. The adenoids. They have to come out. The sooner the better or he'll look like an idiot when he grows up with that gob wide as a boot. Next day Malachy gets a big piece of toffee as a reward for sticking in teeth he can't get out and I have to go to the hospital to have an operation that will close my mouth. On a Saturday morning Mam finishes her tea and says, You're going to dance. Dance? Why? You're seven years old, you made your First Communion, and now 'tis time for the dancing. I'm taking you down to Catherine Street to Mrs. O'Connor's Irish dancing classes. You'll go there every Saturday morning and that'll keep you off the streets. That'll keep you from wandering around Limerick with hooligans. She tells me wash my face not forgetting ears and neck, comb my hair, blow my nose, take the look off my face, what look? never mind, just take it off, put on my stockings and my First Communion shoes which, she says, are destroyed because I can't pass a canister or a rock without kicking it. She's worn out standing in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society begging for boots for me and Malachy so that we can wear out the toes with the kicking. Your father says it's never too early to learn the songs and dances of your ancestors. What's ancestors? Never mind, she says, you're going to dance. I wonder how I can die for Ireland if I have to sing and dance for Ireland, too. I wonder why they never say, You can eat sweets and stay home from school and go swimming for Ireland. Mam says, Don't get smart or I'll warm your ear. Cyril Benson dances. He has medals hanging from his shoulders to his kneecaps. He wins contests all over Ireland and he looks lovely in his saffron kilt. He's a credit to his mother and he gets his name in the paper all the time and you can be sure he brings home the odd few pounds. You don't see him roaming the streets kicking everything in sight till the toes hang out of his boots, oh, no, he's a good boy, dancing for his poor mother. Mam wets an old towel and scrubs my face till it stings, she wraps the towel around her finger and sticks it in my ears and claims there's enough wax there to grow potatoes, she wets my hair to make it lie down, she tells me shut up and stop the whinging, that these dancing lessons will cost her sixpence every Saturday, which I could have earned bringing Bill Galvin his dinner and God knows she can barely afford it. I try to tell her, Ah, Mam, sure you don't have to send me to dancing school when you could be smoking a nice Woodbine and having a cup of tea, but she says, Oh, aren't you clever. You're going to dance if I have to give up the fags forever. If my pals see my mother dragging me through the streets to an Irish dancing class I'll be disgraced entirely. They think it's all right to dance and pretend you're Fred Astaire because you can jump all over the screen with Ginger Rogers. There is no Ginger Rogers in Irish dancing and you can't jump all over. You stand straight up and down and keep your arms against yourself and kick your legs up and around and never smile. My uncle Pa Keating said Irish dancers look like they have steel rods up their arses, but I can't say that to Mam, she'd kill me. There's a gramophone in Mrs. O'Connor's playing an Irish jig or a reel and boys and girls are dancing around kicking their legs out and keeping their hands to their sides. Mrs. O'Connor is a great fat woman and when she stops the record to show the steps all the fat from her chin to her ankles jiggles and I wonder how she can teach the dancing. She comes over to my mother and says, So, this is little Frankie? I think we have the makings of a dancer here. Boys and girls, do we have the makings of a dancer here? We do, Mrs. O'Connor. Mam says, I have the sixpence, Mrs. O'Connor. Ah, yes, Mrs. McCourt, hold on a minute. She waddles to a table and brings back the head of a black boy with kinky hair, big eyes, huge red lips and an open mouth. She tells me put the sixpence in the mouth and take my hand out before the black boy bites me. All the boys and girls watch and they have little smiles. I drop in the sixpence and pull my hand back before the mouth snaps shut. Everyone laughs and I know they wanted to see my hand caught in the mouth. Mrs. O'Connor gasps and laughs and says to my mother, Isn't that a howl, now? Mam says it's a howl. She tells me behave myself and come home dancing. I don't want to stay in this place where Mrs. O'Connor can't take the sixpence herself instead of letting me nearly lose my hand in the black boy's mouth. I don't want to stay in this place where you have to stand in line with boys and girls, straighten your back, hands by your sides, look ahead, don't look down, move your feet, move your feet, look at Cyril, look at Cyril, and there goes Cyril, all dressed up in his saffron kilt and the medals jingling, medals for this and medals for that and the girls love Cyril and Mrs. O'Connor loves Cyril for didn't he bring her fame and didn't she teach him every step he knows, oh, dance, Cyril, dance, oh, Jesus, he floats around the room, he's an angel out of heaven and stop the frowning, Frankie McCourt, or you'll have a puss on you like a pound of tripe, dance, Frankie, dance, pick up your feet for the love o' Jesus, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree, Maura, will you help that Frankie McCourt before he ties his two feet around his poll entirely, help him, Maura. Maura is a big girl about ten. She dances up to me with her white teeth and her dancer's dress with all the gold and yellow and green figures that are supposed to come from olden times and she says, Give me your hand, little boy, and she wheels me around the room till I'm dizzy and making a pure eejit of myself and blushing and foolish till I want to cry but I'm saved when the record stops and the gramophone goes hoosh hoosh. Mrs. O'Connor says, Oh, thank you, Maura, and next week, Cyril, you can show Frankie a few of the steps that made you famous. Next week, boys and girls, and don't forget the sixpence for the little black boy. Boys and girls leave together. I make my own way down the stairs and out the door hoping my pals won't see me with boys who wear kilts and girls with white teeth and fancy dresses from olden times. Mam is having tea with Bridey Hannon, her friend from next door. Mam says, What did you learn? and makes me dance around the kitchen, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree. She has a good laugh with Bridey. That's not too bad for your first time. In a month you'll be like a regular Cyril Benson. I don't want to be Cyril Benson. I want to be Fred Astaire. They turn hysterical, laughing and squirting tea out of their mouths, Jesus love him, says Bridey. Doesn't he have a great notion of himself. Fred Astaire how are you. Mam says Fred Astaire went to his lessons every Saturday and didn't go around kicking the toes out of his boots and if I wanted to be like him I'd have to go to Mrs. O'Connor's every week. The fourth Saturday morning Billy Campbell knocks at our door. Mrs. McCourt, can Frankie come out and play? Mam tells him, No, Billy. Frankie is going to his dancing lesson. He waits for me at the bottom of Barrack Hill. He wants to know why I'm dancing, that everyone knows dancing is a sissy thing and I'll wind up like Cyril Benson wearing a kilt and medals and dancing all over with girls. He says next thing I'll be sitting in the kitchen knitting socks. He says dancing will destroy me and I won't be fit to play any kind of football, soccer, rugby or Gaelic football itself because the dancing teaches you to run like a sissy and everyone will laugh. I tell him I'm finished with the dancing, that I have sixpence in my pocket for Mrs. O'Connor that's supposed to go into the black boy's mouth, that I'm going to the Lyric Cinema instead. Sixpence will get the two of us in with tuppence left over for two squares of Cleeves' toffee, and we have a great time looking at Riders of the Purple Sage. Dad is sitting by the fire with Mam and they want to know what steps I learned today and what they're called. I already did ""The Siege of Ennis"" and ""The Walls of Limerick, "" which are real dances. Now I have to make up names and dances. Mam says she never heard of a dance called ""The Siege of Dingle""but if that's what I learned go ahead, dance it, and I dance around the kitchen with my hands down by my sides making my own music, diddley eye di eye di eye diddley eye do you do you, Dad and Mam clapping in time with my feet. Dad says, Och, that's a fine dance and you'll be a powerful Irish dancer and a credit to the men who died for their country. Mam says, That wasn't much for a sixpence. Next week it's a George Raft film and the week after that a cowboy film with George O'Brien. Then it's James Cagney and I can't take Billy because I want to get a bar of chocolate to go with my Cleeves' toffee and I'm having a great time till there's a terrible pain in my jaw and it's a tooth out of my gum stuck in my toffee and the pain is killing me. Still, I can't waste the toffee so I pull out the tooth and put it in my pocket and chew the toffee on the other side of my mouth blood and all. There's pain on one side and delicious toffee on the other and I remember what my uncle Pa Keating would say, There are times when you wouldn't know whether to shit or go blind. I have to go home now and worry because you can't go through the world short a tooth without your mother knowing. Mothers know everything and she's always looking into our mouths to see if there's any class of disease. She's there by the fire and Dad is there and they're asking me the same old questions, the dance and the name of the dance. I tell them I learned ""The Walls of Cork"" and I dance around the kitchen trying to hum a made up tune and dying with the pain of my tooth. Mam says, ""Walls o' Cork, "" my eye, there's no such dance, and Dad says, Come over here. Stand there before me. Tell us the truth, Did you go to your dancing classes today? I can't tell a lie anymore because my gum is killing me and there's blood in my mouth. Besides, I know they know everything and that's what they're telling me now. Some snake of a boy from the dancing school saw me going to the Lyric Cinema and told and Mrs. O'Connor sent a note to say she hadn't seen me in ages and was I all right because I had great promise and could follow in the footsteps of the great Cyril Benson. Dad doesn't care about my tooth or anything. He says I'm going to confession and drags me over to the Redemptorist church because it's Saturday and confessions go on all day. He tells me I'm a bad boy, he's ashamed of me that I went to the pictures instead of learning Ireland's national dances, the jig, the reel, the dances that men and women fought and died for down those sad centuries. He says there's many a young man that was hanged and now moldering in a lime pit that would be glad to rise up and dance the Irish dance. The priest is old and I have to yell my sins at him and he tells me I'm a hooligan for going to the pictures instead of my dancing lessons although he thinks himself that dancing is a dangerous thing almost as bad as the films, that it stirs up thoughts sinful in themselves, but even if dancing is an abomination I sinned by taking my mother's sixpence and lying and there's a hot place in hell for the likes of me, say a decade of the rosary and ask God's forgiveness for you're dancing at the gates of hell itself, child. I'm seven, eight, nine going on ten and still Dad has no work. He drinks his tea in the morning, signs for the dole at the Labour Exchange, reads the papers at the Carnegie Library, goes for his long walks far into the country. If he gets a job at the Limerick Cement Company or Rank's Flour Mills he loses it in the third week. He loses it because he goes to the pubs on the third Friday of the job, drinks all his wages and misses the half day of work on Saturday morning. Mam says, Why can't he be like the other men from the lanes of Limerick? They're home before the Angelus rings at six o'clock, they hand over their wages, change their shirts, have their tea, get a few shillings from the wife and they're off to the pub for a pint or two. Mam tells Bridey Hannon that Dad can't be like that and won't be like that. She says he's a right bloody fool the way he goes to pubs and stands pints to other men while his own children are home with their bellies stuck to their backbones for the want of a decent dinner. He'll brag to the world he did his bit for Ireland when it was neither popular nor profitable, that he'll gladly die for Ireland when the call comes, that he regrets he has only one life to give for his poor misfortunate country and if anyone disagrees they're invited to step outside and settle this for once and for all. Oh, no, says Mam, they won't disagree and they won't step outside, that bunch of tinkers and knackers and begrudgers that hang around the pubs. They tell him he's a grand man, even if he's from the North, and 'twould be an honor to accept a pint from such a patriot. Mam tells Bridey, I don't know under God what I'm going to do. The dole is nineteen shillings and sixpence a week, the rent is six and six, and that leaves thirteen shillings to feed and clothe five people and keep us warm in the winter. Bridey drags on her Woodbine, drinks her tea and declares that God is good. Mam says she's sure God is good for someone somewhere but He hasn't been seen lately in the lanes of Limerick. Bridey laughs. Oh, Angela, you could go to hell for that, and Mam says, Aren't I there already, Bridey? And they laugh and drink their tea and smoke their Woodbines and tell one another the fag is the only comfort they have. 'Tis. Question Quigley tells me I have to go to the Redemptorist church on Friday and join the boys' division of the Arch Confraternity. You have to join. You can't say no. All the boys in the lanes and back streets that have fathers on the dole or working in laboring jobs have to join. Question says, Your father is a foreigner from the North and he don't matter but you still have to join. Everyone knows Limerick is the holiest city in Ireland because it has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family, the biggest sodality in the world. Any city can have a Confraternity, only Limerick has the Arch. Our Confraternity fills the Redemptorist church five nights a week, three for the men, one for the women, one for the boys. There is Benediction and hymn singing in English, Irish and Latin and best of all the big powerful sermon Redemptorist priests are famous for. It's the sermon that saves millions of Chinese and other heathens from winding up in hell with the Protestants. The Question says you have to join the Confraternity so that your mother can tell the St. Vincent de Paul Society and they'll know you're a good Catholic. He says his father is a loyal member and that's how he got a good pensionable job cleaning lavatories at the railway station and when he grows up himself he'll get a good job too unless he runs away and joins the Royal Canadian Mounted Police so that he can sing ""I'll Be Calling You Ooo Ooo Ooo, "" like Nelson Eddy singing to Jeanette MacDonald expiring with consumption there on the sofa. If he brings me to the Confraternity the man in the office will write his name in a big book and some day he might be promoted to prefect of a section, which is all he wants in life next to wearing the Mountie uniform. The prefect is head of a section which is thirty boys from the same lanes and streets. Every section has the name of a saint whose picture is painted on a shield stuck on top of a pole by the prefect's seat. The prefect and his assistant take the attendance and keep an eye on us so that they can give us a thump on the head in case we laugh during Benediction or commit any other sacrileges. If you miss one night the man in the office wants to know why, wants to know if you're slipping away from the Confraternity or he might say to the other man in the office, I think our little friend here has taken the soup. That's the worst thing you can say to any Catholic in Limerick or Ireland itself because of what happened in the Great Famine. If you're absent twice the man in the office sends you a yellow summons to appear and explain yourself and if you're absent three times he sends The Posse, which is five or six big boys from your section who search the streets to make sure you're not out enjoying yourself when you should be on your knees at the Confraternity praying for the Chinese and other lost souls. The Posse will go to your house and tell your mother your immortal soul is in danger. Some mothers worry but others will say, Get away from my door or I'll come out and give every one o' ye a good fong in the hole of yeer arse. These are not good Confraternity mothers and the director will say we should pray for them that they'll see the error of their ways. The worst thing of all is a visit from the director of the Confraternity himself, Father Gorey. He'll stand at the top of the lane and roar in the voice that converted the Chinese millions, Where is the house of Frank McCourt? He roars even though he has your address in his pocket and knows very well where you live. He roars because he wants the world to know you're slipping away from the Confraternity and putting your immortal soul in danger. The mothers are terrified and the fathers will whisper, I'm not here, I'm not here, and they'll make sure you go to the Confraternity from this on out so they won't be disgraced and shamed entirely with the neighbors muttering behind their hands. The Question takes me to the section St. Finbar's, and the prefect tells me sit over there and shut up. His name is Declan Collopy, he's fourteen and he has lumps on his forehead that look like horns. He has thick ginger eyebrows that meet in the middle and hang over his eyes and his arms hang down to his kneecaps. He tells me he's making this the best section in the Confraternity and if I'm ever absent he'll break my arse and send the bits to my mother. There's no excuse for absence because there was a boy in another section that was dying and still they brought him in on a stretcher. He says, If you're ever absent it better be a death, not a death in the family but your own death. Do you hear me? I do, Declan. Boys in my section tell me that prefects get rewards if there is perfect attendance. Declan wants to get out of school as soon as he can and get a job selling linoleum at Cannock's big shop on Patrick Street. His uncle, Foncey, sold linoleum there for years and made enough money to start his own shop in Dublin, where he has his three sons selling linoleum. Father Gorey, the director, can easily get Declan the reward of a job at Cannock's if he's a good prefect and has perfect attendance in his section and that's why Declan will destroy us if we're absent. He tells us, No one will stand between me and the linoleum. Declan likes Question Quigley and lets him miss an occasional Friday night because the Question said, Declan, when I grow up and get married I'm going to cover my house in linoleum and I'll buy it all from you. Other boys in the section try this trick with Declan but he says, Bugger off, ye'll be lucky enough to have a pot to piss in never mind yards of linoleum. Dad says when he was my age in Toome he served Mass for years and it's time for me to be an altar boy. Mam says, What's the use? The child doesn't have proper clothes for school never mind the altar. Dad says the altar boy robes will cover the clothes and she says we don't have the money for robes and the wash they need every week. He says God will provide and makes me kneel on the kitchen floor. He takes the part of the priest for he has the whole Mass in his head and I have to know the responses. He says, Introibo ad altare Dei, and I have to say, Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam. Every evening after tea I kneel for the Latin and he won't let me move till I'm perfect. Mam says he could at least let me sit but he says Latin is sacred and it is to be learned and recited on the knees. You won't find the Pope sitting around drinking tea while he speaks the Latin. The Latin is hard and my knees are sore and scabby and I'd like to be out in the lane playing though still I'd like to be an altar boy helping the priest vest in the sacristy, up there on the altar all decked out in my red and white robes like my pal Jimmy Clark, answering the priest in Latin, moving the big book from one side of the tabernacle to the other, pouring water and wine into the chalice, pouring water over the priest's hands, ringing the bell at Consecration, kneeling, bowing, swinging the censer at Benediction, sitting off to the side with the palms of my hands on my knees all serious while he gives his sermon, everyone in St. Joseph's looking at me and admiring my ways. In a fortnight I have the Mass in my head and it's time to go to St. Joseph's to see the sacristan, Stephen Carey, who is in charge of altar boys. Dad polishes my boots. Mam darns my socks and throws an extra coal on the fire to heat up the iron to press my shirt. She boils water to scrub my head, neck, hands and knees and any inch of skin that shows. She scrubs till my skin burns and tells Dad she wouldn't give it to the world to say her son went on the altar dirty. She wishes I didn't have scabby knees from running around kicking canisters and falling down pretending I was the greatest footballer in the world. She wishes we had a drop of hair oil in the house but water and spit will keep my hair from sticking up like black straw in a mattress. She warns me speak up when I go to St. Joseph's and don't be mumbling in English or Latin. She says, 'Tis a great pity you grew out of your First Communion suit but you have nothing to be ashamed of, you come from good blood, McCourts, Sheehans, or my mother's family the Guilfoyles that owned acre after acre in County Limerick before the English took it away and gave it to footpads from London. Dad holds my hand going through the streets and people look at us because of the way we're saying Latin back and forth. He knocks at the sacristy door and tells Stephen Carey, This is my son, Frank, who knows the Latin and is ready to be an altar boy. Stephen Carey looks at him, then me. He says, We don't have room for him, and closes the door. Dad is still holding my hand and squeezes till it hurts and I want to cry out. He says nothing on the way home. He takes off his cap, sits by the fire and lights a Woodbine. Mam is smoking, too. Well, she says, is he going to be an altar boy? There's no room for him. Oh. She puffs on her Woodbine. I'll tell you what it is, she says. 'Tis class distinction. They don't want boys from lanes on the altar. They don't want the ones with scabby knees and hair sticking up. Oh, no, they want the nice boys with hair oil and new shoes that have fathers with suits and ties and steady jobs. That's what it is and 'tis hard to hold on to the Faith with the snobbery that's in it. Och, aye. Oh, och aye my arse. That's all you ever say. You could go to the priest and tell him you have a son that has a head stuffed with Latin and why can't he be an altar boy and what is he going to do with all that Latin? Och, he might grow up to be a priest. I ask him if I can go out and play. Yes, he says, go out and play. Mam says, You might as well. VI Mr. O'Neill is the master in the fourth class at school. We call him Dotty because he's small like a dot. He teaches in the one classroom with a platform so that he can stand above us and threaten us with his ash plant and peel his apple for all to see. The first day of school in September he writes on the blackboard three words which are to stay there the rest of the year, Euclid, geometry, idiot. He says if he catches any boy interfering with these words that boy will go through the rest of his life with one hand. He says anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Now, repeat after me, Anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Of course we all know what an idiot is because that's what the masters keep telling us we are. Brendan Quigley raises his hand. Sir, what's a theorem and what's a Euclid? We expect Dotty to lash at Brendan the way all the masters do when you ask them a question but he looks at Brendan with a little smile. Ah, now, here's a boy with not one but two questions. What is your name, boy? Brendan Quigley, sir. This is a boy who will go far. Where will he go, boys? Far, sir. Indeed and he will. The boy who wants to know something about the grace, elegance and beauty of Euclid can go nowhere but up. In what direction and no other can this boy go, boys? Up, sir. Without Euclid, boys, mathematics would be a poor doddering thing. Without Euclid we wouldn't be able to go from here to there. Without Euclid the bicycle would have no wheel. Without Euclid St. Joseph could not have been a carpenter for carpentry is geometry and geometry is carpentry. Without Euclid this very school could never have been built. Paddy Clohessy mutters behind me, Feckin' Euclid. Dotty barks at him. You, boy, what is your name? Clohessy, sir. Ah, the boy flies on one wing. What is your Christian name? Paddy. Paddy what? Paddy, sir. And what, Paddy, were you saying to McCourt? I said we down on our two knees and thank God for Euclid. I'm sure you did, Clohessy. I see the lie festering in What do I see, boys? The lie, sir. And what is the lie doing, boys? Festering, sir. Where, boys, where? In his teeth, sir. Euclid, boys, was a Greek. What, Clohessy, is a Greek? Some class of a foreigner, sir. Clohessy, you are a half-wit. Now, Brendan, surely you should get your teeth. know what a Greek is? Yes, sir. Euclid was a Greek. Dotty gives him the little smile. He tells Clohessy he should model himself on Quigley, who knows what a Greek is. He draws two lines side by side and tells us these are parallel lines and the magical and mysterious thing is that they never meet, not if they were to be extended to infinity, not if they were extended to God's shoulders and that, boys, is a long way though there is a German Jew who is upsetting the whole world with his ideas on parallel lines. We listen to Dotty and wonder what all this has to do with the state of the world with the Germans marching everywhere and bombing everything that stands. We can't ask him ourselves but we can get Brendan Quigley to do it. Anyone can see Brendan is the master's pet and that means he can ask any question he likes. After school we tell Brendan he has to ask the question tomorrow, What use is Euclid and all those lines that go on forever when the Germans are bombing everything? Brendan says he doesn't want to be the master's pet, he didn't ask for it, and he doesn't want to ask the question. He's afraid if he asks that question Dotty will attack him. We tell him if he doesn't ask the question we'll attack him. Next day Brendan raises his hand. Dotty gives him the little smile. Sir, what use is Euclid and all the lines when the Germans are bombing everything that stands? The little smile is gone. Ah, Brendan. Ah, Quigley. Oh, boys, oh, boys. He lays his stick on the desk and stands on the platform with his eyes closed. What use is Euclid? he says. Use? Without Euclid the Messerschmitt could never have taken to the sky. Without Euclid the Spitfire could not dart from cloud to cloud. Euclid brings us grace and beauty and elegance. What does he bring us, boys? Grace, sir. And? Beauty, sir. And? Elegance, sir. Euclid is complete in himself and divine in application. Do you understand that, boys? We do, sir. I doubt it, boys, I doubt it. To love Euclid is to be alone in this world. He opens his eyes and sighs and you can see the eyes are a little watery. Paddy Clohessy is leaving the school that day and he's stopped by Mr. O'Dea, who teaches the fifth class. Mr. O'Dea says, You, what's your name? Clohessy, sir. What class are you in? Fourth class, sir. Now tell me, Clohessy, is that master of yours talking to you about Euclid? He is, sir. And what is he saying? He's saying he's a Greek. Of course he is, you diddering omadhaun. What else is he saying? He's saying there would be no school without Euclid. Ah. Now is he drawing anything on the board? He's drawing lines side by side that will never meet even if they land on God's shoulders. Mother o' God. No, sir. God's shoulders. I know, you idiot. Go home. The next day there's a great noise at our classroom door and Mr. O'Dea is yelling, Come out, O'Neill, you chancer, you poltroon. We can hear everything he's saying because of the broken glass over the door. The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, is saying, Now, now, Mr. O'Dea. Control yourself. No quarreling in front of our pupils. Well, then, Mr. O'Halloran, tell him stop teaching the geometry. The geometry is for the fifth form and not the fourth. The geometry is mine. Tell him to teach the long division and leave Euclid to me. Long division will stretch his intellect such as it is, God help us. I don't want the minds of these boys destroyed by that chancer up there on the platform, him handing out apple skins and causing diarrhea right and left. Tell him Euclid is mine, Mr. O'Halloran, or I'll put a stop to his gallop. Mr. O'Halloran tells Mr. O'Dea to return to his classroom and asks Mr. O'Neill to step into the hall. Mr. O'Halloran says, Now, Mr. O'Neill, I have asked you before to stay away from Euclid. You have, Mr. O'Halloran, but you might as well ask me to stop eating my daily apple. I'll have to insist, Mr. O'Neill. No more Euclid. Mr. O'Neill comes back to the room and his eyes are watery again. He says little has changed since the time of the Greeks for the barbarians are within the gates and their names are legion. What has changed since the time of the Greeks, boys? It is torture to watch Mr. O'Neill peel the apple every day, to see the length of it, red or green, and if you're up near him to catch the freshness of it in your nose. If you're the good boy for that day and you answer the questions he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk so that you can eat it in peace with no one to bother you the way they would if you took it into the yard. Then they'd torment you, Gimme a piece, gimme a piece, and you'd be lucky to have an inch left for yourself. There are days when the questions are too hard and he torments us by dropping the apple peel into the wastebasket. Then he borrows a boy from another class to take the wastebasket down to the furnace to burn papers and apple peel or he'll leave it for the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, to take it all away in her big canvas sack. We'd like to ask Nellie to keep the peel for us before the rats get it but she's weary from cleaning the whole school by herself and she snaps at us, I have other things to be doin' with me life besides watchin' a scabby bunch rootin' around for the skin of an apple. Go 'way. He peels the apple slowly. He looks around the room with the little smile. He teases us, Do you think, boys, I should give this to the pigeons on the windowsill? We say, No, sir, pigeons don't eat apples. Paddy Clohessy calls out, 'Twill give them the runs, sir, and we'll have it on our heads abroad in the yard. Clohessy, you are an omadhaun. Do you know what an omadhaun is? I don't, sir. It's the Irish, Clohessy, your native tongue, Clohessy. An omadhaun is a fool, Clohessy. You are an omadhaun. What is he, boys? An omadhaun, sir. Clohessy says, That's what Mr. O'Dea called me, sir, a diddering omadhaun. He pauses in his peeling to ask us questions about everything in the world and the boy with the best answers wins. Hands up, he says, who is the President of the United States of America? Every hand in the class goes up and we're all disgusted when he asks a question that any omadhaun would know. We call out, Roosevelt. Then he says, You, Mulcahy, who stood at the foot of the cross when Our Lord was crucified? Mulcahy is slow. The Twelve Apostles, sir. Mulcahy, what is the Irish word for fool? Omadhaun, sir. And what are you, Mulcahy? An omadhaun, sir. Fintan Slattery raises his hand. I know who stood at the foot of the cross, sir. Of course Fintan knows who stood at the foot of the cross. Why wouldn't he? He's always running off to Mass with his mother, who is known for her holiness. She's so holy her husband ran off to Canada to cut down trees, glad to be gone and never to be heard from again. She and Fintan say the rosary every night on their knees in the kitchen and read all kinds of religious magazines: The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart, The Lantern, The Far East, as well as every little book printed by the Catholic Truth Society. They go to Mass and Communion rain or shine and every Saturday they confess to the Jesuits who are known for their interest in intelligent sins not the usual sins you hear from people in lanes who are known for getting drunk and sometimes eating meat on Fridays before it goes bad and cursing on top of it. Fintan and his mother live on Catherine Street and Mrs. Slattery's neighbors call her Mrs. Offer-It-Up because no matter what happens, a broken leg, a spilled cup of tea, a disappeared husband, she says, Well, now, I'll offer that up and I'll have no end of Indulgences to get me into heaven. Fintan is just as bad. If you push him in the schoolyard or call him names he'll smile and tell you he'll pray for you and he'll offer it up for his soul and yours. The boys in Leamy's don't want Fintan praying for them and they threaten to give him a good fong in the arse if they catch him praying for them. He says he wants to be a saint when he grows up, which is ridiculous because you can't be a saint till you're dead. He says our grandchildren will be praying to his picture. One big boy says, My grandchildren will piss on your picture, and Fintan just smiles. His sister ran away to England when she was seventeen and everyone knows he wears her blouse at home and curls his hair with hot iron tongs every Saturday night so that he'll look gorgeous at Mass on Sunday. If he meets you going to Mass he'll say, Isn't my hair gorgeous, Frankie? He loves that word, gorgeous, and no other boy will ever use it. Of course he knows who stood at the foot of the cross. He probably knows what they were wearing and what they had for breakfast and now he's telling Dotty O'Neill it was the three Marys. Dotty says, Come up here, Fintan, and take your reward. He takes his time going to the platform and we can't believe our eyes when he takes out a pocketknife to cut the apple peel into little bits so that he can eat them one by one and not be stuffing the whole thing into his mouth like the rest of us when we win. He raises his hand, Sir, I'd like to give some of my apple away. The apple, Fintan? No, indeed. You do not have the apple, Fintan. You have the peel, the mere skin. You have not nor will you ever achieve heights so dizzy you'll be feasting on the apple itself. Not my apple, Fintan. Now did I hear you say you want to give away your reward? You did, sir. I'd like to give three pieces, to Quigley, Clohessy and McCourt. Why, Fintan? They're my friends, sir. The boys around the room are sneering and nudging each other and I feel ashamed because they'll say I curl my hair and I'll be tormented in the schoolyard and why does he think I'm his friend? If they say I wear my sister's blouse there's no use telling them I don't have a sister because they'll say, You'd wear it if you had a sister. There's no use saying anything in the schoolyard because there's always someone with an answer and there's nothing you can do but punch them in the nose and if you were to punch everyone who has an answer you'd be punching morning noon and night. Quigley takes the bit of peel from Fintan. Thanks, Fintan. The whole class is looking at Clohessy because he's the biggest and the toughest and if he says thanks I'll say thanks. He says, Thanks very much, Fintan, and blushes and I say, Thanks very much, Fintan, and I try to stop myself from blushing but I can't and all the boys sneer again and I'd like to hit them. After school the boys call to Fintan, Hoi, Fintan, are you goin'home to curl your gorgeous hair? Fintan smiles and climbs the steps of the schoolyard. A big boy from seventh class says to Paddy Clohessy, I suppose you'd be curlin' your hair too if you wasn't a baldy with a shaved head. Paddy says, Shurrup, and the boy says, Oh, an' who's goin' to make me? Paddy tries a punch but the big boy hits his nose and knocks him down and there's blood. I try to hit the big boy but he grabs me by the throat and bangs my head against the wall till I see lights and black dots. Paddy walks away holding his nose and crying and the big boy pushes me after him. Fintan is outside on the street and he says, Oh, Francis, Francis, oh, Patrick, Patrick, what's up? Why are you crying, Patrick? and Paddy says, I'm hungry. I can't fight nobody because I'm starving with the hunger an' fallin' down an' I'm ashamed of meself. Fintan says, Come with me, Patrick. My mother will give us something, and Paddy says, Ah, no, me nose is bleedin'. Don't worry. She'll put something on your nose or a key on the back of your neck. Francis, you must come, too. You always look hungry. Ah, no, Fintan. Ah, do, Francis. All right, Fintan. Fintan's flat is like a chapel. There are two pictures, the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Jesus is showing His heart with the crown of thorns, the fire, the blood. His head is tilted to the left to show His great sorrow. The Virgin Mary is showing her heart and it would be a pleasant heart if it didn't have that crown of thorns. Her head is tilted to the right to show her sorrow because she knows her Son will come to a sad end. There's a picture on another wall of a man with a brown robe and birds sitting all over him. Fintan says, Do you know who that is, Francis? No? That's your patron, St. Francis of Assisi, and do you know what today is? The fourth of October. That's right and it's his feast day and special for you because you can ask St. Francis for anything and he'll surely give it to you. That's why I wanted you to come here today. Sit down, Patrick, sit down, Francis. Mrs. Slattery comes in with her rosary beads in her hand. She's happy to meet Fintan's new friends and would we like a cheese sandwich? And look at your poor nose, Patrick. She touches his nose with the cross on her rosary beads and says a little prayer. She tells us these rosary beads were blessed by the Pope himself and would stop the flow of a river if requested never mind Patrick's poor nose. Fintan says he won't have a sandwich because he's fasting and praying for the boy who hit Paddy and me. Mrs. Slattery gives him a kiss on the head and tells him he's a saint out of heaven and asks if we'd like mustard on our sandwiches and I tell her I never heard of mustard on cheese and I'd love it. Paddy says, I dunno. I never had a sangwidge in me life, and we all laugh and I wonder how you could live ten years like Paddy and never have a sandwich. Paddy laughs, too, and you can see his teeth are white and black and green. We eat the sandwich and drink tea and Paddy wants to know where the lavatory is. Fintan takes him through the bedroom to the backyard and when they come back Paddy says, I have to go home. Me mother'll kill me. I'll wait for you outside, Frankie. Now I have to go to the lavatory and Fintan leads me to the backyard. He says, I have to go, too, and when I unbutton my fly I can't pee because he's looking at me and he says, You were fooling. You don't have to go at all. I like to look at you, Francis. That's all. I wouldn't want to commit any class of a sin with our Confirmation coming next year. Paddy and I leave together. I'm bursting and run behind a garage to pee. Paddy is waiting for me and as we walk along Hartstonge Street he says, That was a powerful sangwidge, Frankie, an' him an' his mother is very holy but I wouldn't want to go to Fintan's flat anymore because he's very odd, isn't he, Frankie? He is, Paddy. The way he looks at it when you take it out, that's odd, isn't it, Frankie? 'Tis, Paddy. A few days later Paddy whispers, Fintan Slattery said we could come to his flat at lunchtime. His mother won't be there and she leaves his lunch for him. He might give us some too and he has lovely milk. Will we go? Fintan sits two rows from us. He knows what Paddy is saying to me and he moves his eyebrows up and down as if to say, Will you come? I whisper yes to Paddy and he nods to Fintan and the master barks at us to stop waggling our eyebrows and our lips or the ash plant will sing across our backsides. Boys in the schoolyard see the three of us walk out and they pass remarks. Oh, Gawd, look at Fintan and his ingles. Paddy says, Fintan, what's an ingle? and Fintan says it's just a boy from olden times who sits in a corner, that's all. He tells us sit at the table in his kitchen and we can read his comic books if we like, Film Fun, the Beano, the Dandy, or the religious magazines or his mother's romance magazines, the Miracle and the Oracle, which always have stories about factory girls who are poor but beautiful in love with sons of earls and vice versa and the factory girl ends up throwing herself into the Thames with the hopelessness only to be rescued by a passing carpenter who is poor but honest and will love the factory girl for her own humble self though it turns out the passing carpenter is really the son of a duke, which is much higher than an earl, so that now the poor factory girl is a duchess and can look down her nose at the earl who spurned her because she's happy tending her roses on her twelve-thousand-acre estate in Shropshire and being kind to her poor old mother, who refuses to leave her humble little cottage for all the money in the world. Paddy says, I don't want to read nothing, it's all a cod, all them stories. Fintan removes the cloth covering his sandwich and glass of milk. The milk looks creamy and cool and delicious and the sandwich bread is almost as white. Paddy says, Is that a ham sangwidge? and Fintan says, 'Tis. Paddy says, That's a lovely looking sangwidge and is there mustard on it? Fintan nods and slices the sandwich in two. Mustard seeps out. He licks it off his fingers and takes a nice mouthful of milk. He cuts the sandwich again into quarters, eighths, sixteenths, takes The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart from the pile of magazines and reads while he eats his sandwich bits and drinks his milk and Paddy and I look at him and I know Paddy is wondering what we're doing here at all, at all, because that's what I'm wondering myself hoping Fintan will pass over the plate to us but he doesn't, he finishes the milk, leaves bits of sandwich on the plate, covers it with the cloth and wipes his lips in his dainty way, lowers his head, blesses himself and says grace after meals and, God, we'll be late for school, and blesses himself again on the way out with holy water from the little china font hanging by the door with the little image of the Virgin Mary showing her heart and pointing at it with two fingers as if we couldn't make it out for ourselves. It's too late for Paddy and me to run and get the bun and milk from Nellie Ahearn and I don't know how I'm going to last from now till I can run home after school and get a piece of bread. Paddy stops at the school gate. He says, I can't go in there starving with the hunger. I'd fall asleep and Dotty'd kill me. Fintan is anxious. Come on, come on, we'll be late. Come on, Francis, hurry up. I'm not going in, Fintan. You had your lunch. We had nothing. Paddy explodes. You're a feckin' chancer, Fintan. That's what you are an' a feckin' begrudger too with your feckin' sangwidge an' your feckin' Sacred Heart of Jesus on the wall an' your feckin' holy water. You can kiss my arse, Fintan. Oh, Patrick. Oh, Patrick my feckin' arse, Fintan. Come on, Frankie. Fintan runs into school and Paddy and I make our way to an orchard in Ballinacurra. We climb a wall and a fierce dog comes at us till Paddy talks to him and tells him he's a good dog and we're hungry and go home to your mother. The dog licks Paddy's face and trots away waving his tail and Paddy is delighted with himself. We stuff apples into our shirts till we can barely get back over the wall to run into a long field and sit under a hedge eating the apples till we can't swallow another bit and we stick our faces into a stream for the lovely cool water. Then we run to opposite ends of a ditch to shit and wipe ourselves with grass and thick leaves. Paddy is squatting and saying, There's nothing in the world like a good feed of apples, a drink of water and a good shit, better than any sangwidge of cheese and mustard and Dotty O'Neill can shove his apple up his arse. There are three cows in a field with their heads over a stone wall and they say moo to us. Paddy says, Bejasus, 'tis milkin' time, and he's over the wall, stretched on his back under a cow with her big udder hanging into his face. He pulls on a teat and squirts milk into his mouth. He stops squirting and says, Come on, Frankie, fresh milk. 'Tis lovely. Get that other cow, they're all ready for the milkin'. I get under the cow and pull on a teat but she kicks and moves and I'm sure she's going to kill me. Paddy comes over and shows me how to do it, pull hard and straight and the milk comes out in a powerful stream. The two of us lie under the one cow and we're having a great time filling ourselves with milk when there's a roar and there's a man with a stick charging across the field. We're over the wall in a minute and he can't follow us because of his rubber boots. He stands at the wall and shakes his stick and shouts that if he ever catches us we'll have the length of his boot up our arses and we laugh because we're out of harm's way and I'm wondering why anyone should be hungry in a world full of milk and apples. It's all right for Paddy to say Dotty can shove the apple up his arse but I don't want to rob orchards and milk cows forever and I'll always try to win Dotty's apple peel so that I can go home and tell Dad how I answered the hard questions. We're walking back through Ballinacurra. There's rain and lightning and we run but it's hard for me with the sole of my shoe flapping and threatening to trip me. Paddy can run all he wants in his long bare feet and you hear them slapping on the pavement. My shoes and stockings are soaked and they make their own sound, squish, squish. Paddy notices that and we make a song from our two sounds, slap slap, squish, squish, slap squish, squish slap. We laugh so hard over our song we have to hold on to one another. The rain gets heavier and we know we can't stand under a tree or we'll be fried entirely so we stand by a door which is opened in a minute by a big fat maid in a little white hat and a black dress with a little white apron who tells us get away from this door we're a disgrace. We run from the door and Paddy calls back, Mullingar heifer, beef to the heels, and he laughs till he chokes and has to lean against a wall with the weakness. There's no sense in standing in from the rain anymore, we're soaked to the skin, so we take our time down O'Connell Avenue. Paddy says he learned that Mullingar heifer thing from his uncle Peter, the one that was in India in the English army and they have a photo of him standing with a group of soldiers with their helmets and guns and bandoliers around their chests and there are dark men in uniform who are Indians and loyal to the King. Uncle Peter had a great time for himself in a place called Kashmir, which is lovelier than Killarney that they're always bragging about and singing. Paddy goes on again about running away and winding up in India in a silken tent with the girl with the red dot and the curry and the figs and he's making me hungry even if I'm stuffed with apples and milk. The rain is clearing and there are birds honking over our heads. Paddy says they're ducks or geese or something on their way to Africa where it's nice and warm. The birds have more sense than the Irish. They come to the Shannon for their holidays and then they go back to the warm places, maybe even India. He says he'll write me a letter when he's over there and I can come to India and have my own girl with a red dot. What's that dot for, Paddy? It shows they're high class, the quality. But, Paddy, would the quality in India talk to you if they knew you were from a lane in Limerick and had no shoes? Course they would, but the English quality wouldn't. The English quality wouldn't give you the steam of their piss. Steam of their piss? God, Paddy, did you think of that yourself? Naw, naw, that's what my father says below in the bed when he's coughin' up the gobs and blamin' the English for everything. And I think, Steam of their piss. I'll keep that for myself. I'll go around Limerick saying it, Steam of their piss, Steam of their piss, and when I go to America some day I'll be the only one who knows it. Question Quigley is wobbling toward us on a big woman's bicycle and calls to me, Hoi, Frankie McCourt, you're going to be killed. Dotty O'Neill sent a note to your house and said you didn't come back to school after lunch, that you went on the mooch with Paddy Clohessy. Your mother is going to kill you. Your father is out looking for you and he's going to kill you, too. Oh, God, I feel cold and empty and I wish I could be in India where it's nice and warm and there's no school and my father could never find me to kill me. Paddy tells the Question, He didn't go on the mooch and I didn't either. Fintan Slattery starved us to death and we were too late for the bun and the milk. Then Paddy says to me, Don't mind 'em, Frankie, 'tis all a cod. They're always sendin' notes to our house and we wipe our arses with them. My mother and father would never wipe their arses with a note from the master and I'm afraid now to go home. The Question rides off on the bicycle, laughing, and I don't know why because he once ran away from home and slept in a ditch with four goats and that's worse than mooching from school half a day anytime. I could turn up the Barrack Road now and go home and tell my parents I'm sorry I went on the mooch and I did it because of the hunger but Paddy says, Come on, we'll go down the Dock Road and throw rocks in the Shannon. We throw rocks in the river and we swing on the iron chains along the bank. It's getting dark and I don't know where I'm going to sleep. I might have to stay there by the Shannon or find a door or I might have to go back out the country and find a ditch like Brendan Quigley with four goats. Paddy says I can go home with him, I can sleep on the floor and I'll dry out. Paddy lives in one of the tall houses on Arthur's Quay looking at the river. Everyone in Limerick knows these houses are old and might fall down at any minute. Mam often says, I don't want any of ye going down to Arthur's Quay and if I find ye there I'll break yeer faces. The people down there are wild and ye could get robbed and killed. It's raining again and small children are playing in the hallway and up the stairs. Paddy says, Mind yourself, because some of the steps are missing and there is shit on the ones that are still there. He says that's because there's only one privy and it's in the backyard and children don't get down the stairs in time to put their little arses on the bowl, God help us. There's a woman with a shawl sitting on the fourth flight smoking a cigarette. She says, Is that you, Paddy? 'Tis, Mammy. I'm fagged out, Paddy. Them steps is killin' me. Did you have your tea? I didn't. Well, I don't know if there's any bread left. Go up an' see. Paddy's family live in one big room with a high ceiling and a small fireplace. There are two tall windows and you can see out to the Shannon. His father is in a bed in the corner, groaning and spitting into a bucket. Paddy's brothers and sisters are on mattresses on the floor, sleeping, talking, looking at the ceiling. There's a baby with no clothes crawling over to Paddy's father's bucket and Paddy pulls him away. His mother comes in, gasping, from the stairs. Jesus, I'm dead, she says. She finds some bread and makes weak tea for Paddy and me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. They don't say anything. They don't say what are you doing here or go home or anything till Mr. Clohessy says, Who's that? and Paddy tells him, 'Tis Frankie McCourt. Mr. Clohessy says, McCourt? What class of a name is that? My father is from the North, Mr. Clohessy. And what's your mother's name? Angela, Mr. Clohessy. Ah, Jaysus, 'twouldn't be Angela Sheehan, would it? 'Twould, Mr. Clohessy. Ah, Jaysus, he says, and he has a coughing fit which brings up all kinds of stuff from his insides and has him hanging over the bucket. When the cough passes he falls back on the pillow. Ah, Frankie, I knew your mother well. Danced with her, Mother o' Christ, I'm dying inside, danced with her I did below in the Wembley Hall and a champion dancer she was too. He hangs over the bucket again. He gasps for air and reaches his arms out to get it. He suffers but he won't stop talking. Champion dancer she was, Frankie. Not skinny mind you but a feather in my arms and there was many a sorry man when she left Limerick. Can you dance, Frankie? Ah, no, Mr. Clohessy. Paddy says, He can, Dada. He had the lessons from Mrs. O'Connor and Cyril Benson. Well, dance, Frankie. Round the house an' mind the dresser, Frankie. Lift the foot, lad. I can't, Mr. Clohessy. I'm no good. No good? Angela's Sheehan's son? Dance, Frankie, or I'll get outa this bed an' wheel you round the house. My shoe is broken, Mr. Clohessy. Frankie, Frankie, you're bringin' the cough on me. Will you dance for the love o' Jesus so I can remember me youth with your mother in the Wembley Hall. Take off the feckin' shoe, Frankie, an' dance. I have to make up dances and tunes to go with them the way I did a long time ago when I was young. I dance around the room with one shoe because I forgot to take it off. I try to make up words, Oh, The Walls of Limerick are falling down, falling down, falling down, The Walls of Limerick falling down and the River Shannon kills us. Mr. Clohessy is laughing in the bed. Oh, Jaysus, I never heard likes o' that on land or sea. That's a great leg for the dancing you have there, Frankie. Oh, Jaysus. He coughs and brings up ropes of green and yellow stuff. It makes me sick to look at it and I wonder if I should go home from all this sickness and this bucket and let my parents kill me if they want to. Paddy lies down on a mattress by the window and I lie beside him. I keep my clothes on like everybody else and I even forget to take off my other shoe, which is wet and squishy and stinks. Paddy falls asleep right away and I look at his mother sitting by the bit of a fire smoking another cigarette. Paddy's father groans and coughs and spits into the bucket. He says, Feckin' blood, and she says, You'll have to go into the sanatorium sooner or later. I will not. The day they put you in there is the end of you. You could be givin'the consumption to the children. I could get the guards to take you away you're that much of a danger to the children. If they were to get it they'd have it be now. The fire dies and Mrs. Clohessy climbs over him into the bed. In a minute she's snoring even if he's still coughing and laughing about the days of his youth when he danced with Angela Sheehan light as a feather in the Wembley Hall. It's cold in the room and I'm shivering in my wet clothes. Paddy is shivering too but he's asleep and he doesn't know he's cold. I don't know if I should stay here or get up and go home but who wants to be wandering the streets when a guard might ask you what you're doing out. It's my first time away from my family and I know I'd rather be in my own house with the smelly lavatory and stable next door. It's bad when our kitchen is a lake and we have to go up to Italy but it's worse in the Clohessys' when you have to go down four flights to the lavatory and slip on shit all the way down. I'd be better off with four goats in a ditch. I drift in and out of sleep but I have to wake up for good when Mrs. Clohessy goes around pulling at her family to get them up. They all went to bed with their clothes on so they don't have to get dressed and there's no fighting. They grumble and run out the door to get downstairs to the backyard lavatory. I have to go too and I run down with Paddy but his sister Peggy is on the bowl and we have to piss against a wall. She says, I'll tell Ma what ye did, and Paddy says, Shurrup or I'll push you down into that feckin' lavatory. She jumps off the lavatory, pulls her drawers up and runs up the stairs crying, I'll tell, I'll tell, and when we get back to the room Mrs. Clohessy gives Paddy a belt on the head for what he did to his poor little sister. Paddy says nothing because Mrs. Clohessy is spooning porridge into mugs and jam jars and one bowl and telling us to eat up and go to school. She sits at the table eating her porridge. Her hair is gray black and dirty. It dangles in the bowl and picks up bits of porridge and drops of milk. The children slurp the porridge and complain they didn't get enough, they're starving with the hunger. They have snotty noses and sore eyes and scabby knees. Mr. Clohessy coughs and squirms on the bed and brings up the great gobs of blood and I run out of the room and puke on the stairs where there's a step missing and there's a shower of porridge and bits of apple to the floor below where people go back and forth to the lavatory in the yard. Paddy comes down and says, Sure that's all right. Everywan gets sick an' shits on them stairs an' the whole feckin' place is falling down anyway. I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. If I go back to school I'll be killed and why should I go back to school or go home to get killed when I can go out the road and live on milk and apples the rest of my life till I go to America. Paddy says, Come on. School is all a cod anyway an' the masters is all madmen. There's a knock at the Clohessys' door and it's Mam holding my little brother, Michael, by the hand, and Guard Dennehy, who is in charge of school attendance. Mam sees me and says, What are you doing with one shoe on? and Guard Dennehy says, Ah, now, missus, I think a more important question would be, What are you doing with one shoe off, ha, ha. Michael runs to me. Mammy was crying. Mammy was crying for you, Frankie. She says, Where were you all night? I was here. You had me demented. Your father walked every street in Limerick looking for you. Mr. Clohessy says, Who's at the door? It's my mother, Mr. Clohessy. God above, is that Angela? 'Tis, Mr. Clohessy. He struggles up on his elbows. Well, for the love of God, will you come in, Angela. Don't you know me? Mam looks puzzled. It's dark in the room and she tries to make out who is in the bed. He says, 'Tis me, Dennis Clohessy, Angela. Ah, no. 'Tis, Angela. Ah, no. I know, Angela. I'm changed. The cough is killin' me. But I remember the nights at the Wembley Hall. Aw, Jaysus, you were a great dancer. Nights at the Wembley Hall, Angela, and the fish and chips after. Oh, boys, oh, boys, Angela. My mother has tears running down her face. She says, You were a great dancer yourself, Dennis Clohessy. We could have won competitions, Angela. Fred and Ginger would have been lookin' over their shoulders but you had to run off to America. Aw, Jaysus. He has another coughing fit and we have to stand and watch him hang over the bucket again and bring up the bad stuff from his insides. Guard Dennehy says, I think, missus, we found the by an' I'll be going. He says to me, If you ever go on the mooch again, by, we'll have you in the jail above. Are you listenin' to me, by? I am, Guard. Don't be tormentin' your mother, by. That's wan thing the guards won't put up with, the tormentin' of mothers. I won't, Guard. I won't torment her. He leaves and Mam goes to the bed to take Mr. Clohessy's hand. His face is caved in all around his eyes and his hair is shiny black with the sweat running from the top of his head. His children stand around the bed looking at him and looking at Mam. Mrs. Clohessy sits by the fire rattling the poker in the grate and pushing the baby away from the fire. She says, 'Tis his own bloody fault for not goin' into hospital, so 'tis. Mr. Clohessy gasps, I'd be all right if I could live in a dry place. Angela, is America a dry place? 'Tis, Dennis. The doctor told me go to Arizona. A funny man that doctor. Arizona how are you. I don't have the money to go around the corner for a pint. Mam says, You'll be all right, Dennis. I'll light a candle for you. Save your money, Angela. My dancin' days are done. I have to go now, Dennis. My son has to go to school. Before you go, Angela, will you do one thing for me? I will, Dennis, if 'tis in my power. Would you ever give us a verse of that song you sang the night before you went to America? That's a hard song, Dennis. I wouldn't have the wind for it. Ah, come on, Angela. I never hear a song anymore. There isn't a song in this house. The wife there doesn't have a note in her head an' no step in her foot. Mam says, All right. I'll try. Oh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune, Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon. When the boys began to gather in the glen of a Summer night, And the Kerry piper's tuning made us long with wild delight. She stops and presses her hand to her chest, Oh, God, my wind is gone. Help me, Frank, with the song, and I sing along, Oh, to think of it, Oh, to dream of it, fills my heart with tears. Oh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon. Mr. Clohessy tries to sing with us, gone, alas, like our youth too soon, but it brings on the cough. He shakes his head and cries, I wouldn't doubt you, Angela. It takes me back. God bless you. God bless you, too, Dennis, and thanks, Mrs. Clohessy, for having Frankie here off the streets. 'Twas no trouble, Mrs. McCourt. He's quiet enough. Quiet enough, says Mr. Clohessy, but he's not the dancer his mother was. Mam says, 'Tis hard to dance with one shoe, Dennis. I know, Angela, but you'd wonder why he didn't take it off. Is he a bit strange? Ah, sometimes he has the odd manner like his father. Oh, yes. The father is from the North, Angela, and that would account for it. They'd think nothing of dancing with one shoe in the North. We walk up Patrick Street and O'Connell Street, Paddy Clohessy and Mam and Michael and myself, and Mam sobs all the way. Michael says, Don't cry, Mammy. Frankie won't run away. She lifts him up and hugs him. Oh, no, Michael, 'tisn't Frankie I'm crying about. 'Tis Dennis Clohessy and the dancing nights at the Wembley Hall and the fish and chips after. She comes into the school with us. Mr. O'Neill looks cross and tells us sit down he'll be with us in a minute. He talks a long time at the door with my mother and when she leaves he walks between the seats and pats Paddy Clohessy on the head. I'm very sorry for the Clohessys and all their troubles but I think they saved me from getting into trouble with my mother. VII There are Thursdays when Dad gets his dole money at the Labour Exchange and a man might say, Will we go for a pint, Malachy? and Dad will say, One, only one, and the man will say, Oh, God, yes, one, and before the night is over all the money is gone and Dad comes home singing and getting us out of bed to line up and promise to die for Ireland when the call comes. He even gets Michael up and he's only three but there he is singing and promising to die for Ireland at the first opportunity. That's what Dad calls it, the first opportunity. I'm nine and Malachy is eight and we know all the songs. We sing all the verses of Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley, ""The West's Asleep, "" ""O'Donnell Abu, "" ""The Boys of Wexford. "" We sing and promise to die because you never know when Dad might have a penny or two left over from the drinking and if he gives it to us we can run to Kathleen O'Connell's next day for toffee. Some nights he says Michael is the best singer of all and he gives him the penny. Malachy and I wonder what's the use of being eight and nine and knowing all the songs and ready to die when Michael gets the penny so that he can go to the shop next day and stuff his gob with toffee galore. No one can ask him to die for Ireland at the age of three, not even Padraig Pearse, who was shot by the English in Dublin in 1916 and expected the whole world to die with him. Besides, Mikey Molloy's father said anyone who wants to die for Ireland is a donkey's arse. Men have been dying for Ireland since the beginning of time and look at the state of the country. It's bad enough that Dad loses jobs in the third week but now he drinks all the dole money once a month. Mam gets desperate and in the morning she has the bitter face and she won't talk to him. He has his tea and leaves the house early for the long walk into the country. When he returns in the evening she still won't talk to him and she won't make his tea. If the fire is dead for the want of coal or turf and there's no way of boiling water for the tea, he says, Och, aye, and drinks water out of a jam jar and smacks his lips the way he would with a pint of porter. He says good water is all a man needs and Mam makes a snorting sound. When she's not talking to him the house is heavy and cold and we know we're not supposed to talk to him either for fear she'll give us the bitter look. We know Dad has done the bad thing and we know you can make anyone suffer by not talking to him. Even little Michael knows that when Dad does the bad thing you don't talk to him from Friday to Monday and when he tries to lift you to his lap you run to Mam. I'm nine years old and I have a pal, Mickey Spellacy, whose relations are dropping one by one of the galloping consumption. I envy Mickey because every time someone dies in his family he gets a week off from school and his mother stitches a black diamond patch on his sleeve so that he can wander from lane to lane and street to street and people will know he has the grief and pat his head and give him money and sweets for his sorrow. But this summer Mickey is worried. His sister, Brenda, is wasting away with the consumption and it's only August and if she dies before September he won't get his week off from school because you can't get a week off from school when there's no school. He comes to Billy Campbell and me to ask if we'll go around the corner to St. Joseph's Church and pray for Brenda to hang on till September. What's in it for us, Mickey, if we go around the corner praying? Well, if Brenda hangs on and I get me week off ye can come to the wake and have ham and cheese and cake and sherry and lemonade and everything and ye can listen to the songs and stories all night. Who could say no to that? There's nothing like a wake for having a good time. We trot around to the church where they have statues of St. Joseph himself as well as the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and St. Thérèse of Lisieux, the Little Flower. I pray to the Little Flower because she died of the consumption herself and she'd understand. One of our prayers must have been powerful because Brenda stays alive and doesn't die till the second day of school. We tell Mickey we're sorry for his troubles but he's delighted with his week off and he gets the black diamond patch which will bring the money and sweets. My mouth is watering at the thought of the feast at Brenda's wake. Billy knocks on the door and there's Mickey's aunt. Well? We came to say a prayer for Brenda and Mickey said we could come to the wake. She yells, Mickey! What? Come here. Did you tell this gang they could come to your sister's wake? No. But, Mickey, you promised... She slams the door in our faces. We don't know what to do till Billy Campbell says, We'll go back to St. Joseph's and pray that from now on everyone in Mickey Spellacy's family will die in the middle of the summer and he'll never get a day off from school for the rest of his life. One of our prayers is surely powerful because next summer Mickey himself is carried off by the galloping consumption and he doesn't get a day off from school and that will surely teach him a lesson. Proddy Woddy ring the bell, Not for heaven but for hell. On Sunday mornings in Limerick I watch them go to church, the Protestants, and I feel sorry for them, especially the girls, who are so lovely, they have such beautiful white teeth. I feel sorry for the beautiful Protestant girls, they're doomed. That's what the priests tell us. Outside the Catholic Church there is no salvation. Outside the Catholic Church there is nothing but doom. And I want to save them. Protestant girl, come with me to the True Church. You'll be saved and you won't have the doom. After Mass on Sunday I go with my friend Billy Campbell to watch them play croquet on the lovely lawn beside their church on Barrington Street. Croquet is a Protestant game. They hit the ball with the mallet, pock and pock again, and laugh. I wonder how they can laugh or don't they even know they're doomed? I feel sorry for them and I say, Billy, what's the use of playing croquet when you're doomed? He says, Frankie, what's the use of not playing croquet when you're doomed? Grandma says to Mam, Your brother Pat, bad leg an' all, was selling papers all over Limerick by the time he was eight and that Frank of yours is big and ugly enough to work. But he's only nine and still in school. School. 'Tis school that has him the way he is talkin' back an' goin' around with the sour puss an' the odd manner like his father. He could get out an' help poor Pat of a Friday night when the Limerick Leader is a ton weight. He could run up the long garden paths of the quality an' save Pat's poor legs an' earn a few pennies into the bargain. He has to go to the Confraternity on Friday nights. Never mind the Confraternity. There's nothin' in the catechism about confraternities. I meet Uncle Pat at the Limerick Leader on Friday evening at five. The man handing out the papers says my arms are that skinny I'd be lucky to carry two stamps but Uncle Pat sticks eight papers under each arm. He tells me, I'll kill you if you drop 'em for 'tis raining abroad, pelting out of the heavens. He tells me hug the walls going up O'Connell Street to keep the papers dry. I'm to run in where there's a delivery, climb the outside steps, in the door, up the stairs, yell Paper, get the money they owe him for the week, down the stairs, give him the money and on to the next stop. Customers give him tips for his troubles and he keeps them for himself. We make our way up O'Connell Avenue, out Ballinacurra, in by the South Circular Road, down Henry Street and back to the office for more papers. Uncle Pat wears a cap and a thing like a cowboy poncho to keep his papers dry but he complains his feet are killing him and we stop in a pub for a pint for his poor feet. Uncle Pa Keating is there all black and having a pint and he says to Uncle Pat, Ab, are you going to let that boy stand there with his face hanging out for the want of a lemonade? Uncle Pat says, Wha? and Uncle Pa Keating gets impatient. Christ, he's dragging your feckin' papers all over Limerick and you can't-Oh, never mind. Timmy, give the child a lemonade. Frankie, don't you have a raincoat at home? No, Uncle Pa. You're not supposed to be out in this weather. You're drenched entirely. Who sent you out in this muck? Grandma said I had to help Uncle Pat because of his bad leg. Course she did, the oul' bitch, but don't tell them I said that. Uncle Pat is struggling off the seat and gathering up his papers. Come on, 'tis gettin' dark. He hobbles along the streets calling, Anna Lie Sweets Lie, which doesn't sound a bit like Limerick Leader and it doesn't matter because everyone knows this is Ab Sheehan that was dropped on his head. Here, Ab, give us a Leader, how's your poor leg, keep the change an' get yourself a fag for 'tis an awful feckin' night to be out sellin' the feckin' papers. Tanks, says Ab, my uncle. Tanks, tanks, tanks, and it's hard to keep up with him on the streets bad as his leg is. He says, How many Leaders have you under your oxter? One, Uncle Pat. Take that Leader in to Mr. Timoney. He owes me for a fortnight now. Get that money an' there's a tip. He's a good man for the tip an' don't be shovin' it in your pocket like your cousin Gerry. Shoved it in his pocket, the little bugger. I bang on the door with the knocker and there's a great howl from a dog so big he makes the door shake. A man's voice says, Macushla, quit the bloody racket or I'll give you a good fong in the arse for yourself. The racket stops, the door opens and the man is there, white hair, thick glasses, white sweater, a stick in his hand. He says, Who is it? Who do we have? The paper, Mr. Timoney. We don't have Ab Sheehan here, do we? I'm his nephew, sir. Is it Gerry Sheehan we have here? No, sir. I'm Frank McCourt. Another nephew? Does he make them? Is there a little nephew factory in the backyard? Here's the money for the fortnight and give me the paper or keep it. What's the use? I can't read anymore and Mrs. Minihan that's supposed to read to me didn't come. Legless with the sherry, that's what she is. What's your name? Frank, sir. Can you read? I can, sir. Do you want to earn a sixpence? I do, sir. Come here tomorrow. Your name is Francis, isn't it? Frank, sir. Your name is Francis. There was never a St. Frank. That's a name for gangsters and politicians. Come here tomorrow at eleven and read to me. I will, sir. Are you sure you can read? I am, sir. You can call me Mr. Timoney. I will, Mr. Timoney. Uncle Pat is mumbling at the gate, rubbing his leg. Where's me money an' you're not supposed to be chattin' with the customers an' me here with the leg destroyed be the rain. He has to stop at the pub at Punch's Cross to have a pint for the destroyed leg. After the pint he says he can't walk another inch and we get on a bus. The conductor says, Fares, please, fares, but Uncle Pat says, Go 'way an' don't be botherin' me, can't you see the state o' me leg? Oh, all right, Ab, all right. The bus stops at the O'Connell Monument and Uncle Pat goes to the Monument Fish and Chip Café where the smells are so delicious my stomach beats with the hunger. He gets a shilling's worth of fish and chips and my mouth is watering but when we get to Grandma's door he gives me a threepenny bit, tells me meet him again next Friday and go home now to my mother. The dog Macushla is lying outside Mr. Timoney's door and when I open the little garden gate to go up the path she rushes at me and knocks me back out on the pavement and she'd eat my face if Mr. Timoney didn't come out and flail at her with his stick and yell, Come in out of it, ye hoor, ye overgrown man eatin' bitch. Didn't you have your breakfast, you hoor? Are you all right, Francis? Come in. That dog is a right Hindu, so she is, and that's where I found her mother wandering around Bangalore. If ever you're getting a dog, Francis, make sure it's a Buddhist. Good natured dogs, the Buddhists. Never, never get a Mahommedan. They'll eat you sleeping. Never a Catholic dog. They'll eat you every day including Fridays. Sit down and read to me. The Limerick Leader, Mr. Timoney? No, not the bloody Limerick Leader. I wouldn't wipe the hole of my arse with the Limerick Leader. There's a book over there on the table, Gulliver's Travels. That's not what I want you to read. Look in the back for another thing, A Modest Proposal. Read that to me. It begins, It is a melancholy object to those who walk... Do you have that? I have the whole bloody thing in my head but I still want you to read to me. He stops me after two or three pages. You're a good reader. And what do you think of that, Francis, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled, eh? Macushla would love a dinner of a nice plump Irish infant, wouldn't you, you oul' hoor? He gives me sixpence, and tells me return next Saturday. Mam is delighted I earned sixpence for reading to Mr. Timoney and what was it he wanted read, the Limerick Leader? I tell her I had to read A Modest Proposal from the back of Gulliver's Travels and she says, That's all right, 'tis only a children's book. You'd expect him to want something strange for he's a little off in the head after years in the sun in the English army in India and they say he was married to one of them Indian women and she was accidentally shot by a soldier during some class of a disturbance. That's the kind of thing that would drive you to children's books. She knows this Mrs. Minihan who lives next door to Mr. Timoney and used to clean house but couldn't stand it anymore the way he laughed at the Catholic Church and said one man's sin was another man's romp. Mrs. Minihan didn't mind the odd drop of sherry of a Saturday morning but then he tried to turn her into a Buddhist, which he said he was himself and the Irish would be much better off in general if they sat under a tree and watched the Ten Commandments and the Seven Deadly Sins float down the Shannon and far out to sea. The next Friday Declan Collopy from the Confraternity sees me on the street delivering the papers with my uncle Pat Sheehan. Hoi, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' with Ab Sheehan? He's my uncle. You're supposed to be at the Confraternity. I'm working, Declan. You're not supposed to be working. You're not even ten and you're destroyin' the perfect attendance in our section. If you're not there next Friday I'll give you a good thump in the gob, do you hear me? Uncle Pat says, Go 'way, go 'way, or I'll walk on you. Ah, shut up, Mr. Stupid that was dropped on your head. He pushes Uncle Pat on the shoulder and knocks him back against the wall. I drop the papers and run at him but he steps aside and punches me on the back of the neck and my forehead is rammed into the wall and it puts me in such a rage I can't see him anymore. I go at him with arms and legs and if I could tear his face off with my teeth I would but he has long arms like a gorilla and he just keeps pushing me away so that I can't touch him. He says, You mad feckin' eejit. I'll destroy you in the Confraternity, and he runs away. Uncle Pat says, You shouldn't be fightin' like that an' you dropped all me papers an' some o' them is wet an' how am I supposed to sell wet papers, and I wanted to jump on him too and hit him for talking about papers after I stood up to Declan Collopy. At the end of the night he gives me three chips from his bag and sixpence instead of threepence. He complains it's too much money and it's all my mother's fault for going on to Grandma about the low pay. Mam is delighted I'm getting sixpence on Fridays from Uncle Pat and sixpence on Saturdays from Mr. Timoney. A shilling a week makes a big difference and she gives me tuppence to see the Dead End Kids at the Lyric after I'm finished the reading. Next morning Mr. Timoney says, Wait till we get to Gulliver, Francis. You'll know Jonathan Swift is the greatest Irish writer that ever lived, no, the greatest man to put pen to parchment. A giant of a man, Francis. He laughs all through A Modest Proposal and you'd wonder what he's laughing at when it's all about cooking Irish babies. He says, You'll laugh when you grow up, Francis. You're not supposed to talk back to grown-ups but Mr. Timoney is different and he doesn't mind when I say, Mr. Timoney, big people are always telling us that. Oh, you'll laugh when you grow up. You'll understand when you grow up. Everything will come when you grow up. He lets out such a roar of a laugh I think he's going to collapse. Oh, Mother o' God, Francis. You're a treasure. What's up with you? Do you have a bee up your arse? Tell me what's up. Nothing, Mr. Timoney. I think you have the long puss, Francis, and I wish I could Go over to the mirror on the wall, Snow White, and tell me if you the long puss. Never mind. Just tell me what's up. Declan Collopy was at me last night and I got into a fight. He makes me tell him about the Confraternity and Declan and uncle Pat Sheehan, who was dropped on his head, and then he tells knows my uncle Pa Keating, who was gassed in the war and works in works. He says, Pa Keating is a jewel of a man. And I'll tell you I'll do, Francis. I'll talk to Pa Keating and we'll go to the crawthumpers at the Confraternity. I'm a Buddhist myself and I don't hold with fighting but I haven't lost it. They're not going to interfere with my little reader, oh, by Jesus, no. Mr. Timoney is an old man but he talks like a friend and I can say what I feel. Dad would never talk to me like Mr. Timoney. He'd say, Och, aye, and go for a long walk. Uncle Pat Sheehan tells Grandma he doesn't want me to help with the papers anymore, he can get another boy much cheaper and he thinks I should be giving him some of my Saturday morning sixpence anyway since I'd never have the reading job without him. A woman next door to Mr. Timoney tells me I'm wasting my time knocking on the door, Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun on the same day and Mr. Timoney couldn't stop laughing though he cried when the dog was taken away to be put down. You can bite postmen and milkmen all you like but the case of the passing nun goes all the way to the bishop and he takes steps especially if the owner of the dog is a known Buddhist and a danger to good Catholics around him. Mr. Timoney was told this and cried and laughed so hard the doctor came and said he was gone beyond recall so they carted him off to the City Home, where they keep old people who are helpless or demented. That's the end of my Saturday sixpence but I'll read to Mr. Timoney money or no money. I wait down the street till the woman next door goes in, I climb in Mr. Timoney's window for Gulliver'sTravels and walk miles to the City Home so that he won't miss his reading. The man at the gate says, What? You want to come in an' read to an oul' man? Is it coddin' me you are? Get outa here before I call the guards. Could I leave the book for someone else to read to Mr. Timoney? Leave it. Leave it for Jaysus sake an' don't be botherin' me. I'll send it up to him. And he laughs. Mam says, What's up with you? Why are you moping? And I tell her how Uncle Pat doesn't want me anymore and how they put Mr. Timoney in the City Home for laughing just because Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun. She laughs too and I'm sure the world is gone mad. Then she says, Ah, I'm sorry and it's a pity you lost two jobs. You might as well start going to the Confraternity again to keep The Posse away and, worse, the director, Father Gorey. Declan tells me sit in front of him and if there's any blaguarding he'll break my feckin' neck for he'll be watching me as long as he's see it. have my me he the gas what prefect and no little shit like me is going to keep him from a life in linoleum. Mam says she has trouble climbing the stairs and she's moving her bed to the kitchen. She laughs, I'll come back up to Sorrento when the walls are damp and the rain runs under the door. School is over and she can stay in bed in the kitchen as long as she likes because she doesn't have to get up for us. Dad lights the fire, makes the tea, cuts the bread, makes sure we wash our faces and tells us go out and play. He lets us stay in bed if we like but you never want to stay in bed when there's no school. We're ready to run out and play in the lane the minute we wake. Then one day in July he says we can't go downstairs. We have to stay up here and play. Why, Dad? Never mind. Play here with Malachy and Michael and you can go down later when I tell you. He stands at the door in case we might get a notion to wander down the stairs. We push our blanket up in the air with our feet and pretend we're in a tent, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. We hunt fleas and squash them between our thumbnails. Then there's a baby's cry and Malachy says, Dad, did Mam get a new baby? Och, aye, son. I'm older so I tell Malachy the bed is in the kitchen so that the angel can fly down and leave the baby on the seventh step but Malachy doesn't understand because he's only eight going on nine and I'll be ten next month. Mam is in the bed with the new baby. He has a big fat face and he's red all over. There's a woman in the kitchen in a nurse's uniform and we know she's there to wash new babies who are always dirty from the long journey with the angel. We want to tickle the baby but she says, No, no, ye can look at him but don't lay a finger. Don't lay a finger. That's the way nurses talk. We sit at the table with our tea and bread looking at our new brother but he won't even open his eyes to look back at us so we go out and play. In a few days Mam is out of the bed holding the baby on her lap by the fire. His eyes are open and when we tickle him he makes a gurgling sound, his belly shakes and that makes us laugh. Dad tickles him and sings a Scottish song, Oh, oh, stop your ticklin', Jock, Stop your ticklin', Jock. Stop your ticklin', Ickle ickle icklin Stop your ticklin', Jock. Dad has a job so Bridey Hannon is able to visit Mam and the baby any time she likes and for once Mam doesn't tell us go out and play so they can talk about secret things. They sit by the fire smoking and talking about names. Mam says she likes the names Kevin and Sean but Bridey says, Ah, no, there's too many of them in Limerick. Jesus, Angela, if you stuck your head out the door and called, Kevin or Sean, come in for your tea, you'd have half o' Limerick running to your door. Bridey says if she had a son which please God she will some day she'll call him Ronald because she's mad about Ronald Colman that you see in the Coliseum Cinema. Or Errol, now that's another lovely name, Errol Flynn. Mam says, Will you go way outa that, Bridey. I'd never be able to stick my head out the door and say, Errol, Errol, come in for your tea. Sure the poor child would be a laughingstock. Ronald, says Bridey, Ronald. He's gorgeous. No, says Mam, it has to be Irish. Isn't that what we fought for all these years? What's the use of fighting the English for centuries if we're going to call our children Ronald? Jesus, Angela, you're starting to talk like himself with his Irish this and his English that. Still an' all, Bridey, he's right. Suddenly Bridey is gasping, Jesus, Angela, there's something wrong with that child. Mam is out of the chair, hugging the child, moaning. Oh, Jesus, Bridey, he's choking. Bridey says, I'll run for my mother, and she's back in a minute with Mrs. Hannon. Castor oil, says Mrs. Hannon. Do you have it? Any oil. Cod liver oil? That'll do. She pours the oil into the baby's mouth, turns him over, presses on his back, turns him back over, sticks a spoon down his throat and brings up a white ball. That's it now, she says. The milk. It collects and gets hard in their little throats so you have to ease it with any class of an oil. Mam is crying, Jesus, I nearly lost him. Oh, I'd die so I would. She's clutching the baby and crying and trying to thank Mrs. Hannon. Yerra, don't mention it, missus. Take the child and get back into that bed for the two o' ye had a great shock. While Bridey and Mrs. Hannon are helping Mam to the bed I notice spots of blood on her chair. Is my mother bleeding to death? Is it all right to say, Look, there's blood on Mam's chair? No, you can't say anything because they always have secrets. I know if you say anything the grown-up people will tell you, Never mind, you're always gawking, none of your business, go out and play. I have to keep it inside or I can talk to the angel. Mrs. Hannon and Bridey leave and I sit on the seventh step. I try to tell the angel Mam is bleeding to death. I want him to tell me, Fear not, but the step is cold and there's no light, no voice. I'm sure he's gone forever and I wonder if that happens when you go from nine to ten. Mam doesn't bleed to death. She's out of the bed next day getting the baby ready for baptism, telling Bridey she could never forgive herself if the baby died and went to Limbo, a place for unbaptized babies, where it may be nice and warm but, still, dark forever and no hope of escape even on the Judgment Day. Grandma is there to help and she says, That's right, no hope in heaven for the infant that's not baptized. Bridey says it would be a hard God that would do the likes of that. He has to be hard, says Grandma, otherwise you'd have all kinds of babies clamorin' to get into heaven, Protestants an' everything, an' why should they get in after what they did to us for eight hundred years? The babies didn't do it, says Bridey. They're too small. They would if they got the chance, says Grandma. They're trained for it. They dress the baby in the Limerick lace dress we were all baptized in. Mam says we can all go to St. Joseph's and we're excited because there will be lemonade and buns after. Malachy says, Mam, what's the baby's name? Alphonsus Joseph. The words fly out of my mouth, That's a stupid name. It's not even Irish. Grandma glares at me with her old red eyes. She says, That fella needs a good clitther on the gob. Mam slaps me across the face and sends me flying across the kitchen. My heart is pounding and I want to cry but I can't because my father isn't there and I'm the man of the family. Mam says, You go upstairs with your big mouth and don't move from that room. I stop at the seventh step but it's still cold, no light, no voice. The house is quiet with everyone gone to the chapel. I sit and wait upstairs, knocking the fleas off my arms and legs, wishing I had Dad here, thinking of my little brother and his foreign name, Alphonsus, an affliction of a name. In awhile there are voices downstairs and there is talk of tea, sherry, lemonade, buns, and isn't that child the loveliest little fella in the world, little Alphie, foreign name but still an' all still an' all not a sound outa him the whole time he's that good-natured God bless him sure he'll live forever with the sweetness that's in him the little dote spittin' image of his mother his father his grandma his little brothers dead an' gone. Mam calls from the bottom of the stairs, Frank, come down and have lemonade and a bun. I don't want it. You can keep it. I said come down this minute for if I have to climb these stairs I'll warm your behind and you'll rue the day. Rue? What's rue? Never mind what's rue. Come down here at once. Her voice is sharp and rue sounds dangerous. I'll go down. In the kitchen Grandma says, Look at the long puss on him. You'd think he'd be happy for his little brother except that a boy that's going from nine to ten is always a right pain in the arse an' I know for didn't I have two of 'em. The lemonade and bun are delicious and Alphie the new baby is chirping away enjoying his baptism day too innocent to know his name is an affliction. Grandpa in the North sends a telegram money order for five pounds for the baby Alphie. Mam wants to cash it but she can't go far from the bed. Dad says he'll cash it at the post office. She tells Malachy and me to go with him. He cashes it and tells us, All right, boys, go home and tell your mother I'll be home in a few minutes. Malachy says, Dad, you're not to go to the pub. Mam said you're to bring home the money. You're not to drink the pint. Now, now, son. Go home to your mother. Dad, give us the money. That money is for the baby. Now, Francis, don't be a bad boy. Do what your father tells you. He walks away from us and into South's pub. Mam is sitting by the fireplace with Alphie in her arms. She shakes her head. He went to the pub, didn't he? He did. I want ye to go back down to that pub and read him out of it. I want ye to stand in the middle of the pub and tell every man your father is drinking the money for the baby. Ye are to tell the world there isn't a scrap of food in this house, not a lump of coal to start the fire, not a drop of milk for the baby's bottle. We walk through the streets and Malachy practices his speech at the top of his voice, Dad, Dad, that five pounds is for the new baby. That's not for the drink. The child is above in the bed bawling and roaring for his milk and you're drinking the pint. He's gone from South's pub. Malachy still wants to stand and make his speech but I tell him we have to hurry and look in other pubs before Dad drinks the whole five pounds. We can't find him in other pubs either. He knows Mam would come for him or send us and there are so many pubs at this end of Limerick and beyond we could be looking for a month. We have to tell Mam there's no sign of him and she tells us we're pure useless. Oh, Jesus, I wish I had my strength and I'd search every pub in Limerick. I'd tear the mouth out of his head, so I would. Go on, go back down and try all the pubs around the railway station and try Naughton's fish and chip shop. I have to go by myself because Malachy has the runs and can't stray far from the bucket. I search all the pubs on Parnell Street and around. I look into the snugs where the women drink and in all the men's lavatories. I'm hungry but I'm afraid to go home till I find my father. He's not in Naughton's fish and chip shop but there's a drunken man asleep at a table in the corner and his fish and chips are on the floor in their Limerick Leader wrapping and if I don't get them the cat will so I shove them under my jersey and I'm out the door and up the street to sit on the steps at the railway station eat my fish and chips watch the drunken soldiers pass by with the girls that giggle thank the drunken man in my mind for drowning the fish and chips in vinegar and smothering them in salt and then remember that if I die tonight I'm in a state of sin for stealing and I could go straight to hell stuffed with fish and chips but it's Saturday and if the priests are still in the confession boxes I can clear my soul after my feed. The Dominican church is just up Glentworth Street. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession. I tell him the usual sins and then, I stole fish and chips from a drunken man. Why, my child? I was hungry, Father. And why were you hungry? There was nothing in my belly, Father. He says nothing and even though it's dark I know he's shaking his head. My dear child, why can't you go home and ask your mother for something? Because she sent me out looking for my father in the pubs, Father, and I couldn't find him and she hasn't a scrap in the house because he's drinking the five pounds Grandpa sent from the North for the new baby and she's raging by the fire because I can't find my father. I wonder if this priest is asleep because he's very quiet till he says, My child, I sit here. I hear the sins of the poor. I assign the penance. I bestow absolution. I should be on my knees washing their feet. Do you understand me, my child? I tell him I do but I don't. Go home, child. Pray for me. No penance, Father? No, my child. I stole the fish and chips. I'm doomed. You're forgiven. Go. Pray for me. He blesses me in Latin, talks to himself in English and I wonder what I did to him. I wish I could find my father so I could say to Mam, Here he is and he has three pounds left in his pocket. I'm not hungry now so I can go up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and search pubs on the side streets and there he is in Gleeson's, how could I miss him with his singing, 'Tis alone my concern if the grandest surprise Would be shining at me out of somebody's eyes. 'Tis my private affair what my feelings would be While the Green Glens of Antrim were welcoming me. My heart is banging away in my chest and I don't know what to do because I know I'm raging inside like my mother by the fire and all I can think of doing is running in and giving him a good kick in the leg and running out again but I don't because we have the mornings by the fire when he tells me about Cuchulain and De Valera and Roosevelt and if he's there drunk and buying pints with the baby's money he has that look in his eyes Eugene had when he searched for Oliver and I might as well go home and tell my mother a lie that I never saw him couldn't find him. She's in the bed with the baby. Malachy and Michael are up in Italy asleep. I know I don't have to tell Mam anything, that soon when the pubs close he'll be home singing and offering us a penny to die for Ireland and it will be different now because it's bad enough to drink the dole or the wages but a man that drinks the money for a new baby is gone beyond the beyonds as my mother would say. VIII I'm ten years old and ready to go to St. Joseph's Church for my Confirmation. In school the master, Mr. O'Dea, prepares us. We have to know all about Sanctifying Grace, a pearl of great price, bought for us by Jesus in His dying. Mr. O'Dea's eyes roll in his head when he tells us that with Confirmation we will become part of Divinity. We will have the Gifts of the Holy Ghost: Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, the Fear of the Lord. Priests and masters tell us Confirmation means you're a true soldier of the Church and that entitles you to die and be a martyr in case we're invaded by Protestants or Mahommedans or any other class of a heathen. More dying. I want to tell them I won't be able to die for the Faith because I'm already booked to die for Ireland. Mikey Molloy says, Is it jokin' you are? That thing about dying for the Faith is all a cod. 'Tis only a saying they made up to frighten you. Ireland too. No one dies for anything anymore. All the dying is done. I wouldn't die for Ireland or the Faith. I might die for my mother but that's all. Mikey knows everything. He's going on fourteen. He gets the fits. He has visions. The grown-ups tell us it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith, only we're not ready for that yet because Confirmation day is like First Communion day, you make the rounds of lanes and back streets and you get cakes and sweets and money, The Collection. That's where poor Peter Dooley comes in. We call him Quasimodo because he has a hump on his back like the one on the hunchback of Notre Dame, whose real name we know is Charles Laughton. Quasimodo has nine sisters and it is said his mother never wanted him but that was what the angel brought her and it's a sin to question what's sent. Quasimodo is old, he's fifteen. His red hair sticks up in all directions. He has green eyes and one rolls around in his head so much he's constantly tapping his temple to keep it where it's supposed to be. His right leg is short and twisted and when he walks he does a little twirly dance and you never know when he'll fall. That's when you're surprised. He curses his leg, he curses the world, but he curses in a lovely English accent which he got from the radio, the BBC. Before he leaves his house he always sticks his head out the door and tells the lane, Here's me head, me arse is coming. When he was twelve Quasimodo decided that with the way he looked and the way the world looked at him the best thing would be to prepare for a job where he could be heard and not seen and what better than sitting behind a microphone at the BBC in London reading the news? But you can't get to London without money and that's why he hobbles up to us that Friday, the day before Confirmation. He has an idea for Billy and me. He knows the next day we'll be getting Confirmation money and if we promise to pay him a shilling each he'll let us climb up the rainspout behind his house this very night to look in the window and see his sisters' naked bodies when they take their weekly wash. I sign right away. Billy says, I have my own sister. Why should I pay to see your naked sisters? Quasimodo says that looking at your own sister's naked body is the worst sin of all and he's not sure if there's a priest in the world can forgive you, that you might have to go to the bishop, who everyone knows is a holy terror. Billy signs. Friday night we climb the wall of Quasimodo's backyard. It's a lovely night with the June moon floating high over Limerick and you can feel a warm breeze off the Shannon River. Quasimodo is about to let Billy up the spout and who comes clambering over the wall but Mikey Molloy the Fit himself hissing at Quasimodo, Here's a shilling, Quasimodo. Let me up the spout. Mikey is fourteen now, bigger than any of us and strong from his job delivering coal. He's black from the coal like Uncle Pa Keating and all you can see are the whites of his eyes and the white froth on his lower lip, which means he could have the fit anytime. Quasimodo says, Wait, Mikey. They're first. Wait, my arse, says Mikey, and he's away up the spout. Billy complains but Quasimodo shakes his head, I can't help it. He comes every week with the shilling. I have to let him up the spout or he'll beat me up and tell my mother and the next thing she locks me in the coal hole all day with the rats. The Fit is up hanging on to the spout with one hand. The other hand is in his pocket moving, moving and when the spout itself starts to move and creak Quasimodo hisses, Molloy, there's to be no whankin' up the spout. He hops around the yard cackling. His BBC accent is gone and he's pure Limerick. Jaysus, Molloy, come down off that spout or I'll tell me mother. Mikey's hand goes faster in his pocket, so fast the spout gives a lurch and collapses and Mikey is rolling on the ground yelping, I'm dead. I'm destroyed. Oh, God. You can see the froth on his lips and the blood that comes from biting his tongue. Quasimodo's mother comes screaming through the door, What in the name of Jesus! and the kitchen light fills the yard. The sisters are squawking from the window above. Billy tries to escape and she drags him off the wall. She tells him run to O'Connor the chemist around the corner to ring up an ambulance or a doctor or something for Mikey. She screams at us to get into the kitchen. She kicks Quasimodo into the hall. He's on his hands and knees and she drags him to the coal hole under the stairs and locks him in. Stay there till you come to your senses. He's crying and calling to her in a pure Limerick accent. Ah, Mamma, Mamma, let me out. The rats is here. I only want to go to the BBC, Mamma. Aw, Jasus, Mamma, Jasus. I'll never let anyone up the spout again. I'll send money from London, Mamma. Mamma! Mikey is still on his back, jerking and twisting around the yard. The ambulance takes him off to the hospital with a broken shoulder and his tongue in ribbons. Our mothers are there in no time. Mrs. Dooley says, I'm disgraced, so I am, disgraced. My daughters can't wash theirselves of a Friday night without the whole world gawking in the window and them boys there are in a state of sin and should be taken to the priest for confession before their Confirmation tomorrow. But Mam says, I don't know about the rest of the world but I saved a whole year for Frank's Confirmation suit and I'm not going to the priest to have him tell me my son is not fit for Confirmation so that I'll have to wait another year when he grows out of this suit and all because he climbed a spout for an innocent gawk at the scrawny arse of Mona Dooley. She drags me home by the ear and makes me kneel before the Pope. Swear, she says, swear to that Pope that you didn't look at Mona Dooley in her pelt. I swear. If you're lying you won't be in a state of grace for Confirmation tomorrow and that's the worst kind of sacrilege. I swear. Only the bishop himself could forgive a sacrilege like that. I swear. All right. Go to bed and from this day out stay far away from that misfortunate Quasimodo Dooley. We are all confirmed the next day. The bishop asks me a catechism question, What is the Fourth Commandment? and I tell him, Honor thy father and thy mother. He pats my cheek and that makes me a soldier of the True Church. I kneel in the pew and think of Quasimodo locked in the coal hole under the stairs and I wonder, Should I give him the shilling anyway for his career at the BBC? But I forget all about Quasimodo because my nose starts bleeding and I feel dizzy. Confirmation boys and girls are outside St. Joseph's with their parents and there is hugging and kissing in the bright sun and I don't care. My father is working and I don't care. My mother kisses me and I don't care. The boys talk about The Collection and I don't care. My nose won't stop and Mam is worried I'll ruin my suit. She runs into the church to see if Stephen Carey, the sacristan, would spare her a rag and he gives her some kind of canvas cloth that makes my nose sore. She says, Do you want to make your collection? and I tell her I don't care. Malachy says, Do, do, Frankie, and he's sad because I promised I'd take him to the Lyric Cinema to see the film and stuff ourselves with sweets. I want to lie down. I could lie down there on the steps of St. Joseph's and sleep forever. Mam says, Grandma is making a nice breakfast, and the mention of food makes me so sick I run to the edge of the pavement to throw up and the whole world is looking at me and I don't care. Mam says she'd better take me home and put me to bed and my pals look surprised that anyone can go to bed when there's a collection to be made. She helps me take off my Confirmation suit and puts me to bed. She wets a rag and places it under my neck and after awhile the bleeding stops. She brings tea but the look of it makes me sick and I have to throw up in the bucket. Mrs. Hannon comes in from next door and I can hear her say that's a very sick child and he should have a doctor. Mam says it's Saturday, the Dispensary is closed and where would you get a doctor? Dad comes home from his job at Rank's Flour Mills and tells Mam I'm going through a stage, growing pains. Grandma comes up and says the same thing. She says when boys go from the one number year, which is nine, to the two number year, which is ten, they're changing and prone to the nosebleed. She says I might have too much blood in me anyway and a good cleaning out wouldn't do me one bit of harm. The day passes and I'm in and out of sleep. Malachy and Michael come into the bed at night and I can hear Malachy say, Frankie is very hot. Michael says, He's bleeding on my leg. Mam puts the wet rag on my nose and a key on my neck but it won't stop the bleeding. On Sunday morning there's blood on my chest and all around me. Mam tells Dad I'm bleeding through my bottom and he says I might have a case of the runs, which is common with the growing pains. Dr. Troy is our doctor but he's away on holiday and the man that comes to see me on Monday has a smell of whiskey on him. He examines me and tells my mother I have a bad cold and keep me in bed. Days pass and I sleep and bleed. Mam makes tea and beef tea and I don't want it. She even brings ice cream and the look of it makes me sick. Mrs. Hannon comes in again and says that doctor doesn't know what he's talking about, see if Dr. Troy is back. Mam comes with Dr. Troy. He feels my forehead, rolls up my eyelids, turns me over to see my back, picks me up and runs to his motor car. Mam runs after him and he tells her I have typhoid fever. Mam cries, Oh, God, oh, God, am I to lose the whole family? Will it ever end? She gets into the car, holds me in her lap and moans all the way to the Fever Hospital at the City Home. The bed has cool white sheets. The nurses have clean white uniforms and the nun, Sister Rita, is all in white. Dr. Humphrey and Dr. Campbell have white coats and things hanging from their necks which they stick against my chest and all over. I sleep and sleep but I'm awake when they bring in jars of bright red stuff that hang from tall poles above my bed and they stick tubes into my ankles and the back of my right hand. Sister Rita says, You're getting blood, Francis. Soldier's blood from the Sarsfield Barracks. Mam is sitting by the bed and the nurse is saying, You know, missus, this is very unusual. No one is ever allowed into the Fever Hospital for fear they'd catch something but they made an exception for you with his crisis coming. If he gets over this he'll surely recover. I fall asleep. Mam is gone when I wake but there's movement in the room and it's the priest, Father Gorey, from the Confraternity saying Mass at a table in the corner. I drift off again and now they're waking me and pulling down the bedclothes. Father Gorey is touching me with oil and praying in Latin. I know it's Extreme Unction and that means I'm going to die and I don't care. They wake me again to receive Communion. I don't want it, I'm afraid I might get sick. I keep the wafer on my tongue and fall asleep and when I wake up again it's gone. It's dark and Dr. Campbell is sitting by my bed. He's holding my wrist and looking at his watch. He has red hair and glasses and he always smiles when he talks to me. He sits now and hums and looks out the window. His eyes close and he snores a little. He tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I'm going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy. Sister Rita's white habit is bright in the sun that comes in the window. She's holding my wrist, looking at her watch, smiling. Oh, she says, we're awake, are we? Well, Francis, I think we've come through the worst. Our prayers are answered and all the prayers of those hundreds of little boys at the Confraternity. Can you imagine that? Hundreds of boys saying the rosary for you and offering up their communion. My ankles and the back of my hand are throbbing from the tubes bringing in the blood and I don't care about boys praying for me. I can hear the swish of Sister Rita's habit and the click of her rosary beads when she leaves the room. I fall asleep and when I wake it's dark and Dad is sitting by the bed with his hand on mine. Son, are you awake? I try to talk but I'm dry, nothing will come out and I point to my mouth. He holds a glass of water to my lips and it's sweet and cool. He presses my hand and says I'm a great old soldier and why wouldn't I? Don't I have the soldier's blood in me? The tubes are not in me anymore and the glass jars are gone. Sister Rita comes in and tells Dad he has to go. I don't want him to go because he looks sad. He's like Paddy Clohessy the day I gave him the raisin. When he looks sad it's the worst thing in the world and I start crying. Now what's this? says Sister Rita. Crying with all that soldier blood in you? There's a big surprise for you tomorrow, Francis. You'll never guess. Well, I'll tell you, we're bringing you a nice biscuit with your tea in the morning. Isn't that a treat? And your father will be back in a day or two, won't you, Mr. McCourt? Dad nods and puts his hand on mine again. He looks at me, steps away, stops, comes back, kisses me on the forehead for the first time in my life and I'm so happy I feel like floating out of the bed. The other two beds in my room are empty. The nurse says I'm the only typhoid patient and I'm a miracle for getting over the crisis. The room next to me is empty till one morning a girl's voice says, Yoo hoo, who's there? I'm not sure if she's talking to me or someone in the room beyond. Yoo hoo, boy with the typhoid, are you awake? I am. Are you better? I am. Well, why are you here? I don't know. I'm still in the bed. They stick needles in me and give me medicine. What do you look like? I wonder, What kind of a question is that? I don't know what to tell her. Yoo hoo, are you there, typhoid boy? I am. What's your name? Frank. That's a good name. My name is Patricia Madigan. How old are you? Ten. Oh. She sounds disappointed. But I'll be eleven in August, next month. Well, that's better than ten. I'll be fourteen in September. Do you want to know why I'm in the Fever Hospital? I do. I have diphtheria and something else. What's something else? They don't know. They think I have a disease from foreign parts because my father used to be in Africa. I nearly died. Are you going to tell me what you look like? I have black hair. You and millions. I have brown eyes with bits of green that's called hazel. You and thousands. I have stitches on the back of my right hand and my two feet where they put in the soldier's blood. Oh, God, did they? They did. You won't be able to stop marching and saluting. There's a swish of habit and click of beads and then Sister Rita's voice. Now, now, what's this? There's to be no talking between two rooms especially when it's a boy and a girl. Do you hear me, Patricia? I do, Sister. Do you hear me, Francis? I do, Sister. You could be giving thanks for your two remarkable recoveries. You could be saying the rosary. You could be reading The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart that's beside your beds. Don't let me come back and find you talking. She comes into my room and wags her finger at me. Especially you, Francis, after thousands of boys prayed for you at the Confraternity. Give thanks, Francis, give thanks. She leaves and there's silence for awhile. Then Patricia whispers, Give thanks, Francis, give thanks, and say your rosary, Francis, and I laugh so hard a nurse runs in to see if I'm all right. She's a very stern nurse from the County Kerry and she frightens me. What's this, Francis? Laughing? What is there to laugh about? Are you and that Madigan girl talking? I'll report you to Sister Rita. There's to be no laughing for you could be doing serious damage to your internal apparatus. She plods out and Patricia whispers again in a heavy Kerry accent, No laughing, Francis, you could be doin' serious damage to your internal apparatus. Say your rosary, Francis, and pray for your internal apparatus. Mam visits me on Thursdays. I'd like to see my father, too, but I'm out of danger, crisis time is over, and I'm allowed only one visitor. Besides, she says, he's back at work at Rank's Flour Mills and please God this job will last a while with the war on and the English desperate for flour. She brings me a chocolate bar and that proves Dad is working. She could never afford it on the dole. He sends me notes. He tells me my brothers are all praying for me, that I should be a good boy, obey the doctors, the nuns, the nurses, and don't forget to say my prayers. He's sure St. Jude pulled me through the crisis because he's the patron saint of desperate cases and I was indeed a desperate case. Patricia says she has two books by her bed. One is a poetry book and that's the one she loves. The other is a short history of England and do I want it? She gives it to Seamus, the man who mops the floors every day, and he brings it to me. He says, I'm not supposed to be bringing anything from a dipteria room to a typhoid room with all the germs flying around and hiding between the pages and if you ever catch dipteria on top of the typhoid they'll know and I'll lose my good job and be out on the street singing patriotic songs with a tin cup in my hand, which I could easily do because there isn't a song ever written about Ireland's sufferings I don't know and a few songs about the joy of whiskey too. Oh, yes, he knows Roddy McCorley. He'll sing it for me right enough but he's barely into the first verse when the Kerry nurse rushes in. What's this, Seamus? Singing? Of all the people in this hospital you should know the rules against singing. I have a good mind to report you to Sister Rita. Ah, God, don't do that, nurse. Very well, Seamus. I'll let it go this one time. You know the singing could lead to a relapse in these patients. When she leaves he whispers he'll teach me a few songs because singing is good for passing the time when you're by yourself in a typhoid room. He says Patricia is a lovely girl the way she often gives him sweets from the parcel her mother sends every fortnight. He stops mopping the floor and calls to Patricia in the next room, I was telling Frankie you're a lovely girl, Patricia, and she says, You're a lovely man, Seamus. He smiles because he's an old man of forty and he never had children but the ones he can talk to here in the Fever Hospital. He says, Here's the book, Frankie. Isn't it a great pity you have to be reading all about England after all they did to us, that there isn't a history of Ireland to be had in this hospital. The book tells me all about King Alfred and William the Conqueror and all the kings and queens down to Edward, who had to wait forever for his mother, Victoria, to die before he could be king. The book has the first bit of Shakespeare I ever read. I do believe, induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy. The history writer says this is what Catherine, who is a wife of Henry the Eighth, says to Cardinal Wolsey, who is trying to have her head cut off. I don't know what it means and I don't care because it's Shakespeare and it's like having jewels in my mouth when I say the words. If I had a whole book of Shakespeare they could keep me in the hospital for a year. Patricia says she doesn't know what induced means or potent circumstances and she doesn't care about Shakespeare, she has her poetry book and she reads to me from beyond the wall a poem about an owl and a pussycat that went to sea in a green boat with honey and money and it makes no sense and when I say that Patricia gets huffy and says that's the last poem she'll ever read to me. She says I'm always reciting the lines from Shakespeare and they make no sense either. Seamus stops mopping again and tells us we shouldn't be fighting over poetry because we'll have enough to fight about when we grow up and get married. Patricia says she's sorry and I'm sorry too so she reads me part of another poem which I have to remember so I can say it back to her early in the morning or late at night when there are no nuns or nurses about, The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees, The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, And the highwayman came riding Riding riding The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn door. He'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin, A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe skin, They fitted with never a wrinkle, his boots were up to the thigh. And he rode with a jewelled twinkle, His pistol butts a-twinkle, His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky. Every day I can't wait for the doctors and nurses to leave me alone so I can learn a new verse from Patricia and find out what's happening to the highwayman and the landlord's red lipped daughter. I love the poem because it's exciting and almost as good as my two lines of Shakespeare. The redcoats are after the highwayman because they know he told her, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way. I'd love to do that myself, come by moonlight for Patricia in the next room not giving a fiddler's fart though hell should bar the way. She's ready to read the last few verses when in comes the nurse from Kerry shouting at her, shouting at me, I told ye there was to be no talking between rooms. Dipthteria is never allowed to talk to typhoid and visa versa. I warned ye. And she calls out, Seamus, take this one. Take the by. Sister Rita said one more word out of him and upstairs with him. We gave ye a warning to stop the blathering but ye wouldn't. Take the by, Seamus, take him. Ah, now, nurse, sure isn't he harmless. 'Tis only a bit o' poetry. Take that by, Seamus, take him at once. He bends over me and whispers, Ah, God, I'm sorry, Frankie. Here's your English history book. He slips the book under my shirt and lifts me from the bed. He whispers that I'm a feather. I try to see Patricia when we pass through her room but all I can make out is a blur of dark head on a pillow. Sister Rita stops us in the hall to tell me I'm a great disappointment to her, that she expected me to be a good boy after what God had done for me, after all the prayers said by hundreds of boys at the Confraternity, after all the care from the nuns and nurses of the Fever Hospital, after the way they let my mother and father in to see me, a thing rarely allowed, and this is how I repaid them lying in the bed reciting silly poetry back and forth with Patricia Madigan knowing very well there was a ban on all talk between typhoid and diphtheria. She says I'll have plenty of time to reflect on my sins in the big ward upstairs and I should beg God's forgiveness for my disobedience reciting a pagan English poem about a thief on a horse and a maiden with red lips who commits a terrible sin when I could have been praying or reading the life of a saint. She made it her business to read that poem so she did and I'd be well advised to tell the priest in confession. The Kerry nurse follows us upstairs gasping and holding on to the banister. She tells me I better not get the notion she'll be running up to this part of the world every time I have a little pain or a twinge. There are twenty beds in the ward, all white, all empty. The nurse tells Seamus put me at the far end of the ward against the wall to make sure I don't talk to anyone who might be passing the door, which is very unlikely since there isn't another soul on this whole floor. She tells Seamus this was the fever ward during the Great Famine long ago and only God knows how many died here brought in too late for anything but a wash before they were buried and there are stories of cries and moans in the far reaches of the night. She says 'twould break your heart to think of what the English did to us, that if they didn't put the blight on the potato they didn't do much to take it off. No pity. No feeling at all for the people that died in this very ward, children suffering and dying here while the English feasted on roast beef and guzzled the best of wine in their big houses, little children with their mouths all green from trying to eat the grass in the fields beyond, God bless us and save us and guard us from future famines. Seamus says 'twas a terrible thing indeed and he wouldn't want to be walking these halls in the dark with all the little green mouths gaping at him. The nurse takes my temperature, 'Tis up a bit, have a good sleep for yourself now that you're away from the chatter with Patricia Madigan below who will never know a gray hair. She shakes her head at Seamus and he gives her a sad shake back. Nurses and nuns never think you know what they're talking about. If you're ten going on eleven you're supposed to be simple like my uncle Pat Sheehan who was dropped on his head. You can't ask questions. You can't show you understand what the nurse said about Patricia Madigan, that she's going to die, and you can't show you want to cry over this girl who taught you a lovely poem which the nun says is bad. The nurse tells Seamus she has to go and he's to sweep the lint from under my bed and mop up a bit around the ward. Seamus tells me she's a right oul' bitch for running to Sister Rita and complaining about the poem going between the two rooms, that you can't catch a disease from a poem unless it's love ha ha and that's not bloody likely when you're what? ten going on eleven? He never heard the likes of it, a little fella shifted upstairs for saying a poem and he has a good mind to go to the Limerick Leader and tell them print the whole thing except he has this job and he'd lose it if ever Sister Rita found out. Anyway, Frankie, you'll be outa here one of these fine days and you can read all the poetry you want though I don't know about Patricia below, I don't know about Patricia, God help us. He knows about Patricia in two days because she got out of the bed to go to the lavatory when she was supposed to use a bedpan and collapsed and died in the lavatory. Seamus is mopping the floor and there are tears on his cheeks and he's saying, 'Tis a dirty rotten thing to die in a lavatory when you're lovely in yourself. She told me she was sorry she had you reciting that poem and getting you shifted from the room, Frankie. She said 'twas all her fault. It wasn't, Seamus. I know and didn't I tell her that. Patricia is gone and I'll never know what happened to the highwayman and Bess, the landlord's daughter. I ask Seamus but he doesn't know any poetry at all especially English poetry. He knew an Irish poem once but it was about fairies and had no sign of a highwayman in it. Still he'll ask the men in his local pub where there's always someone reciting something and he'll bring it back to me. Won't I be busy meanwhile reading my short history of England and finding out all their perfidy. That's what Seamus says, perfidy, and I don't know means and he doesn't know what it means but if it's something the do it must be terrible. He comes three times a week to mop the floor and the nurse is there every morning to take my temperature and pulse. The doctor listens to my chest with the thing hanging from his neck. They all say, And how's our little soldier today? A girl with a blue dress brings meals three times a day and never talks to me. Seamus says she's not right in the head so don't say a word to her. The July days are long and I fear the dark. There are only two ceiling lights in the ward and they're switched off when the tea tray is taken away and the nurse gives me pills. The nurse tells me go to sleep but I can't because I see people in the nineteen beds in the ward all dying and green around their mouths where they tried to eat grass and moaning for soup Protestant soup any soup and I cover my face with the pillow hoping they won't come and stand around the bed clawing at me and howling for bits of the chocolate bar my mother brought last week. No, she didn't bring it. She had to send it in because I can't have any more visitors. Sister Rita tells me a visit to the Fever Hospital is a privilege and after my bad behavior with Patricia Madigan and that poem I can't have the privilege anymore. She says I'll be going home in a few weeks and my job is to concentrate on getting better and learn to walk again after being in bed for six weeks and I can get out of bed tomorrow after breakfast. I don't know why she says I have to learn how to walk when I've been walking since I was a baby but when the nurse stands me by the side of the bed I fall to the floor and the nurse laughs, See, you're a baby again. I practice walking from bed to bed back and forth back and forth. I don't want to be a baby. I don't want to be in this empty ward with no Patricia and no highwayman and no red lipped landlord's daughter. I don't want the ghosts of children with green mouths pointing bony fingers at me and clamoring for bits of my chocolate bar. Seamus says a man in his pub knew all the verses of the highwayman poem and it has a very sad end. Would I like him to say it because he never learned how to read and he had to carry the poem in his head? He stands in the middle of the ward leaning on his mop and recites, Tlot- tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot in the echoing night! Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light! Her eyes grew wide for a moment, she drew one last deep breath, Then her finger moved in the moonlight, Her musket shattered the moonlight, Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him-with her death. He hears the shot and escapes but when he learns at dawn how Bess died he goes into a rage and returns for revenge only to be shot down by the redcoats. Blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine red was his velvet coat, When they shot him down on the highway, Down like a dog on about what it English the highway, And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat. Seamus wipes his sleeve across his face and sniffles. He says, There was no call at all to shift you up here away from Patricia when you didn't even know what happened to the highwayman and Bess. 'Tis a very sad story and when I said it to my wife she wouldn't stop crying the whole night till we went to bed. She said there was no call for them redcoats to shoot that highwayman, they are responsible for half the troubles of the world and they never had any pity on the Irish, either. Now if you want to know any more poems, Frankie, tell me and I'll get them from the pub and bring 'em back in my head. The girl with the blue dress who's not right in the head suddenly says one day, Would you like a book for to read? and she brings me The Amazing Quest of Mr. Ernest Bliss by E. Phillips Oppenheim, which is all about an Englishman who is fed up and doesn't know what to do with himself every day even though he's so rich he can't count his money. His manservant brings him the morning paper the tea the egg the toast and marmalade and he says, Take it away, life is empty. He can't read his paper, he can't eat his egg, and he pines away. His doctor tells him go and live among the poor in the East End of London and he'll learn to love life, which he does and falls in love with a girl who is poor but honest and very intelligent and they get married and move into his house in the West End which is the rich part because it's easier to help the poor and not be fed up when you're nice and comfortable. Seamus likes me to tell him what I'm reading. He says that story about Mr. Ernest Bliss is a made-up story because no one in his right mind would have to go to a doctor over having too much money and not eating his egg though you never know. It might be like that in England. You'd never find the likes of that in Ireland. If you didn't eat your egg here you'd be carted off to the lunatic asylum or reported to the bishop. I can't wait to go home and tell Malachy about this man who won't eat his egg. Malachy will fall down on the floor laughing because such a thing could never happen. He'll say I'm making it up but when I tell him this story is about an Englishman he'll understand. I can't tell the girl in the blue dress that this story was silly because she might have a fit. She says if you're finished with that book I'll bring you another one because there's a whole box of books left behind by patients from the old days. She brings me a book called Tom Brown's School-Days, which is hard to read, and no end of books by P. G. Wodehouse, who makes me laugh over Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and Jeeves and all the Mulliners. Bertie Wooster is rich but he eats his egg every morning for fear of what Jeeves might say. I wish I could talk to the girl in the blue dress or anyone about the books but I'm afraid the Kerry nurse or Sister Rita might find out and they'd move me to a bigger ward upstairs with fifty empty beds and Famine ghosts galore with green mouths and bony fingers pointing. At night I lie in bed thinking about Tom Brown and his adventures at Rugby School and all the characters in P. G. Wodehouse. I can dream about the red lipped landlord's daughter and the highwayman, and the nurses and nuns can do nothing about it. It's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head. It's August and I'm eleven. I've been in this hospital for two months and I wonder if they'll let me out for Christmas. The Kerry nurse tells me I should get down on my two knees and thank God I'm alive at all at all and not be complaining. I'm not complaining, nurse, I'm only wondering if I'll be home for Christmas. She won't answer me. She tells me behave myself or she'll send Sister Rita up to me and then I'll behave myself. Mam comes to the hospital on my birthday and sends up a package with two chocolate bars and a note with names of people in the lane telling me get better and come home and you're a great soldier, Frankie. The nurse lets me talk to her through the window and it's hard because the windows are high and I have to stand on Seamus's shoulders. I tell Mam I want to go home but she says I'm a bit too weak and surely I'll be out in no time. Seamus says, 'Tis a grand thing to be eleven because any day now you'll be a man shaving and all and ready to get out and get a job and drink your pint good as any man. After fourteen weeks Sister Rita tells me I can go home and aren't I a lucky boy that the day will be the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. She tells me I was a very good patient, except for that little problem with the poem and Patricia Madigan, God rest her, and I'm invited to come back and have a big Christmas dinner in the hospital. Mam comes for me and with my weak legs it takes us a long time to walk to the bus at Union Cross. She says, Take your time. After three and a half months we can spare an hour. People are at their doors on Barrack Road and Roden Lane telling me it's grand to see me back, that I'm a great soldier, a credit to my father and mother. Malachy and Michael run up to me in the lane and say, God, you're walking very slow. Can't you run anymore? It's a bright day and I'm happy till I see Dad sitting in the kitchen with Alphie on his lap and there's an empty feeling in my heart because I know he's out of work again. All along I was sure he had a job, Mam told me he did, and I thought there would be no shortage of food and shoes. He smiles at me and tells Alphie, Och, there's your big brother home from the hospital. Mam tells him what the doctor said, that I'm to have plenty of nourishing food and rest. The doctor said beef would be the right thing for building me up again. Dad nods. Mam makes beef tea from a cube and Malachy and Mike watch me drink it. They say they'd like some too but Mam says go away, ye didn't have the typhoid. She says the doctor wants me to go to bed early. She tried to get rid of the fleas but they're worse than ever with the warm weather we're having. Besides, she says, they won't get much out of you all bones and little skin. I lie in bed and think of the hospital where the white sheets were changed every day and there wasn't a sign of a flea. There was a lavatory where you could sit and read your book till someone asked if you were dead. There was a bath where you could sit in hot water as long as you liked and say, I do believe, Induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy, And saying that helps me fall asleep. When Malachy and Michael get up for school in the morning Mam tells me I can stay in bed. Malachy is in fifth class now with Mr. O'Dea and he likes to tell everyone he's learning the big red catechism for Confirmation and Mr. O'Dea is telling them all about state of grace and Euclid and how the English tormented the Irish for eight hundred long years. I don't want to stay in bed anymore. The October days are lovely and I want to sit outside looking up the lane at the way the sun slants along the wall opposite our house. Mikey Moloney brings me P. G. Wodehouse books his father gets from the library and I have great days with Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and all the Mulliners. Dad lets me read his favorite book, John Mitchel's Jail Journal, which is all about a great Irish rebel the English condemned to exile in Van Diemen's land in Australia. The English tell John Mitchel he's free to come and go as he pleases all over Van Diemen's land if he gives his word of honor as a gentleman he won't try to escape. He gives his word till a ship comes to help him escape and he goes to the office of the English magistrate and says, I'm escaping, jumps on his horse and winds up in New York. Dad says he doesn't mind if I read silly English books by P. G. Wodehouse as long as I don't forget the men who did their bit and gave their lives for Ireland. I can't stay at home forever and Mam takes me back to Leamy's School in November. The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, says he's sorry, I've missed over two months of school and I have to be put back in fifth class. Mam says surely I'm ready for sixth class. After all, she says, he's missed only a few weeks. Mr. O'Halloran says he's sorry, take the boy next door to Mr. O'Dea. We walk along the hallway and I tell Mam I don't want to be in fifth class. Malachy is in that class and I don't want to be in a class with my brother who is a year younger. I made my Confirmation last year. He didn't. I'm older. I'm not bigger anymore because of the typhoid but I'm older. Mam says, It won't kill you. She doesn't care and I'm put into that class with Malachy and I know all his friends are there sneering at me because I was put back. Mr. O'Dea makes me sit in the front and tells me get that sour look off my puss or I'll feel the end of his ash plant. Then a miracle happens and it's all because of St. Francis of Assisi, my favorite saint, and Our Lord Himself. I find a penny in the street that first day back at school and I want to run to Kathleen O'Connell's for a big square of Cleeves' toffee but I can't run because my legs are still weak from the typhoid and sometimes I have to hold on to a wall. I'm desperate for the Cleeves'toffee but I'm also desperate to get out of fifth class. I know I have to go to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi. He's the only one who will listen but he's at the other end of Limerick and it takes me an hour to walk there, sitting on steps, holding on to walls. It's a penny to light a candle and I wonder if I should just light the candle and keep the penny. No, St. Francis would know. He loves the bird in the air and the fish in the stream but he's not a fool. I light the candle, I kneel at his statue and beg him to get me out of fifth class where I'm stuck with my brother, who is probably going around the lane now bragging that his big brother was kept back. St. Francis doesn't say a word but I know he's listening and I know he'll get me out of that class. It's the least he could do after all my trouble coming to his statue, sitting on steps, holding on to walls, when I could have gone to St. Joseph's Church and lit a candle to the Little Flower or the Sacred Heart of Jesus Himself. What's the use of being named after him if he's going to desert me in my hour of need? I have to sit in Mr. O'Dea's class listening to the catechism and all the other stuff he taught last year. I'd like to raise my hand and give the answers but he says, Be quiet, let your brother answer. He gives them tests in arithmetic and makes me sit there and correct them. He dictates to them in Irish and makes me correct what they've written. Then he gives me special compositions to write and makes me read them to the class because of all I learned from him last year. He tells the class, Frank McCourt is going to show you how well he learned to write in this class last year. He's going to write a composition on Our Lord, aren't you, McCourt? He's going to tell us what it would be like if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick which has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family and is the holiest city in Ireland. We know that if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick He would never have been crucified because the people of Limerick were always good Catholics and not given to crucifixion. So, McCourt, you are to go home and write that composition and bring it in tomorrow. Dad says Mr. O'Dea has a great imagination but didn't Our Lord suffer enough on the cross without sticking Him in Limerick on top of it with the damp from the River Shannon. He puts on his cap and goes for a long walk and I have to think about Our Lord by myself and wonder what I'm going to write tomorrow. The next day Mr. O'Dea says, All right, McCourt, read your composition to the class. The name of my composition is- The title, McCourt, the title. The title of my composition is, ""Jesus and the Weather. "" What? ""Jesus and the Weather. "" All right, read it. This is my composition. I don't think Jesus Who is Our Lord would have liked the weather in Limerick because it's always raining and the Shannon keeps the whole city damp. My father says the Shannon is a killer river because it killed my two brothers. When you look at pictures of Jesus He's always wandering around ancient Israel in a sheet. It never rains there and you never hear of anyone coughing or getting consumption or anything like that and no one has a job there because all they do is stand around and eat manna and shake their fists and go to crucifixions. Anytime Jesus got hungry all He had to do was walk up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have His fill. If He wanted a pint He could wave His hand over a big glass and there was the pint. Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister, Martha, and they'd give Him His dinner no questions asked and He'd get his feet washed and dried with Mary Magdalene's hair while Martha washed the dishes, which I don't think is fair. Why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with Our Lord? It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him. The End. Mr. O'Dea is quiet and gives me a strange look and I'm worried because when he's quiet like that it means someone is going to suffer. He says, McCourt, who wrote that composition? I did, sir. Did your father write that composition? He didn't, sir. Come here, McCourt. I follow him out the door, along the hall to the headmaster's room. Mr. O'Dea shows him my composition and Mr. O'Halloran gives me the strange look, too. Did you write this composition? I did, sir. I'm taken out of the fifth class and put into Mr. O'Halloran's sixth class with all the boys I know, Paddy Clohessy, Fintan Slattery, The Question Quigley, and when school is over that day I have to go back down to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi to thank him even if my legs are still weak from the typhoid and I have to sit on steps and hold on to walls and I wonder was it something good I said in that composition or something bad. Mr. Thomas L. O'Halloran teaches three classes in one room, sixth, seventh, eighth. He has a head like President Roosevelt and he wears gold glasses. He wears suits, navy blue or gray, and there's a gold watch chain that hangs across his belly from pocket to pocket in his waistcoat. We call him Hoppy because he has a short leg and hops when he walks. He knows what we call him and he says, Yes, I'm Hoppy and I'll hop on you. He carries a long stick, a pointer, and if you don't pay attention or give a stupid answer he gives you three slaps on each hand or whacks you across the backs of your legs. He makes you learn everything by heart, everything, and that makes him the hardest master in the school. He loves America and makes us know all the American states in alphabetical order. He makes charts of Irish grammar, Irish history and algebra at home, hangs them on an easel and we have to chant our way through the cases, conjugations and declensions of Irish, famous names and battles, proportions, ratios, equations. We have to know all the important dates in Irish history. He tells us what is important and why. No master ever told us why before. If you asked why you'd be hit on the head. Hoppy doesn't call us idiots and if you ask a question he doesn't go into a rage. He's the only master who stops and says, Do ye understand what I'm talking about? Do ye want to ask a question? It's a shock to everyone when he says, the Battle of Kinsale in sixteen nought one was the saddest moment in Irish history, a close battle with cruelty and atrocities on both sides. Cruelty on both sides? The Irish side? How could that be? All the other masters told us the Irish always fought nobly, they always fought the fair fight. He recites and makes us remember, They went forth to battle, but they always fell, Their eyes were fixed above the sullen shields. Nobly they fought and bravely, but not well, And sank heart wounded by a subtle spell. If they lost it was because of traitors and informers. But I want to know about these Irish atrocities. Sir, did the Irish commit atrocities at the Battle of Kinsale? They did, indeed. It is recorded that they killed prisoners but they were no better nor worse than the English. Mr. O'Halloran can't lie. He's the headmaster. All these years we were told the Irish were always noble and they made brave speeches before the English hanged them. Now Hoppy O'Halloran is saying the Irish did bad things. Next thing he'll be saying the English did good things. He says, You have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind about history and everything else but you can't make up an empty mind. Stock your mind, stock your mind. It is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it. If you won the Irish Sweepstakes and bought a house that needed furniture would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish? Your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head. You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace. He calls us one by one to the front of the room and looks at our shoes. He wants to know why they're broken or why we have no shoes at all. He tells us this is a disgrace and he's going to have a raffle to raise money so that we can have strong warm boots for the winter. He gives us books of tickets and we swarm all over Limerick for Leamy's School boot fund, first prize five pounds, five prizes of a pound each. Eleven boys with no boots get new boots. Malachy and I don't get any because we have shoes on our feet even if the soles are worn away and we wonder why we ran all over Limerick selling tickets so that other boys could get boots. Fintan Slattery says we gain plenary Indulgences for works of charity and Paddy Clohessy says, Fintan, would you ever go and have a good shit for yourself. I know when Dad does the bad thing. I know when he drinks the dole money and Mam is desperate and has to beg at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ask for credit at Kathleen O'Connell's shop but I don't want to back away from him and run to Mam. How can I do that when I'm up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep? He lights the fire and makes the tea and sings to himself or reads the paper to me in a whisper that won't wake up the rest of the family. Mikey Molloy stole Cuchulain, the Angel on the Seventh Step is gone someplace else, but my father in the morning is still mine. He gets the Irish Press early and tells me about the world, Hitler, Mussolini, Franco. He says this war is none of our business because the English are up to their tricks again. He tells me about the great Roosevelt in Washington and the great De Valera in Dublin. In the morning we have the world to ourselves and he never tells me I should die for Ireland. He tells me about the old days in Ireland when the English wouldn't let the Catholics have schools because they wanted to keep the people ignorant, that the Catholic children met in hedge schools in the depths of the country and learned English, Irish, Latin and Greek. The people loved learning. They loved stories and poetry even if none of this was any good for getting a job. Men, women and children would gather in ditches to hear those great masters and everyone wondered at how much a man could carry in his head. The masters risked their lives going from ditch to ditch and hedge to hedge because if the English caught them teaching they might be transported to foreign parts or worse. He tells me school is easy now, you don't have to sit in a ditch learning your sums or the glorious history of Ireland. I should be good in school and some day I'll go back to America and get an inside job where I'll be sitting at a desk with two fountain pens in my pocket, one red and one blue, making decisions. I'll be in out of the rain and I'll have a suit and shoes and a warm place to live and what more could a man want? He says you can do anything in America, it's the land of opportunity. You can be a fisherman in Maine or a farmer in California. America is not like Limerick, a gray place with a river that kills. When you have your father to yourself by the fire in the morning you don't need Cuchulain or the Angel on the Seventh Step or anything. At night he helps us with our exercises. Mam says they call it homework in America but here it's exercises, the sums, the English, the Irish, the history. He can't help us with Irish because he's from the North and lacking in the native tongue. Malachy offers to teach him all the Irish words he knows but Dad says it's too late, you can't teach an old dog a new bark. Before bed we sit around the fire and if we say, Dad, tell us a story, he makes up one about someone in the lane and the story will take us all over the world, up in the air, under the sea and back to the lane. Everyone in the story is a different color and everything is upside down and backward. Motor cars and planes go under water and submarines fly through the air. Sharks sit in trees and giant salmon sport with kangaroos on the moon. Polar bears wrestle with elephants in Australia and penguins teach Zulus how to play bagpipes. After the story he takes us upstairs and kneels with us while we say our prayers. We say the Our Father, three Hail Marys, God bless the Pope. God bless Mam, God bless our dead sister and brothers, God bless Ireland, God bless De Valera, and God bless anyone who gives Dad a job. He says, Go to sleep, boys, because holy God is watching you and He always knows if you're not good. I think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland. I feel sad over the bad thing but I can't back away from him because the one in the morning is my real father and if I were in America I could say, I love you, Dad, the way they do in the films, but you can't say that in Limerick for fear you might be laughed at. You're allowed to say you love God and babies and horses that win but anything else is a softness in the head. Day and night we're tormented in that kitchen with people emptying their buckets. Mam says it's not the River Shannon that will kill us but the stink from that lavatory outside our door. It's bad enough in the winter when everything flows over and seeps under our door but worse in the warm weather when there are flies and bluebottles and rats. There is a stable next to the lavatory where they keep the big horse from Gabbett's coal yard. His name is Finn the Horse and we all love him but the stable man from the coal yard doesn't take proper care of the stable and the stink travels to our house. The stink from the lavatory and the stable attracts rats and we have to chase them with our new dog, Lucky. He loves to corner the rats and then we smash them to bits with rocks or sticks or stab them with the hay fork in the stable. The horse himself is frightened by the rats and we have to be careful when he rears up. He knows we're not rats because we bring him apples when we rob an orchard out the country. Sometimes the rats escape and run into our house and into the coal hole under the stairs where it's pitch dark and you can't see them. Even when we bring in a candle we can't find them because they dig holes everywhere and we don't know where to look. If we have a fire we can boil water and pour it slowly in from the kettle spot and that will drive them out of the hole between our legs and out the door again unless Lucky is there to catch them in his teeth and shake the life out of them. We expect him to eat the rats but he'll leave them in the lane with their guts hanging out and run to my father for a piece of bread dipped in tea. People in the lane say that's a peculiar way for a dog to behave but then what would you expect from a dog of the McCourts. The minute there's a sign of a rat or a mention of one Mam is out the door and up the lane. She'd rather walk the streets of Limerick forever than stay one minute in a house that has a rat in it and she can never rest because she knows that with the stable and the lavatory there's always a rat nearby with his family waiting for their dinner. We fight the rats and we fight the stink from that lavatory. We'd like to keep our door open in the warm weather but you can't when people are trotting down the lane to empty their brimming buckets. Some families are worse than others and Dad hates all of them even though Mam tells him it's not their fault if the builders a hundred years ago put up houses with no lavatories but this one outside our door. Dad says the people should empty their buckets in the middle of the night when we are asleep so that we won't be disturbed by the stink. The flies are nearly as bad as the rats. On warm days they swarm to the stable and when a bucket is emptied they swarm to the lavatory. If Mam cooks anything they swarm into the kitchen and Dad says it's disgusting to think the fly sitting there on the sugar bowl was on the toilet bowl, or what's left of it, a minute ago. If you have an open sore they find it and torment you. By day you have the flies, by night you have the fleas. Mam says there's one good thing about fleas, they're clean, but flies are filthy, you never know where they came from and they carry diseases galore. We can chase the rats and kill them. We can slap at the flies and the fleas and kill them but there's nothing we can do about the neighbors and their buckets. If we're out in the lane playing and we see someone with a bucket we call to our own house, Bucket coming, close the door, close the door, and whoever is inside runs to the door. In warm weather we run to close the door all day because we know which families have the worst buckets. There are families whose fathers have jobs and if they get into the habit of cooking with curry we know their buckets will stink to the heavens and make us sick. Now with the war on and men sending money from England more and more families are cooking with curry and our house is filled with the stink day and night. We know the families with the curry, we know the ones with the cabbage. Mam is sick all the time, Dad takes longer and longer walks into the country, and we play outside as much as we can and far from the lavatory. Dad doesn't complain about the River Shannon anymore. He knows now the lavatory is worse and he takes me with him to the Town Hall to complain. The man there says, Mister, all I can tell you is you can move. Dad says we can't afford to move and the man says there's nothing he can do. Dad says, This is not India. This is a Christian country. The lane needs more lavatories. The man says, Do you expect Limerick to start building lavatories in houses that are falling down anyway, that will be demolished after the war? Dad says that lavatory could kill us all. The man says we live in dangerous times. Mam says it's hard enough keeping a fire going to cook the Christmas dinner but if I'm going to Christmas dinner at the hospital I'll have to wash myself from top to bottom. She wouldn't give it to Sister Rita to say I was neglected or ripe for another disease. She boils a pot of water early in the morning before Mass and nearly scalds the scalp off me. She scours my ears and scrubs my skin so hard it tingles. She can afford tuppence for the bus out to the hospital but I'll have to walk back and that will be good for me because I'll be stuffed with food and now she has to get the fire going again for the pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes which she got once again through the kindness of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and she's determined this will be the last time we celebrate the birth of Our Lord with pig's head. Next year we'll have a goose or a nice ham and why wouldn't we, isn't Limerick famous the world over for the ham? Sister Rita says, Now would you look at this, our little soldier looking so healthy. No meat on the bones but still. Now tell me, did you go to Mass this morning? I did, Sister. And did you receive? I did, Sister. She takes me into an empty ward and tells me sit there on that chair it won't be long now till I get my dinner. She leaves and I wonder if I'll be eating with nuns and nurses or will I be in a ward with children having their Christmas dinner. In awhile my dinner is brought in by the girl in the blue dress who brought me the books. She places the tray on the side of a bed and I pull up a chair. She frowns at me and screws up her face. You, she says, that's your dinner an' I'm not bringin' you any books. The dinner is delicious, turkey, mashed potatoes, peas, jelly and custard, and a pot of tea. The jelly and custard dish looks delicious and I can't resist it so I'll have it first there's no one there to notice but when I'm eating it the girl in the blue dress comes in with bread and says, What are you doin'? Nothing. Yes, you are. You're atin' the sweet before the dinner, and she runs out calling, Sister Rita, Sister Rita, come in quick, and the nun rushes in, Francis, are you all right? I am, Sister. He's not all right, Sister. He do be atin' his jelly an custard before his dinner. That's a sin, Sister. Ah, now, dear, you run along and I'll talk to Francis about that. Do, Sister, talk to him or all the childer in the hospital will be atin' their sweet before their dinner an' then where will we be? Indeed, indeed, where will we be? Run along now. The girl leaves and Sister Rita smiles at me. God love her, she doesn't miss a thing even in her confusion. We have to be patient with her, Francis, the way she's touched. She leaves and it's quiet in that empty ward and when I'm finished I don't know what to do because you're not supposed to do anything till they tell you. Hospitals and schools always tell you what to do. I wait a long time till the girl in the blue dress comes in for the tray. Are you finished? she says. and I tells I am. Well, that's all you're gettin' an' now you can go home. Surely girls who are not right in the head can't tell you go home wonder if I should wait for Sister Rita. A nurse in the hallway me Sister Rita is having her dinner and is not to be bothered. It's a long walk from Union Cross to Barrack Hill and when I get home my family are up in Italy and well into their pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes. I tell them about my Christmas dinner. Mam wants to know if I had it with the nurses and nuns and she gets a bit angry when I tell her I ate alone in a ward and that's no way to treat a child. She tells me sit down and have some pig's head and I force it into my mouth and I'm so stuffed I have to lie on the bed with my belly sticking out a mile. It's early in the morning and there's a motor car outside our door, the first one we've ever seen in the lane. There are men in suits looking in the door of the stable of Finn the Horse and there must be something wrong because you never see men with suits in the lane. It's Finn the Horse. He's lying on the floor of the stable looking up the lane and there's white stuff like milk around his mouth. The stable man who takes care of Finn the Horse says he found him like that this morning and it's strange because he's always up and ready for his feed. The men are shaking their heads. My brother Michael says to one of the men, Mister, what's up with Finn? Sick horse, son. Go home. The stable man who takes care of Finn has the whiskey smell on him. He says to Michael, That horse is a goner. We have to shoot him. Michael pulls at my hand. Frank, they're not to shoot him. Tell them. You're big. The stable man says, Go home, boy. Go home. Michael attacks him, kicks him, scrawbs the back of his hand, and the man sends Michael flying. Hould that brother of yours, he tells me, hould him. One of the other men takes something yellow and brown from a bag, goes to Finn, puts it to his head and there's a sharp crack. Finn shivers. Michael screams at the man and attacks him too but the man says, The horse was sick, son. He's better off. The men in suits drive away and the stable man says he has to wait for the lorry to take Finn away, he can't leave him alone or the rats will be at him. He wants to know if we'd keep an eye on the horse with our dog Lucky while he goes to the pub, he's blue mouldy for a pint. No rat has a chance to get near Finn the Horse the way Michael is there with a stick small as he is. The man comes back smelling of porter and then there's the big lorry to take the horse away, a big lorry with three men and two great planks that slope from the back of the lorry to Finn's head. The three men and the stable man tie ropes around Finn and pull him up the planks and the people in the lane yell at the men because of the nails and broken wood in the planks that catch at Finn and tear out bits of his hide and streak the planks with bright pink horse blood. Ye are destroyin' that horse. Can't ye have respect for the dead? Go easy with that poor horse. The stable man says, For the love o' Jaysus what are ye squawkin' about? 'Tis only a dead horse, and Michael runs at him again with his head down and his small fists flying till the stable man gives him a shove that sends him on his back and Mam goes at the stable man in such a rage he runs up the planks and over Finn's body to escape. He comes back drunk in the evening to sleep it off and after he leaves there's a smoldering in the hay and the stable burns down the rats running up the lane with every boy and dog chasing them till they escape into the streets of respectable people. IX Mam says, Alphie is enough. I'm worn out. That's the end of it. No more children. Dad says, The good Catholic woman must perform her wifely duties and submit to her husband or face eternal damnation. Mam says, As long as there are no more children eternal damnation sounds attractive enough to me. What is Dad to do? There's a war on. English agents are recruiting Irishmen to work in their munitions factories, the pay is good, there are no jobs in Ireland, and if the wife turns her back to you there's no shortage of women in England where the able men are off fighting Hitler and Mussolini and you can do anything you like as long as you remember you're Irish and lower class and don't try to rise above your station. Families up and down the lane are getting telegram money orders from their fathers in England. They rush to the post office to cash the money orders so they can shop and show the world their good fortune on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The boys get their hair cut on Saturdays, the women curl their hair with iron tongs hot from the fire. They're very grand now the way they pay sixpence or even a shilling for seats at the Savoy Cinema where you'll meet a better class of people than the lower classes who fill the tuppenny seats in the gods at the Lyric Cinema and are never done shouting at the screen, the kind of people if you don't mind who are liable to cheer on the Africans when they throw spears at Tarzan or the Indians when they're scalping the United States Cavalry. The new rich people go home after Mass on Sundays all airs and stuff themselves with meat and potatoes, sweets and cakes galore, and they think nothing of drinking their tea from delicate little cups which stand in saucers to catch the tea that overflows and when they lift the cups they stick out their little fingers to show how refined they are. Some stop going to fish and chip shops altogether because you see nothing in those places but drunken soldiers and night girls and men that drank their dole and their wives screeching at them to come home. The brave new rich will be seen at the Savoy Restaurant or the Stella drinking tea, eating little buns, patting their lips with serviettes if you don't mind, coming home on the bus and complaining the service is not what it used to be. They have electricity now so they can see things they never saw before and when darkness falls they turn on the new wireless to hear how the war is going. They thank God for Hitler because if he hadn't marched all over Europe the men of Ireland would still be at home scratching their arses on the queue at the Labour Exchange. Some families sing, Yip aye aidy aye ay aye oh Yip aye aidy aye ay, We don't care about England or France, All we want is the German advance. If there's a chill in the air they'll turn on the electric fire for the comfort that's in it and sit in their kitchens listening to the news declaring how sorry they are for the English women and children dying under the German bombs but look what England did to us for eight hundred years. The families with fathers in England are able to lord it over the families that don't. At dinnertime and teatime the new rich mothers stand at their doors and call to their children, Mikey, Kathleen, Paddy, come in for yeer dinner. Come in for the lovely leg o'lamb and the gorgeous green peas and the floury white potatoes. Sean, Josie, Peggy, come in for yeer tea, come in at wanst for the fresh bread and butter and the gorgeous blue duck egg what no one else in the lane have. Brendan, Annie, Patsy, come in for the fried black puddin', the sizzlin' sausages and the lovely trifle soaked in the best of Spanish sherry. At times like this Mam tells us to stay inside. We have nothing but bread and tea and she doesn't want the tormenting neighbors to see us with our tongues hanging out, suffering over the lovely smells floating up and down the lane. She says 'tis easy to see they're not used to having anything the way they brag about everything. 'Tis a real low-class mind that will call out the door and tell the world what they're having for the supper. She says 'tis their way of getting a rise out of us because Dad is a foreigner from the North and he won't have anything to do with any of them. Dad says all that food comes from English money and no luck will come to those who took it but what could you expect from Limerick anyway, people who profit from Hitler's war, people who will work and fight for the English. He says he'll never go over there and help England win a war. Mam says, No, you'll stay here where there's no work and hardly a lump of coal to boil water for the tea. No, you'll stay here and drink the dole when the humor is on you. You'll watch your sons going around with broken shoes and their arses hanging out of their trousers. Every house in the lane has electricity and we're lucky if we have a candle. God above, if I had the fare I'd be off to England myself for I'm sure they need women in the factories. Dad says a factory is no place for a woman. Mam says, Sitting on your arse by the fire is no place for a man. I say to him, Why can't you go to England, Dad, so we can have electricity and a wireless and Mam can stand at the door and tell the world what we're having at dinnertime? He says, Don't you want to have your father here at home with you? I do but you can come back at the end of the war and we can all go to America. He sighs, Och, aye, och, aye. All right he'll go to England after Christmas because America is in the war now and the cause must be just. He'd never go if the Americans hadn't gone in. He tells me I'll have to be the man of the house, and he signs up with an agent to work in a factory in Coventry which, everyone says, is the most bombed city in England. The agent says, There's plenty of work for willing men. You can work overtime till you drop and if you save it up, mate, you'll be Rockefeller at the end of the war. We're up early to see Dad off at the railway station. Kathleen O'Connell at the shop knows Dad is off to England and money will be flowing back so she's happy to let Mam have credit for tea, milk, sugar, bread, butter and an egg. An egg. Mam says, This egg is for your father. He needs the nourishment for the long journey before him. It's a hard-boiled egg and Dad peels off the shell. He slices the egg five ways and gives each of us a bit to put on our bread. Mam says, Don't be such a fool. Dad says, What would a man be doing with a whole egg to himself? Mam has tears on her eyelashes. She pulls her chair over to the fireplace. We all eat our bread and egg and watch her cry till she says, What are ye gawkin' at? and turns away to look into the ashes. Her bread and egg are still on the table and I wonder if she has any plans for them. They look delicious and I'm still hungry but Dad gets up and brings them to her with the tea. She shakes her head but he presses them on her and she eats and drinks, snuffling and crying. He sits opposite her a while, silent, till she looks up at the clock and says, 'Tis time to go. He puts on his cap and picks up his bag. Mam wraps Alphie in an old blanket and we set off through the streets of Limerick. There are other families in the streets. The going away fathers walk ahead, the mothers carry babies or push prams. A mother with a pram will say to other mothers, God above, missus, you must be fagged out carrying that child. Sure, why don't you stick him into the pram here and rest your poor arms. Prams might be packed with four or five babies squalling away because the prams are old and the wheels bockety and the babies are rocked till they get sick and throw up their goody. The men call to each other. Grand day, Mick. Lovely day for the journey, Joe. 'Tis, indeed, Mick. Arrah, we might as well have a pint before we go, Joe. We might as well, Mick. Might as well be drunk as the way we are, Joe. They laugh and the women behind them are teary eyed and red nosed. In the pubs around the railway station the men are packed in drinking the money the agents gave them for travel food. They're having the last pint, the last drop of whiskey on Irish soil, For God knows it might be the last we'll ever have, Mick, the way the Jerries are bombing the bejesus outa England and not a minute too soon after what they did to us and isn't it a tragic thing entirely the way we have to go over there and save the arse of the ancient foe. The women stay outside the pubs talking. Mam tells Mrs. Meehan, The first telegram money order I get I'll be in the shop buying a big breakfast so that we can all have our own egg of a Sunday morning. I look at my brother Malachy. Did you hear that? Our own egg of a Sunday morning. Oh, God, I already had plans for my egg. Tap it around the top, gently crack the shell, lift with a spoon, a dab of butter down into the yolk, salt, take my time, a dip of the spoon, scoop, more salt, more butter, into the mouth, oh, God above, if heaven has a taste it must be an egg with butter and salt, and after the egg is there anything in the world lovelier than fresh warm bread and a mug of sweet golden tea? Some men are already too drunk to walk and the English agents are paying sober men to drag them out of the pubs and throw them on a great horse drawn float to be hauled to the station and dumped into the train. The agents are desperate to get everyone out of the pubs. Come on, men. Miss this train and you'll miss a good job. Come on, men, we have the Guinness in England. We have the Jameson. Now, men, please, men. You're drinking your food money and you'll get no more. The men tell the agents to kiss their Irish arses, that the agents are lucky they're alive, lucky they're not hanging from the nearest lamppost after what they did to Ireland. And the men sing, On Mountjoy one Monday morning High upon the gallows tree, Kevin Barry gave his young life For the cause of liberty. The train wails in the station and the agents beg the women to get their men out of the pubs and the men stumble out singing and crying and hugging their wives and children and promising to send so much money Limerick will be turned into another New York. The men climb the station steps and the women and children call after them, Kevin, love, mind yourself and don't be wearing damp shirts. Dry your socks, Michael, or the bunions will destroy you entirely. Paddy, go easy on the drink, are you listenin', Paddy? Dad, Dad, don't go, Dad. Tommy, don't forget to send the money. The children are skin and bones. Peter, don't forget to be takin' the medicine for your weak chest, God help us. Larry, mind them bloody bombs. Christy, don't be talkin' to them Englishwomen. They're full of diseases. Jackie, come back. Sure we'll manage somehow. Don't go, Jack-e-e, Jack-e-e, oh, Jesus, don't go. Dad pats our heads. He tells us remember our religious duties but, above all, obey our mother. He stands before her. She has the baby Alphie in her arms. She says, Mind yourself. He drops the bag and puts his arms around her. They stay that way a moment till the baby yelps between them. He nods, picks up his bag, climbs the steps to the station, turns to wave and he's gone. Back at home Mam says, I don't care. I know it sounds extravagant but I'm going to light the fire and make more tea for it isn't every day your father goes to England. We sit around the fire and drink our tea and cry because we have no father, till Mam says, Don't cry, don't cry. Now that your father is gone to England surely our troubles will be over. Surely. Mam and Bridey Hannon sit by the fire upstairs in Italy smoking Woodbines, drinking tea, and I sit on the stairs listening. We have a father in England so that we can get all we want from Kathleen O'Connell's shop and pay when he starts sending the money in a fortnight. Mam tells Bridey she can't wait to get out of this bloody lane to a place with a decent lavatory that we don't have to share with half the world. We'll all have new boots and coats to keep off the rain so we won't be coming home from school famished. We'll have eggs and rashers on Sunday for breakfast and ham and cabbage and potatoes for dinner. We'll have electric light and why shouldn't we? Weren't Frank and Malachy born to it in America where everyone has it? All we have to do now is wait for two weeks till the telegram boy knocks at the door. Dad will have to settle into his job in England, buy work clothes and get a place to stay, so the first money order won't be big, three pounds or three pounds ten, but soon we'll be like other families in the lane, five pounds a week, paying off debts, buying new clothes, putting something in the savings against the time we'll pack up and move to England entirely and save there to go to America. Mam herself could get a job in an English factory making bombs or something and God knows we wouldn't know ourselves with the money pouring in. She wouldn't be happy if we grew up with English accents but better an English accent than an empty belly. Bridey says it doesn't matter what class of an accent an Irishman has for he'll never forget what the English did to us for eight hundred long years. We know what Saturdays are in the lane. We know some families like the Downeses across from us get their telegram early because Mr. Downes is a steady man who knows how to have a pint or two on a Friday and go home to his bed. We know men like him run to the post office the minute they're paid so their families won't know a minute of waiting or worry. Men like Mr. Downes send their sons RAF wings to wear on their coats. That's what we want and that's what we told Dad before he left, Don't forget the RAF badges, Dad. We see the telegram boys on their bicycles swing into the lane. They're happy telegram boys because the tips they get in the lanes are bigger than anything they get in the grand streets and avenues where rich people will begrudge you the steam of their piss. The families that get the early telegrams have that contented look. They'll have all day Saturday to enjoy the money. They'll shop, they'll eat, they'll have all day to think about what they'll do that night and that's almost as good as the thing itself because Saturday night when you have a few shillings in your pocket is the most delicious night of the week. There are families don't get the telegram every week and you know them by the anxious look. Mrs. Meagher has waited at her door every Saturday for two months. My mother says she'd be ashamed of her life to wait at the door like that. All the children play in the lane and keep an eye out for the telegram boy. Hoi, telegram boy, do you have anything for Meagher? and when he says no they say, Are you sure? and he'll say, Course I'm sure. I know what I have in my feckin' pouch. Everyone knows the telegram boys stop coming when the Angelus rings at six and darkness brings desperation to the women and children. Telegram boy, will you look in your pouch again? Please. Aw, God. I did. I have nothing for ye. Aw, God, please look. Our name is Meagher. Will you look? I know bloody well yeer name is Meagher and I looked. The children claw at him up on his bicycle and he kicks at them, Jesus, will ye get away from me. Once the Angelus rings at six in the evening the day is over. The ones with the telegrams are having their supper with the electric light blazing away and the ones that didn't get the telegrams have to light candles and see if Kathleen O'Connell might let them have tea and bread till this time next week when surely with the help of God and His Blessed Mother the telegram will come. Mr. Meehan at the top of the lane went to England with Dad and when the telegram boy stops at Meehan's we know we'll be next. Mam has her coat ready to go to the post office but she won't leave the chair by the fire in Italy till she has the telegram in her hand. The telegram boy rides down the lane and swings over to Downeses'. He hands them their telegram, takes the tip and turns his bicycle around to head back up the lane. Malachy calls, Telegram boy, do you have something for McCourt? Ours is coming today. The telegram boy shakes his head and rides away. Mam puffs on her Woodbine. Well, we have all day though I'd like to do a bit of shopping early before the best hams are gone at Barry the butcher. She can't leave the fire and we can't leave the lane for fear the telegram boy might come and find no one at home. Then we'd have to wait till Monday to cash the money order and that would destroy the weekend entirely. We'd have to watch the Meehans and everyone else parading around in their new clothes and staggering home with eggs and potatoes and sausages for Sunday and sailing off to the films on Saturday night. No, we can't move an inch till that telegram boy comes. Mam says don't be too worried between noon and two because so many telegram boys go for their dinner and there will surely be a big rush between two and the Angelus. We don't have a thing to worry about till six. We stop every telegram boy. We tell them our name is McCourt, that this is our first telegram, it should be three pounds or more, they might have forgotten to put our name on it or our address, is he sure? is he sure? One boy tells us he'll inquire at the post office. He says he knows what 'tis like to wait for the telegram because his own father is a drunken oul' shit over in England that never sent a penny. Mam hears him inside and tells us you should never talk about your father like that. The same telegram boy comes back just before the Angelus at six and tells us he asked Mrs. O'Connell at the post office if they had anything for McCourt all day and they didn't. Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael who is only five and won't understand anything till he's eleven like me wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane. You don't know what to do with yourself when the first telegram doesn't come. You can't stay out in the lane playing with your brothers all night because everyone else is gone in and you'd be ashamed to stay out in the lane to be tormented with smells of sausages and rashers and fried bread. You don't want to look at electric light coming through the windows after dark and you don't want to hear the news from the BBC or Radio Eireann from other people's wirelesses. Mrs. Meagher and her children are gone in and there's only the dim light of a candle from their kitchen. They're ashamed too. They stay inside on Saturday nights and they don't even go to Mass on Sunday mornings. Bridey Hannon told Mam that Mrs. Meagher is in a constant state of shame over the rags they wear and so desperate she goes down to the Dispensary for the public assistance. Mam says that's the worst thing that could happen to any family. It's worse than going on the dole, it's worse than going to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, it's worse than begging on the streets with the tinkers and the knackers. It's the last thing you'd do to keep yourself out of the poor house and the children from the orphanage. There's a sore at the top of my nose between my eyebrows, gray and red and itching. Grandma says, Don't touch that sore and don't put water near it or it'll spread. If you broke your arm she'd say don't touch that with water it'll spread. The sore spreads into my eyes anyway and now they're red and yellow from the stuff that oozes and makes them stick in the morning. They stick so hard I have to force my eyelids open with my fingers and Mam has to scrub off that yellow stuff with a damp rag and boric powder. The eyelashes fall off and every bit of dust in Limerick blows into my eyes on windy days. Grandma tells me I have naked eyes and she says it's my own fault, all that eye trouble comes from sitting up there at the top of the lane under the light pole in all kinds of weather with my nose stuck in books and the same thing will happen to Malachy if he doesn't give over with the reading. You can see little Michael is getting just as bad sticking his nose in books when he should be out playing like a healthy child. Books, books, books, says Grandma, ye will ruin yeer eyes entirely. She's having tea with Mam and I hear her whisper, The thing to do is give him St. Anthony's spit. What's that? says Mam. Your fasting spit in the morning. Go to him before he wakes and spit on his eyes for the spit of a fasting mother has powerful cures in it. But I'm always awake before Mam. I force my eyes open long before she stirs. I can hear her coming across the floor and when she stands over me for the spit I open my eyes. God, she says, your eyes are open. I think they're getting better. That's good, and she goes back to bed. The eyes don't heal and she takes me to the Dispensary where the poor people see doctors and get their medicines. It's the place to apply for public assistance when a father is dead or disappeared and there's no dole money, no wages. There are benches along the walls by the doctors' offices. The benches are always packed with people talking about their ailments. Old men and women sit and groan and babies scream and mothers say hush, love, hush. There's a high platform in the middle of the Dispensary with a counter circling it chest high. When you want anything you stand in a queue before that platform to see Mr. Coffey or Mr. Kane. The women in the queue are like the women at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. They wear shawls and they're respectful to Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane because if they're not they might be told go away and come back next week when it's this minute you need the public assistance or a docket to see the doctor. Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane love to have a good laugh with the women. They'll decide if you're desperate enough for the public assistance or if you're sick enough to see a doctor. You have to tell them in front of everyone what's wrong with you and they often have a good laugh with that. They'll say, And what is it you want, Mrs. O'Shea? A docket for the doctor, is it? And what is your trouble, Mrs. O'Shea? A pain, is it? A touch of the wind, maybe. Or maybe too much cabbage. Oh, the cabbage will do it right enough. They laugh and Mrs. O'Shea laughs and all the women laugh and say Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane are funny men, they'd give Laurel and Hardy a run for their money. Mr. Coffey says, Now, woman, what's your name? Angela McCourt, sir. And what's up with you? 'Tis my son, sir. He has two bad eyes. Oh, by God, he does, woman. They're desperate looking eyes altogether. They look like two rising suns. The Japs could use him on their flag, ha ha ha. Did he pour acid on his face or what? 'Tis some class of infection, sir. He had the typhoid last year and then this came. All right, all right, we don't need the life story. Here's your docket to Dr. Troy. Two long benches are filled with patients for Dr. Troy. Mam sits next to a woman who has a big sore on her nose that won't go away. I tried everything, missus, every known cure on God's lovely earth. I'm eighty-three years of age and I'd like to go to my grave healthy. Is it too much to ask that I meet my Redeemer with a healthy nose? And what's up with yourself, missus? My son. The eyes. Ah, God bless us and save us, look at them eyes. They're the sorest two eyes I ever seen in me life. I never seen that color red before. 'Tis an infection, missus. Sure there's a cure for that. You need the caul. What's that now? Babies are born with this thing on their heads, a class of a hood, rare and magical. Get a caul and put that on his head any day that has a three in it, make him hold his breath for three minutes even if you have to clap your hand over his face, sprinkle him with holy water three times head to toenail and his two eyes will shine in the dawn. And where would I get a caul? Don't all the midwives have cauls, missus. What's a midwife without a caul? It cures all classes of disease and keeps off more. Mam says she'll talk to Nurse O'Halloran and see if she has a spare caul. Dr. Troy looks at my eyes. Into the hospital with this boy at once. Take him to the eye ward at the City Home. Here's the docket to get him in. What does he have, Doctor? The worst case of conjunctivitis I've ever seen in my life and something else in there I can't make out. He needs the eye man. How long will he be in, Doctor? Only God knows that. I should have seen this child weeks ago. There are twenty beds in the ward and there are men and boys with bandages around their heads, black patches on their eyes, thick glasses. Some walk around tapping at beds with sticks. A man cries all the time that he'll never see again, he's too young, his children are babies, he'll never see them again. Jesus Christ, oh, Jesus Christ, and the nuns are shocked at the way he takes the name of the Lord in vain. Stop that, Maurice, stop the blasphemy. You have your health. You're alive. We all have our problems. Offer it up and think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the nails in His poor hands and feet, the wound in His side. Maurice says, Oh, Jesus, look down and have pity on me. Sister Bernadette warns him if he doesn't mind his language they'll put him in a ward alone and he says, Heavenly God, and that isn't as bad as Jesus Christ so she's satisfied. In the morning I have to go downstairs for drops. The nurse says, Sit in this high chair and here's a nice sweet. The doctor has a bottle with brown stuff in it. He tells me put my head back, that's right, now open up, open your eyes and he pours the stuff into my right eye and it's a flame going through my skull. The nurse says, Open the other eye, come on be a good boy, and she has to force the eyelids open so the doctor can set fire to the other side of my skull. She wipes my cheeks and tells me run along upstairs but I can barely see and I want to stick my face into an icy stream. The doctor says, Run along, be a man, be a good trooper. The whole world is brown and blurry on the stairs. The other patients are sitting by their beds with dinner trays and mine is there too but I don't want it with the way my skull is raging. I sit by my bed and a boy across the way says, Hoi, don't you want your dinner? I'll take it, and he comes for it. I try to lie on the bed but a nurse says, Now, now, no lying on the bed in the middle of the day. Your case isn't that serious. I have to sit with my eyes closed and everything going brown and black, black and brown and I'm sure I must be having a dream because Lord God above, is that the little fella with the typhoid, little Frankie, the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, is that yourself, Frankie, for wasn't I promoted out of the Fever Hospital, thank God, where there's every class of disease and you never know what germs you might be bringing home to the wife in your clothes and what's up with you, Frankie, and the two eyes in your head all gone brown? I have an infection, Seamus. Yerra, you'll be over that before you're married, Frankie. The eyes need exercise. The blink is great value for the eyes. I had an uncle with bad eyes and the blink saved him. He sat an hour ever day and blinked and it stood to him in the end. Wound up with powerful eyes, so he did. I want to ask him more about the blink and the powerful eyes but he says, Now do you remember the poem, Frankie, the lovely poem of Patricia? He stands in the aisle between the beds with his mop and his bucket and says the highwayman poem and all the patients stop their moaning and the nuns and nurses stand and listen and on and on goes Seamus till he comes to the end and everyone goes mad clapping and cheering him and he tells the world he loves that poem he'll have it in his head forever no matter where he goes and if it wasn't for Frankie McCourt and his typhoid there and poor Patricia Madigan with the dipteria that's gone God rest her he'd never know the poem and there I am famous in the eye ward of the City Home Hospital and all because of Seamus. Mam can't come to visit every day, it's a long way out, she doesn't always have the money for the bus and the walk is hard on her corns. She thinks my eyes look better though you can't tell with all that brown stuff, which looks and smells like iodine and if it's anything like iodine it must burn. Still, they say the bitterer the medicine the quicker the cure. She gets permission to take me for a walk around the grounds when the weather clears and there's a strange sight, Mr. Timoney standing against the wall where the old people are with his eyes raised to the sky. I want to talk to him and I have to ask Mam because you never know what's right or wrong in a hospital. Mr. Timoney. Who is it? Who do we have? Frank McCourt, sir. Francis, ah, Francis. Mam says, I'm his mother, Mr. Timoney. Well, then, the two of ye are blessed. I have neither kith nor kin nor Macushla my dog. And what are you doing in this place, Francis? I have an infection in my eyes. Ah, Jesus, Francis, not the eyes, not the eyes. Mother of Christ, you're too young for that. Mr. Timoney, would you like me to read to you? With them eyes, Francis? Ah, no, son, Save the eyes. I'm beyond reading. In my head I have everything I need. I was smart enough to put things in my head in my youth and now I have a library in my head. The English shot my wife. The Irish put down my poor innocent Macushla. Isn't it a joke of a world? Mam says, Terrible world but God is good. Indeed, missus. God made the world, it's a terrible world, but God is good. Good-bye, Francis. Rest your eyes and then read till they fall out of your head. We had good times with old Jonathan Swift, didn't we, Francis? We did, Mr. Timoney. Mam takes me back to the eye ward. She tells me, Don't be crying over Mr. Timoney, he's not even your father. Besides you'll be ruining your eyes. Seamus comes to the ward three times a week and brings new poems in his head. He says, You made Patricia sad, Frankie, when you didn't like the one about the owl and the pussycat. I'm sorry, Seamus. I have it in my head, Frankie, and I'll say it for you if you don't say 'tis foolish. I won't, Seamus. He says the poem and everyone in the ward loves it. They want the words and he says it three more times till the whole ward is saying, The Owl and the Pussy cat went to sea In a beautiful pea-green boat. They took some honey, and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note. The Owl looked up to the stars above, And sang to a small guitar, O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are. What a beautiful Pussy you are. They say it along with Seamus now and when it's finished they cheer and clap and Seamus laughs, delighted with himself. When he's gone with his mop and bucket you can hear them at all hours of the day and night O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are. What a beautiful Pussy you are. Then Seamus comes with no mop and no bucket and I'm afraid he's sacked over the poetry but he's smiling and telling me he's off to England to work in a factory and earn decent wages for a change. He'll work for two months and bring the wife over and God might be pleased to send them children for he has to do something with all the poems in his head and what better than saying them to small ones in memory of that sweet Patricia Madigan dead of the dipteria. Good-bye, Francis. If I had the right fist I'd write to you but I'll get the wife to write when she comes over. I might even learn to read and write myself so that the child that comes won't have a fool for a father. I want to cry but you can't cry in the eye ward with brown stuff in your eyes and nurses saying, What's this what's this be a man, and nuns going on, Offer it up, think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the lance in the side, the hands and feet torn to bits with nails. I'm a month in the hospital and the doctor says I can go home even if there's still a bit of infection but if I keep the eyes clean with soap and clean towels and build up my health with nourishing food plenty of beef and eggs I'll have a pair of sparkling eyes in no time ha ha. Mr. Downes across the way comes back from England for his mother's funeral. He tells Mrs. Downes about my father. She tells Bridey Hannon and Bridey tells my mother. Mr. Downes says that Malachy McCourt is gone pure mad with the drink, that he squanders his wages in pubs all over Coventry, that he sings Irish rebel songs which the English don't mind because they're used to the way the Irish carry on about the hundreds of years of suffering, but they won't put up with any man that stands up in a pub and insults the King and Queen of England, their two lovely daughters and the Queen Mother herself. Insulting the Queen Mother is going beyond the beyonds. What did she ever do to anyone, that poor old lady? Time after time Malachy drinks away his rent money and winds up sleeping in parks when the landlord throws him out. He's a regular disgrace, so he is, and Mr. Downes is glad McCourt is not a Limerickman bringing shame to this ancient city. The magistrates in Coventry are losing their patience and if Malachy McCourt doesn't stop the bloody nonsense he'll be kicked out of the country entirely. Mam tells Bridey she doesn't know what she's going to do with these stories from England, she never felt so desperate in her life. She can see Kathleen O'Connell doesn't want to give any more credit at the shop and her own mother barks at her if she asks for the loan of a shilling and the St. Vincent de Paul Society want to know when she'll stop asking for charity especially with a husband in England. She's ashamed of the way we look with the dirty old torn shirts, raggedy ganseys, broken shoes, holes in our stockings. She lies awake at night thinking the most merciful thing of all would be to put the four boys in an orphanage so that she could go to England herself and find some type of work where she could bring us all over in a year for the better life. There might be bombs but she'd prefer bombs anytime to the shame of begging from this one and that one. No, no matter what she can't bear the thought of putting us in the orphanage. That might be all right if you had the likes of Boys' Town in America with a nice priest like Spencer Tracy but you could never trust the Christian Brothers out in Glin who get their exercise beating boys and starving the life out of them. Mam says there's nothing left but the Dispensary and the public assistance, the relief, and she's ashamed of her life to go and ask for it. It means you're at the end of your rope and maybe one level above tinkers, knackers and street beggars in general. It means you have to crawl before Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane and thank God the Dispensary is at the other end of Limerick so that people in our lane won't know we're getting the relief. She knows from other women it's wise to be there early in the morning when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane might be in a good mood. If you go late in the morning they're liable to be cranky after seeing hundreds of men women and children sick and asking for help. She will take us with her to prove she has four children to feed. She gets us up early and tells us for once in our lives don't wash our faces, don't comb our hair, dress in any old rag. She tells me give my sore eyes a good rub and make them as red as I can for the worse you look at the Dispensary the more pity you get and the better your chances of getting the public assistance. She complains that Malachy Michael and Alphie look too healthy and you'd wonder why on this day of days they couldn't have their usual scabby knees or the odd cut bruise or black eye. If we meet anyone in the lane or the streets of Limerick we are not to tell them where we're going. She feels ashamed enough without telling the whole world and wait till her own mother hears. There is a queue already outside the Dispensary. There are women like Mam with children in their arms, babies like Alphie, and children playing on the pavement. The women comfort the babies against the cold and scream at the ones playing in case they run into the street and get hit by a motor car or a bicycle. There are old men and women huddled against the wall talking to themselves or not talking at all. Mam warns us not to wander from her and we wait half an hour for the big door to open. A man tells us move inside in proper order and queue up before the platform, that Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane will be there in a minute when they finish their tea in the room beyond. A woman complains her children are freezing with the cold and couldn't Coffey and Kane bloody well hurry up with their tea. The man says she's a troublemaker but he won't take her name this time with the cold that's in the morning but if there's another word she'll be a sorry woman. Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane get up on the platform and pay no attention to the people. Mr. Kane puts on his glasses, takes them off, polishes them, puts them on, looks at the ceiling. Mr. Coffey reads papers, writes something, passes papers to Mr. Kane. They whisper to each other. They take their time. They don't look at us. Then Mr. Kane calls the first old man to the platform. What's your name? Timothy Creagh, sir. Creagh, hah? A fine old Limerick name you have there. I do, sir. Indeed I do. And what do you want, Creagh? Ah, sure, I do be havin' them pains in me stomach again an' I'd like to see Dr. Feeley. Well, now, Creagh, are you sure it's not the pints of porter that are going against your stomach. Ah, no, indeed, sir. Sure I hardly touch the pint at all with the pains. My wife is home in the bed and I have to take care of her too. There's great laziness in the world, Creagh. And Mr. Kane says to the people on the queue, Did ye hear that, ladies? Great laziness, isn't there? And the women say, Oh, there is, indeed, Mr. Kane, great laziness. Mr. Creagh gets his docket to see the doctor, the queue moves ahead and Mr. Kane is ready for Mam. The public assistance, is 'Tis, Mr. Kane. And where's your husband? Oh, he's in England, but- England, is it? And where that what you want, woman, the relief? is the weekly telegram, the big five pounds? He didn't send us a penny in months, Mr. Kane. Is that a fact? Well, we know why, don't we? We know what the men of Ireland are up to in England. We know there's the occasional Limerickman seen trotting around with a Piccadilly tart, don't we? He looks out at the people on the queue and they know they're supposed to say, We do, Mr. Kane, and they know they're supposed to smile and laugh or things will go hard with them when they reach the platform. They know he might turn them over to Mr. Coffey and he's notorious for saying no to everything. Mam tells Mr. Kane that Dad is in Coventry and nowhere near Piccadilly and Mr. Kane takes off his glasses and stares at her. What's this? Are we having a little contradiction here? Oh, no, Mr. Kane, God no. I want you to know, woman, that it is the policy here to give no relief to women with husbands in England. I want you to know you're taking the bread from the mouths of more deserving people who stayed in this country to do their bit. Oh, yes, Mr. Kane. And what's your name? McCourt, sir. That's not a Limerick name. Where did you get a name like that? My husband, sir. He's from the North. He's from the North and he leaves you here to get the relief from the Irish Free State. Is this what we fought for, is it? I don't know, sir. Why don't you go up to Belfast and see what the Orangemen will do for you, ah? I don't know, sir. You don't know. Of course you don't know. There's great ignorance in the world. He looks out at the people, I said there's great ignorance in the world, and the people nod their heads and agree there's great ignorance in the world. He whispers to Mr. Coffey and they look at Mam, they look at us. He tells Mam at last that she can have the public assistance but if she gets a single penny from her husband she's to drop all claims and give the money back to the Dispensary. She promises she will and we leave. We follow her to Kathleen O'Connell's shop to get tea and bread and a few sods of turf for the fire. We climb the stairs to Italy and get the fire going and it's cozy when we have our tea. We're all very quiet, even the baby Alphie, because we know what Mr. Kane did to our mother. X It's cold and wet down in Ireland but we're up in Italy. Mam says we should bring the poor Pope up to hang on the wall opposite the window. After all he's a friend of the workingman, he's Italian, and they're a warm weather people. Mam sits by the fire, shivering, and we know something is wrong when she makes no move for a cigarette. She says she feels a cold coming and she'd love to have a tarty drink, a lemonade. But there's no money in the house, not even for bread in the morning. She drinks tea and goes to bed. The bed creaks all night with her twistings and turnings and she keeps us awake with her moaning for water. In the morning, she stays in bed, still shivering, and we keep quiet. If she sleeps long enough Malachy and I will be too late for school. Hours pass and still she makes no move and when I know it's well past school time I start the fire for the kettle. She stirs and calls for lemonade but I give her a jam jar of water. I ask her if she'd like some tea and she acts like a woman gone deaf. She looks flushed and it's odd she doesn't even mention cigarettes. We sit quietly by the fire, Malachy, Michael, Alphie, myself. We drink our tea while Alphie chews the last bit of bread covered with sugar. He makes us laugh the way he smears the sugar all over his face and grins at us with his fat sticky cheeks. But we can't laugh too much or Mam will jump out of the bed and order Malachy and me off to school where we'll be killed for being late. We don't laugh long, there is no more bread and we're hungry, the four of us. We can get no more credit at O'Connell's shop. We can't go near Grandma, either. She yells at us all the time because Dad is from the North and he never sends money home from England where he is working in a munitions factory. Grandma says we could starve to death for all he cares. That would teach Mam a lesson for marrying a man from the North with sallow skin, an odd manner and a look of the Presbyterian about him. Still, I'll have to try Kathleen O'Connell once more. I'll tell her my mother is sick above in the bed, my brothers are starving and we'll all be dead for the want of bread. I put on my shoes and run quickly through the streets of Limerick to keep myself warm against the February frost. You can look in people's windows and see how cozy it is in their kitchens with fires glowing or ranges black and hot everything bright in the electric light cups and saucers on the tables with plates of sliced bread pounds of butter jars of jam smells of fried eggs and rashers coming through the windows enough to make the water run in your mouth and families sitting there digging in all smiling the mother crisp and clean in her apron everyone washed and the Sacred Heart of Jesus looking down on them from the wall suffering and sad but still happy with all that food and light and good Catholics at their breakfast. I try to find music in my own head but all I can find is my mother moaning for lemonade. Lemonade. There's a van pulling away from South's pub leaving crates of beer and lemonade outside and there isn't a soul on the street. In a second I have two bottles of lemonade up under my jersey and I saunter away trying to look innocent. There's a bread van outside Kathleen O'Connell's shop. The back door is open on shelves of steaming newly baked bread. The van driver is inside the shop having tea and a bun with Kathleen and it's no trouble for me to help myself to a loaf of bread. It's wrong to steal from Kathleen with the way she's always good to us but if I go in and ask her for bread she'll be annoyed and tell me I'm ruining her morning cup of tea, which she'd like to have in peace ease and comfort thank you. It's easier to stick the bread up under my jersey with the lemonade and promise to tell everything in confession. My brothers are back in bed playing games under the overcoats but they jump when they see the bread. We tear at the loaf because we're too hungry to slice it and we make tea from this morning's leaves. When my mother stirs Malachy holds the lemonade bottle to her lips and she gasps till she finishes it. If she likes it that much I'll have to find more lemonade. We put the last of the coal on the fire and sit around telling stories which we make up the way Dad did. I tell my brothers about my adventures with the lemonade and bread and I make up stories about how I was chased by pub owners and shopkeepers and how I ran into St. Joseph's Church where no one can follow you if you're a criminal, not even if you killed your own mother. Malachy and Michael look shocked over the way I got the bread and lemonade but then Malachy says it was only what Robin Hood would have done, rob the rich and give to the poor. Michael says I'm an outlaw and if they catch me they'll hang me from the highest tree in the People's Park the way outlaws are hanged in films at the Lyric Cinema. Malachy says I should make sure I'm in a state of grace because it might be hard to find a priest to come to my hanging. I tell him a priest would have to come to the hanging. That's what priests are for. Roddy McCorley had a priest and so did Kevin Barry. Malachy says there were no priests at the hanging of Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry because they're not mentioned in the songs and he starts singing the songs to prove it till my mother groans in the bed and says shut up. Alphie the baby is asleep on the floor by the fire. We put him into the bed with Mam so that he'll be warm though we don't want him to catch her disease and die. If she wakes up and finds him dead in the bed beside her there will be no end to the lamentations and she'll blame me on top of it. The three of us get back into our own bed, huddling under the overcoats and trying not to roll into the hole in the mattress. It's pleasant there till Michael starts to worry over Alphie getting Mam's disease and me getting hanged for an outlaw. He says it isn't fair because that would leave him with only one brother and everyone in the world has brothers galore. He falls asleep from the worry and soon Malachy drifts off and I lie there thinking of jam. Wouldn't it be lovely to have another loaf of bread and a jar of strawberry jam or any kind of jam. I can't remember ever seeing a jam van making a delivery and I wouldn't want to be like Jesse James blasting my way into a shop demanding jam. That would surely lead to a hanging. There's a cold sun coming through the window and I'm sure it must be warmer outside and wouldn't my brothers be surprised if they woke and found me there with more bread and jam. They'd gobble everything and then go on about my sins and the hanging. Mam is still asleep though her face is red and there's a strangling sound when she snores. I have to be careful going through the street because it's a school day and if Guard Dennehy sees me he'll drag me off to school and Mr. O'Halloran will knock me all over the classroom. The guard is in charge of school attendance and he loves chasing you on his bicycle and dragging you off to school by the ear. There's a box sitting outside the door of one of the big houses on Barrington Street. I pretend to knock on the door so that I can see what's in the box, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, cheese, tomatoes and, oh, God, a jar of marmalade. I can't shove all that under my jersey. Oh, God. Should I take the whole box? The people passing by pay me no attention. I might as well take the whole box. My mother would say you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I lift the box and try to look like a messenger boy making a delivery and no one says a word. Malachy and Michael are beside themselves when they see what's in the box and they're soon gobbling thick cuts of bread slathered with golden marmalade. Alphie has the marmalade all over his face and hair and a good bit on his legs and belly. We wash down the food with cold tea because we have no fire to heat it. Mam mumbles again for lemonade and I give her half the second bottle to keep her quiet. She calls for more and I mix it with water to stretch it because I can't be spending my life running around lifting lemonade from pubs. We're having a fine time of it till Mam begins to rave in the bed about her lovely little daughter taken from her and her twin boys gone before they were three and why couldn't God take the rich for a change and is there any lemonade in the house? Michael wants to know if Mam will die and Malachy tells him you can't die till a priest comes. Then Michael wonders if we'll ever have a fire and hot tea again because he's freezing in the bed even with the overcoats left over from olden times. Malachy says we should go from house to house asking for turf and coal and wood and we could use Alphie's pram to carry the load. We should take Alphie with us because he's small and he smiles and people will see him and feel sorry for him and us. We try to wash all the dirt and lint and feathers and sticky marmalade but when we touch him with water he howls. Michael says he'll only get dirty again in the pram so what's the use of washing him. Michael is small but he's always saying remarkable things like that. We push the pram out to the rich avenues and roads but when we knock on the doors the maids tell us go away or they'll call the proper authorities and it's a disgrace to be dragging a baby around in a wreck of a pram that smells to the heavens a filthy contraption that you wouldn't use to haul a pig to the slaughterhouse and this is a Catholic country where babies should be cherished and kept alive to hand down the faith from generation to generation. Malachy tells one maid to kiss his arse and she gives him such a clout the tears leap to his eyes and he says he'll never in his life ask the rich for anything again. He says there's no use asking anymore, that we should go around the backs of the houses and climb over the walls and take what we want. Michael can ring the front doorbells to keep the maids busy and Malachy and I can throw coal and turf over the walls and fill the pram all around Alphie. We collect that way from three houses but then Malachy throws a piece of coal over a wall and hits Alphie and he starts screaming and we have to run forgetting Michael, still ringing doorbells and getting abuse from maids. Malachy says we should take the pram home first and then go back for Michael. We can't stop now with Alphie bawling and people giving us dirty looks and telling us we're a disgrace to our mother and Ireland in general. When we're back home it takes a while to dig Alphie out from under the load of coal and turf and he won't stop screaming till I give him bread and marmalade. I'm afraid Mam will leap from her bed but she only mumbles on about Dad and drink and babies dead. Malachy is back with Michael, with stories of his adventures ringing doorbells. One rich woman answered the door herself and invited him into the kitchen for cake and milk and bread and jam. She asked him all about his family and he told her his father had a big job in England but his mother is in the bed with a desperate disease and calling for lemonade morning noon and night. The rich woman wanted to know who was taking care of us and Michael bragged we were taking care of ourselves, that there was no shortage of bread and marmalade. The rich woman wrote down Michael's name and address and told him be a good boy and go home to his brothers and his mother in the bed. Malachy barks at Michael for being such a fool as to tell a rich woman anything. She'll go now and tell on us and before we know it we'll have the priests of the world banging on the door and disturbing us. There's the banging on the door already. But it isn't a priest, it's Guard Dennehy. He calls up, Hello, hello, is anybody home? Are you there, Mrs. McCourt? Michael knocks on the window and waves at the guard. I give him a good kick for himself and Malachy thumps him on the head and he yells, I'll tell the guard. I'll tell the guard. They're killing me, guard. They're thumping and kicking. He won't shut up and Guard Dennehy shouts at us to open the door. I call out the window and tell him I can't open the door because my mother is in bed with a terrible disease. Where's your father? He's in England. Well, I'm coming in to talk to your mother. You can't. You can't. She has the disease. We all have the disease. It might be the typhoid. It might be the galloping consumption. We're getting spots already. The baby has a lump. It could kill. He pushes in the door and climbs the stairs to Italy just as Alphie crawls out from under the bed covered with marmalade and dirt. He looks at him and my mother and us, takes off his cap and scratches his head. He says, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, this is a desperate situation. How did your mother get sick like that? I tell him he shouldn't go near her and when Malachy says we might not be able to go to school for ages the guard says we'll go to school no matter what, that we're on the earth to go to school the way he's on the earth to make sure we go to school. He wants to know if we have any relations and he sends me off to tell Grandma and Aunt Aggie to come to our house. They scream at me and tell me I'm filthy. I try to explain that Mam has the disease and I'm worn out trying to make ends meet, keeping the home fires burning, getting lemonade for Mam and bread for my brothers. There's no use telling them about the marmalade for they'll only scream again. There's no use telling them about the nastiness of rich people and their maids. They push me all the way back to the lane, barking at me and disgracing me on the streets of Limerick. Guard Dennehy is still scratching his poll. He says, Look at this, a disgrace. You wouldn't see the likes of this in Bombay or the Bowery of New York itself. Grandma is wailing at my mother, Mother o' God, Angela, what's up with you in the bed? What did they do to you? My mother runs her tongue over her dry lips and gasps for more lemonade. She wants lemonade, says Michael, and we got it for her and bread and marmalade and we're all outlaws now. Frankie was the first outlaw till we went raiding for coal all over Limerick. Guard Dennehy looks interested and takes Michael downstairs by the hand and in a few minutes we hear him laughing. Aunt Aggie says that's a disgraceful way to behave with my mother sick in the bed. The guard comes back and tells her go for a doctor. He keeps covering his face with his cap whenever he looks at me or my brothers. Desperadoes, he says, desperadoes. The doctor comes with Aunt Aggie in his motor car and he has to rush my mother to the hospital with her pneumonia. We'd all like to go riding in the doctor's car but Aunt Aggie says, No, ye are all coming to my house till yeer mother comes home from the hospital. I tell her not to bother. I'm eleven and I can easily look after my brothers. I'd be glad to stay at home from school and make sure everyone is fed and washed. But Grandma screams I will do no such a thing and Aunt Aggie gives me a thump for myself. Guard Dennehy says I'm too young yet to be an outlaw and a father but I have a promising future in both departments. Get your clothes, says Aunt Aggie, ye are coming to my house till yeer mother is out of the hospital. Jesus above, that baby is a disgrace. She finds a rag and ties it around Alphie's bottom for fear he might shit all over the pram. Then she looks at us and wants to know why we're standing there with our faces hanging out after she told us get our clothes. I'm afraid she'll hit me or yell at me when I tell her it's all right, we have our clothes, they're on us. She stares at me and shakes her head. Here, she says, put some sugar and water in the child's bottle. She tells me I have to push Alphie through the streets, she can't manage the pram with that bockety wheel that makes it rock back and forth and besides 'tis a disgraceful looking object she'd be ashamed to put a mangy dog in. She takes the three old coats from our bed and piles them on the pram till you can hardly see Alphie at all. Grandma comes with us and barks at me all the way from Roden Lane to Aunt Aggie's flat in Windmill Street. Can't you push that pram properly? Jesus, you're going to kill that child. Stop goin' from side to side or I'll give you a good clitther on the gob. She won't come into Aunt Aggie's flat. She can't stand the sight of us one more minute. She's fed up with the whole McCourt clan from the days when she had to send six fares to bring us all back from America, dishing out more money for funerals for dead children, giving us food every time our father drank the dole or the wages, helping Angela carry on while that blaguard from the North drinks his wages all over England. Oh, she's fed up, so she is, and off she goes across Henry Street with her black shawl pulled up around her white head, limping along in her black high laced boots. When you're eleven and your brothers are ten, five and one, you don't know what to do when you go to someone's house even if she's your mother's sister. You're told to leave the pram in the hall and bring the baby into the kitchen but if it's not your house you don't know what to do once you get into the kitchen for fear the aunt will yell at you or hit you on the skull. She takes off her coat and takes it to the bedroom and you stand with the baby in your arms waiting to be told. If you take one step forward or one step to the side she might come out and say where are you going and you don't know what to answer because you don't know yourself. If you say anything to your brothers she might say who do you think you're talking to in my kitchen? We have to stand and be quiet and that's hard when there's a tinkling sound from the bedroom and we know she's on the chamber pot peeing away. I don't want to look at Malachy. If I do I'll smile and he'll smile and Michael will smile and there's danger we'll start laughing and if we do we won't be able to stop for days at the picture in our heads of Aunt Aggie's big white bum perched on a flowery little chamber pot. I'm able to control myself. I won't laugh. Malachy and Michael won't laugh and it's easy to see we're all proud of ourselves for not laughing and getting into trouble with Aunt Aggie till Alphie in my arms smiles and says Goo goo and that sets us off. The three of us burst out laughing and Alphie grins with his dirty face and says Goo goo again till we're helpless and Aunt Aggie roars out of the room pulling her dress down and gives me a thump on the head that sends me against the wall baby and all. She hits Malachy too and she tries to hit Michael but he runs to the other side of her round table and she can't get at him. Come over here, she says, and I'll wipe that grin off your puss, but Michael keeps running around the table and she's too fat to catch him. I'll get you later, she says, I'll warm your arse, and you, Lord Muck, she says to me, put that child down on the floor over there by the range. She puts the old coats from the pram on the floor and Alphie lies there with his sugary water and says Goo goo and smiles. She tells us take off every scrap of our clothes, get out to the tap in the backyard and scrub every inch of our bodies. We are not to come back into this house till we're spotless. I want to tell her it's the middle of February, it's freezing outside, we could all die, but I know if I open my mouth I might die right here on the kitchen floor. We're out in the yard naked dousing ourselves with icy water from the tap. She opens the kitchen window and throws out a scrub brush and a big bar of brown soap like the one they used on Finn the Horse. She orders us to scrub each other's backs and don't stop till she tells us. Michael says his hands and feet are falling off with the cold but she doesn't care. She keeps telling us we're still dirty and if she has to come out to scrub us we'll rue the day. Another rue. I scrub myself harder. We all scrub till we're pink and our jaws chatter. It's not enough for Aunt Aggie. She comes out with a bucket and sloshes cold water all over us. Now, she says, get inside and dry yeerselves. We stand in the little shed next to her kitchen drying ourselves with one towel. We stand and shiver and wait because you can't go marching into her kitchen till she tells you. We hear her inside starting the fire, rattling the poker in the range, then yelling at us, Are ye goin' to stand in there all day? Come in here and put on yeer clothes. She gives us mugs of tea and cuts of fried bread and we sit at the table eating quietly because you're not supposed to say a word unless she tells you. Michael asks her for a second cut of fried bread and we expect her to knock him off the chair for his cheek but she just grumbles, 'Tis far from two cuts of fried bread ye were brought up, and gives each of us another cut. She tries to feed Alphie bread soaked in tea but he won't eat it till she sprinkles it with sugar and when he's finished he smiles and pees all over her lap and we're delighted. She runs out to the shed to dab at herself with a towel and we're able to grin at each other at the table and tell Alphie he's the champion baby in the world. Uncle Pa Keating comes in the door all black from his job at the gas works. Oh, bejay, he says, what's this? Michael says, My mother is in the hospital, Uncle Pa. Is that so? What's up with her? Pneumonia, says Malachy. Well, now, that's better than oldmonia. We don't know what he's laughing at and Aunt Aggie comes in from the shed and tells him how Mam is in the hospital and we're to stay with them till she gets out. He says, Grand, grand, and goes to the shed to wash himself though when he comes back you'd never know he touched himself with water at all he's that black. He sits at the table and Aunt Aggie gives him his supper, which is fried bread and ham and sliced tomatoes. She tells us get away from the table and stop gawking at him having his tea and tells him to stop giving us bits of ham and tomato. He says, Arrah, for Jaysus sake, Aggie, the children are hungry, and she says, 'Tis none of your business. They're not yours. She tells us go out and play and be home for bed by half-past eight. We know it's freezing outside and we'd like to stay in by that warm range but it's easier to be in the streets playing than inside with Aunt Aggie and her nagging. She calls me in later and sends me upstairs to borrow a rubber sheet from a woman who had a child that died. The woman says tell your aunt I'd like that rubber sheet back for the next child. Aunt Aggie says, Twelve years ago that child died and she still keeps the rubber sheet. Forty-five she is now and if there's another child we'll have to look for a star in the East. Malachy says, What's that? and she tells him mind his own business, he's too young. Aunt Aggie places the rubber sheet on her bed and puts Alphie on it between herself and Uncle Pa. She sleeps inside against the wall and Uncle Pa outside because he has to get up in the morning for work. We are to sleep on the floor against the opposite wall with one coat under us and two over. She says if she hears a word out of us during the night she'll warm our arses and we're to be up early in the morning because it's Ash Wednesday and it wouldn't do us any harm to go to Mass and pray for our poor mother and her pneumonia. The alarm clock shocks us out of our sleep. Aunt Aggie calls from her bed, The three of ye are to get up and go to Mass. Do ye hear me? Up. Wash yeer faces and go to the Jesuits. Her backyard is all frost and ice and our hands sting from the tap water. We throw a little on our faces and dry with the towel that's still damp from yesterday. Malachy whispers our wash was a lick and a promise, that's what Mam would say. The streets are frosty and icy, too, but the Jesuit church is warm. It must be grand to be a Jesuit, sleeping in a bed with sheets blankets pillows and getting up to a nice warm house and a warm church with nothing to do but say Mass hear confessions and yell at people for their sins have your meals served up to you and read your Latin office before you go to sleep. I'd like to be a Jesuit some day but there's no hope of that when you grow up in a lane. Jesuits are very particular. They don't like poor people. They like people with motor cars who stick out their little fingers when they pick up their teacups. The church is crowded with people at seven o'clock Mass getting the ashes on their foreheads. Malachy whispers that Michael shouldn't get the ashes because he won't be making his First Communion till May and it would be a sin. Michael starts to cry, I want the ashes, I want the ashes. An old woman behind us says, What are ye doin' to that lovely child? Malachy explains the lovely child never made his First Communion and he's not in a state of grace. Malachy is getting ready for Confirmation himself, always showing off his knowledge of the catechism, always going on about state of grace. He won't admit I knew all about the state of grace a year ago, so long ago I'm starting to forget it. The old woman says you don't have to be in a state of grace to get a few ashes on your forehead and tells Malachy stop tormenting his poor little brother. She pats Michael on the head and tells him he's a lovely child and go up there and get your ashes. He runs to the altar and when he comes back the woman gives him a penny to go with his ashes. Aunt Aggie is still in the bed with Alphie. She tells Malachy to fill Alphie's bottle with milk and bring it to him. She tells me to start the fire in the range, that there's paper and wood in a box and coal in the coal scuttle. If the fire won't start sprinkle it with a little paraffin oil. The fire is slow and smoky and I sprinkle it with the paraffin oil, it flares up, whoosh, and nearly takes my eyebrows off. There is smoke everywhere and Aunt Aggie rushes into the kitchen. She shoves me away from the range. Jesus above, can't you do anything right? You're supposed to open the damper, you eejit. I don't know anything about dampers. In our house we have a fireplace in Ireland downstairs and a fireplace in Italy upstairs and no sign of a damper. Then you go to your aunt's house and you're supposed to know all about dampers. There's no use telling her this is the first time you ever lit a fire in a range. She'll just give you another thump on the skull and send you flying. It's hard to know why grown people get so angry over little things like dampers. When I'm a man I won't go around thumping small children over dampers or anything else. Now she yells at me, Look at Lord Muck standing there. Would you ever think of opening the window and letting out the smoke? Of course you wouldn't. You have a puss on you like your father from the North. Do you think now you can boil the water for the tea without burning the house down? She cuts three slices from a loaf, smears them with margarine for us and goes back to bed. We have the tea and bread and it's one morning we're glad to go to school where it's warm and there are no yelling aunts. After school she tells me sit at the table and write my father a letter about Mam in the hospital and how we're all at Aunt Aggie's till Mam comes home. I'm to tell him we're all happy and in the best of health, send money, food is very dear, growing boys eat a lot, ha ha, Alphie the baby needs clothes and nappies. I don't know why she's always angry. Her flat is warm and dry. She has electric light in the house and her own lavatory in the backyard. Uncle Pa has a steady job and he brings home his wages every Friday. He drinks his pints at South's pub but never comes home singing songs of Ireland's long woeful history. He says, A pox on all their houses, and he says the funniest thing in the world is that we all have arses that have to be wiped and no man escapes that. The minute a politician or a Pope starts his blather Uncle Pa thinks of him wiping his arse. Hitler and Roosevelt and Churchill all wipe their arses. De Valera, too. He says the only people you can trust in that department are the Mahommedans for they eat with one hand and wipe with the other. The human hand itself is a sneaky bugger and you never know what it's been up to. There are good times with Uncle Pa when Aunt Aggie goes to the Mechanics' Institute to play cards, forty-five. He says, To hell with the begrudgers. He gets himself two bottles of stout from South's, six buns and a half pound of ham from the shop on the corner. He makes tea and we sit by the range drinking it, eating our ham sandwiches and buns and laughing over Uncle Pa and the way he goes on about the world. He says, I swallowed the gas, I drink the pint, I don't give a fiddler's fart about the world and its cousin. If little Alphie gets tired and cranky and cries Uncle Pa pulls his shirt back from his chest and tells him, Here, have a suck of diddy momma. The sight of that flat chest and the nipple shocks Alphie and makes him good again. Before Aunt Aggie comes home we have to wash the mugs and clean up so she won't know we were stuffing ourselves with buns and ham sandwiches. She'd nag Uncle Pa for a month if she ever found out and that's what I don't understand. Why does he let her nag him like that? He went to the Great War, he was gassed, he's big, he has a job, he makes the world laugh. It's a mystery. That's what the priests and the masters tell you, everything is a mystery and you have to believe what you're told. I could easily have Uncle Pa for a father. We'd have great times sitting by the fire in the range drinking tea and laughing over the way he farts and says, Light a match. That's a present from the Germans. Aunt Aggie torments me all the time. She calls me scabby eyes. She says I'm the spitting image of my father, I have the odd manner, I have the sneaky air of a northern Presbyterian, I'll probably grow up and build an altar to Oliver Cromwell himself, I'll run off and marry an English tart and cover my house with pictures of the royal family. I want to get away from her and I can think of only one way, to make myself sick and go to the hospital. I get up in the middle of the night and go to her backyard. I can pretend I'm going to the lavatory. I stand out in the open in the freezing weather and hope I'll catch pneumonia or the galloping consumption so that I'll go to the hospital with the nice clean sheets and the meals in the bed and books brought by the girl in the blue dress. I might meet another Patricia Madigan and learn a long poem. I stand in the backyard for ages in my shirt and bare feet looking up at the moon which is a ghostly galleon riding upon cloudy seas and go back to bed shivering hoping I'll wake up in the morning with a terrible cough and flushed cheeks. But I don't. I feel fresh and lively and I'd be in great form if I could be at home with my mother and brothers. There are days when Aunt Aggie tells us she can't stand the sight of us another minute, Get away from me. Here, scabby eyes, take Alphie out in his pram, take your brothers, go to the park and play, do anything ye like and don't come back till teatime when the Angelus is ringing, not a minute later, do ye hear me, not a minute later. It's cold but we don't care. We push the pram up O'Connell Avenue out to Ballinacurra or the Rosbrien Road. We let Alphie crawl around in fields to look at cows and sheep and we laugh when the cows nuzzle him. I get under the cows and squirt the milk into Alphie's mouth till he's full and throws it up. Farmers chase us till they see how small Michael and Alphie are. Malachy laughs at the farmers. He says, Hit me now with the child in me arms. Then he has a great notion, Why can't we go to our own house and play a while? We find twigs and bits of wood in the fields and rush to Roden Lane. There are matches by the fireplace in Italy and we have a good fire going in no time. Alphie falls asleep and soon the rest of us drift off till the Angelus booms out of the Redemptorist church and we know we're in trouble with Aunt Aggie for being late. We don't care. She can yell at us all she wants but we had a grand time out the country with the cows and the sheep and then the lovely fire above in Italy. You can tell she never has grand times like that. Electric light and a lavatory but no grand times. Grandma comes for her on Thursdays and Sundays and they take the bus to the hospital to see Mam. We can't go because children are not allowed and if we say, How's Mam? they look cranky and tell us she's all right, she'll live. We'd like to know when she's getting out of hospital so that we can all go back home but we're afraid to open our mouths. Malachy tells Aunt Aggie one day he's hungry and could he have a piece of bread. She hits him with a rolled up Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart and there are tears on his eyelashes. He doesn't come home from school the next day and he's still gone at bedtime. Aunt Aggie says, Well, I suppose he ran away. Good riddance. If he was hungry he'd be here. Let him find comfort in a ditch. Next day Michael runs in from the street, Dad's here, Dad's here, and runs back out and there's Dad sitting on the hall floor hugging Michael, crying, Your poor mother, your poor mother, and there's a smell of drink on him. Aunt Aggie is smiling, Oh, you're here, and she makes tea and eggs and sausages. She sends me out for a bottle of stout for Dad and I wonder why she's so pleasant and generous all of a sudden. Michael says, Are we going to our own house, Dad? We are, son. Alphie is back in the pram with the three old coats and coal and wood for the fire. Aunt Aggie stands at her door and tells us be good boys, come back for tea anytime, and there's a bad word for her in my head, Oul' bitch. It's in my head and I can't help it and I'll have to tell the priest in confession. Malachy isn't in a ditch, he's there in our own house eating fish and chips a drunken soldier dropped at the gate of the Sarsfield Barracks. Mam comes home in two days. She's weak and white and walks slowly. She says, The doctor told me keep warm, have plenty of rest and nourishing food, meat and eggs three times a week. God help us, those poor doctors don't have a notion of not having. Dad makes tea and toasts bread for her on the fire. He fries bread for the rest of us and we have a lovely night up in Italy where it's warm. He says he can't stay forever, he has to go back to work in Coventry. Mam wonders how he'll get to Coventry without a penny in his pocket. He's up early on Holy Saturday and I have tea with him by the fire. He fries four cuts of bread and wraps them in pages of the Limerick Chronicle, two cuts in each coat pocket. Mam is still in bed and he calls to her from the bottom of the stairs, I'm going now. She says, All right. Write when you land. My father is going to England and she won't even get out of the bed. I ask if I can go with him to the railway station. No, he's not going there. He's going to the Dublin road to see if he can get a lift. He pats my head, tells me take care of my mother and brothers and goes out the door. I watch him go up the lane till he turns the corner. I run up the lane to see him go down Barrack Hill and down St. Joseph's Street. I run down the hill and follow him as far as I can. He must know I'm following him because he turns and calls to me, Go home, Francis. Go home to your mother. In a week there's a letter to say he arrived safely, that we are to be good boys, attend to our religious duties and above all obey our mother. In another week there's a telegram money order for three pounds and we're in heaven. We'll be rich, there will be fish and chips, jelly and custard, films every Saturday at the Lyric, the Coliseum, the Carlton, the Atheneum, the Central and the fanciest of all, the Savoy. We might even wind up having tea and cakes at the Savoy Café with the nobs and toffs of Limerick. We'll be sure to hold our teacups with our little fingers sticking out. The next Saturday there's no telegram nor the Saturday after nor any Saturday forever. Mam begs again at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and smiles at the Dispensary when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane have their bit of a joke about Dad having a tart in Piccadilly. Michael wants to know what a tart is and she tells him it's something you have with tea. She spends most of the day by the fire with Bridey Hannon puffing on her Woodlbines, drinking weak tea. The bread crumbs from the morning are always on the table when we come home from school. She never washes the jam jars or mugs and there are flies in the sugar and wherever there is sweetness. She says Malachy and I have to take turns looking after Alphie, taking him out in the pram for a bit of fresh air. The child can't be kept in Italy from October to April. If we tell her we want to play with our pals she might let fly with a right cross to the head that stings the ears. We play games with Alphie and the pram. I stand at the top of Barrack Hill and Malachy is at the bottom. When I give the pram a push down the hill Malachy is supposed to stop it but he's looking at a pal on roller skates and it speeds by him across the street and through the doors of Leniston's pub where men are having a peaceful pint and not expecting a pram with a dirty faced child saying Goo goo goo goo. The barman shouts this is a disgrace, there must be a law against this class of behavior, babies roaring through the door in bockety prams, he'll call the guards on us, and Alphie waves at him and smiles and he says, all right, all right, the child can have a sweet and a lemonade, the brothers can have lemonade too, that raggedy pair, and God above, 'tis a hard world, the minute you think you're getting ahead a pram comes crashing through the door and you're dishing out sweets and lemonade right and left, the two of ye take that child and go home to yeer mother. Malachy has another powerful idea, that we could go around Limerick like tinkers pushing Alphie in his pram into pubs for the sweets and lemonade, but I don't want Mam finding out and hitting me with her right cross. Malachy says I'm not a sport and runs off. I push the pram over to Henry Street and up by the Redemptorist church. It's a gray day, the church is gray and the small crowd of people outside the door of the priests' house is gray. They're waiting to beg for any food left over from the priests' dinner. There in the middle of the crowd in her dirty gray coat is my mother. This is my own mother, begging. This is worse than the dole, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Dispensary. It's the worst kind of shame, almost as bad as begging on the streets where the tinkers hold up their scabby children, Give us a penny for the poor child, mister, the poor child is hungry, missus. My mother is a beggar now and if anyone from the lane or my school sees her the family will be disgraced entirely. My pals will make up new names and torment me in the schoolyard and I know what they'll say, Frankie McCourt beggar woman's boy scabby-eyed dancing blubber-gob Jap. The door of the priests' house swings open and the people rush with their hands out. I can hear them, Brother, brother, here, brother, ah, for the love o' God, brother. Five children at home, brother. I can see my own mother pushed along. I can see the tightness of her mouth when she snatches at a bag and turns from the door and I push the pram up the street before she can see me. I don't want to go home anymore. I push the pram down to the Dock Road, out to Corkanree where all the dust and garbage of Limerick is dumped and burned. I stand a while and look at boys chase rats. I don't know why they have to torture rats that are not in their houses. I'd keep going on into the country forever if I didn't have Alphie bawling with the hunger, kicking his chubby legs, waving his empty bottle. Mam has the fire going and something boiling in a pot. Malachy smiles and says she brought home corned beef and a few spuds from Kathleen O'Connell's shop. He wouldn't be so happy if he knew he was the son of a beggar. She calls us in from the lane and when we sit at the table it's hard for me to look at my mother the beggar. She lifts the pot to the table, spoons out the potatoes one each and uses a fork to lift out the corned beef. It isn't corned beef at all. It's a great lump of quivering gray fat and the only sign of corned beef is a little nipple of red meat on top. We stare at that bit of meat and wonder who will get it. Mam says, That's for Alphie. He's a baby, he's growing fast, he needs it. She puts it on a saucer in front of him. He pushes it away with his finger, then pulls it back. He lifts it to his mouth, looks around the kitchen, sees Lucky the dog and throws it to him. There's no use saying anything. The meat is gone. We eat our potatoes with plenty of salt and I eat my fat and pretend it's that nipple of red meat. XI Mam warns us, Ye are to keep yeer paws out of that trunk for there's nothing in there that's of the slightest interest or any of yeer business. All she has in that trunk is a lot of papers, certificates of birth and baptism, her Irish passport, Dad's English passport from Belfast, our American passports and her bright red flapper dress with spangles and black frills she brought all the way from America. She wants to keep that dress forever to remind herself she was young and dancing. I don't care what she has in the trunk till I start a football team with Billy Campbell and Malachy. We can't afford uniforms or boots and Billy says, How will the world know who we are? We don't even have a name. I remember the red dress and a name comes to me, The Red Hearts of Limerick. Mam never opens the trunk so what does it matter if I cut off a piece of the dress to make seven red hearts we can stick on our chests? What you don't know won't bother you, she always says herself. The dress is buried under the papers. I look at my passport picture when I was small and I can see why they call me Jap. There's a paper that says Marriage Certificate, that Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan were joined in Holy Matrimony on the twenty-eighth of March, 1930. How could that be? I was born on the nineteenth of August and Billy Campbell told me the father and mother have to be married nine months before there's a sign of a child. Here I am born into the world in half the time. That means I must be a miracle and I might grow up to be a saint with people celebrating the feast of St. Francis of Limerick. I'll have to ask Mikey Molloy, still the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General. Billy says if we're to be great soccer players we have to practice and we're to meet over in the park. The boys complain when I hand out the hearts and I tell them if they don't like it they can go home and cut up their own mother's dresses and blouses. We have no money for a proper ball so one of the boys brings a sheep's bladder stuffed with rags. We kick the bladder up and down the meadow till there are holes and rags start falling out and we get fed up kicking a bladder that's hardly there anymore. Billy says we're to meet tomorrow morning which is Saturday and go out Ballinacurra to see if we can challenge rich Crescent College boys to a proper game, seven a side. He says we're to pin our red hearts to our shirts even if they're red rags. Malachy is going home for tea but I can't go because I have to see Mikey Molloy and find out why I was born in half the time. Mikey is coming out of his house with his father, Peter. It's Mikey's sixteenth birthday and his father is taking him to Bowles's pub for his first pint. Nora Molloy is inside screeching after Peter that if they go they can stay gone, she's done baking bread, she's never going to the lunatic asylum again, if he brings that child home drunk she'll go to Scotland and disappear from the face of the earth. Peter tells Mikey, Pay no attention to her, Cyclops. The mothers of Ireland are always enemies of the first pint. My own mother tried to kill my father with a frying pan when he took me for the first pint. Mikey asks Peter if I can come with them and have a lemonade. Peter tells everyone in the pub that Mikey is there for his first pint and when all the men want to stand Mikey a pint Peter says, Ah, no, 'twould be a terrible thing if he had too much and turned against it entirely. The pints are drawn and we sit against the wall, the Molloys with their pints and I with my lemonade. The men wish Mikey all the best in the life to come and wasn't it a gift from God that he fell off that spout years ago and never had the fit since and wasn't it a great pity about that poor little bugger, Quasimodo Dooley, carried off with the consumption after all his trouble talking for years like an Englishman so he could be on the BBC which is no fit place for an Irishman anyway. Peter is talking to the men and Mikey, sipping his first pint, whispers to me, I don't think I like it, but don't tell my father. Then he tells me how he practices the English accent in secret so that he can be a BBC announcer, Quasimodo's dream. He tells me I can have Cuchulain back, that he's no use to you when you're reading the news on the BBC. Now that he's sixteen he wants to go to England and if ever I get a wireless that will be him on the BBC Home Service. I tell him about the marriage certificate, how Billy Campbell said it has to be nine months but I was born in half the time and would he know if I was some class of a miracle. Naw, he says, naw. You're a bastard. You're doomed. You don't have to be cursing me, Mikey. I'm not. That's what they call people who aren't born inside the nine months of the marriage, people conceived beyond the blanket. What's that? What's what? Conceived. That's when the sperm hits the egg and it grows and there you are nine months later. I don't know what you're talking about. He whispers, The thing between your legs is the excitement. I don't like the other names, the dong, the prick, the dick, the langer. So your father shoves his excitement into your mother and there's a spurt and these little germs go up into your mother where there's an egg and that grows into you. I'm not an egg. You are an egg. Everyone was an egg once. Why am I doomed? 'Tisn't my fault I'm a bastard. All bastards are doomed. They're like babies that weren't baptized. They're sent to Limbo for eternity and there's no way out and it's not their fault. It makes you wonder about God up there on His throne with no mercy for the little unbaptized babies. That's why I don't go near the chapel anymore. Anyway, you're doomed. Your father and mother had the excitement and they weren't married so you're not in a state of grace. What am I going to do? Nothing. You're doomed. Can't I light a candle or something. You could try the Blessed Virgin. She's in charge of the doom. But I don't have a penny for the candle. All right, all right, here's a penny. You can give it back when you get a job a million years from now. 'Tis costing me a fortune to be the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General. The barman is doing a crossword puzzle and he says to Peter, What's the opposite of advance? Retreat, says Peter. That's it, says the barman. Everything has an opposite. Mother o' God, says Peter. What's up with you, Peter? says the barman. What was that you said before, Tommy? Everything has an opposite. Mother o' God. Are you all right, Peter? Is the pint all right? The pint is grand, Tommy, and I'm the champion of all pint drinkers, amn't I? Begod an' you are, Peter. No denyin' that to you. That means I could be the champion in the opposite department. What are you talking about, Peter? I could be the champion of no pints at all. Ah, now, Peter, I think you're going a bit far. Is the wife all right at home? Tommy, take this pint away from me. I'm the champion of no pints at all. Peter turns and takes the glass from Mikey. We're going home to your mother, Mikey. You didn't call me Cyclops, Dad. You're Mikey. You're Michael. We're going to England. No more pints for me, no pints for you, no more bread baking for your mother. Come on. We're leaving the pub and Tommy the barman calls after us, You know what 'tis, Peter. 'Tis all them bloody books you're reading. They have your head destroyed. Peter and Mikey turn to go home. I have to go to St. Joseph's to light the candle that will save me from the doom but I look in the window of Counihan's shop and there in the middle is a great slab of Cleeves' toffee and a sign, TWO PIECES FOR A PENNY. I know I'm doomed but the water is running along the sides of my tongue and when I put my penny on the counter for Miss Counihan I promise the Virgin Mary the next penny I get I'll be lighting a candle and would she please talk to her Son and delay the doom for awhile. A penn'orth of Cleeves' toffee doesn't last forever and when it's gone I have to think of going home to a mother who let my father push his excitement into her so that I could be born in half the time and grow up to be a bastard. If she ever says a word about the red dress or anything I'll tell her I know all about the excitement and she'll be shocked. Saturday morning I meet The Red Hearts of Limerick and we wander out the road looking for a football challenge. The boys are still grousing that the bits of red dress don't look like hearts till Billy tells them if they don't want to play football go home and play with their sisters' dolls. There are boys playing football in a field in Ballinacurra and Billy challenges them. They have eight players and we have only seven but we don't mind because one of them has one eye and Billy tells us stay on his blind side. Besides, he says, Frankie McCourt is nearly blind with his two bad eyes and that's worse. They're all togged out in blue and white jerseys and white shorts and proper football boots. One of them says we look like something the cat brought in and Malachy has to be held back from fighting them. We agree to play half an hour because the Ballinacurra boys say they have to go to lunch. Lunch. The whole world has dinner in the middle of the day but they have lunch. If no one scores in half an hour it's a draw. We play back and forth till Billy gets the ball and goes speeding and dancing up the sideline so fast no one can catch him and in goes the ball for a goal. The half hour is nearly up but the Ballinacurra boys want another half hour and they manage to score well into the second half hour. Then the ball goes over the line for touch. It's our ball. Billy stands on the touch line with the ball over his head. He pretends to look at Malachy but throws the ball to me. It comes to me as if it's the only thing that exists in the whole world. It comes straight to my foot and all I have to do is swivel to the left and swing that ball straight into the goal. There's a whiteness in my head and I feel like a boy in heaven. I'm floating over the whole field till The Red Hearts of Limerick clap me on the back and tell me that was a great goal, Frankie, you too, Billy. We walk back along O'Connell Avenue and I keep thinking of the way the ball came to my foot and surely it was sent by God or the Blessed Virgin Mary who would never send such a blessing to one doomed for being born in half the time and I know as long as I live I'll never forget that ball coming from Billy Campbell, that goal. Mam meets Bridey Hannon and her mother going up the lane and they tell her about Mr. Hannon's poor legs. Poor John, it's a trial for him to cycle home every night after delivering coal and turf all day on the great float for the coal merchants on the Dock Road. He's paid from eight in the morning till half five in the evening though he has to get the horse ready well before eight and settle him for the night well after half five. He's up and down on that float all day hoisting bags of coal and turf, desperate to keep the bandages in place on his legs so the dirt won't get into the open sores. The bandages are forever sticking and have to be ripped away and when he comes home she washes the sores with warm water and soap, covers them with ointment and wraps them in clean bandages. They can't afford new bandages every day so she keeps washing the old ones over and over till they're gray. Mam says Mr. Hannon should see the doctor and Mrs. Hannon says, Sure, he seen the doctor a dozen times and the doctor says he has to stay off them legs. That's all. Stay off them legs. Sure how can he stay off them legs? He has to work. What would we live on if he didn't work? Mam says maybe Bridey could get some kind of a job herself and Bridey is offended. Don't you know I have a weak chest, Angela? Don't you know I had rheumatic fever an' I could go at any time? I have to be careful. Mam often talks about Bridey and her rheumatic fever and weak chest. She says, That one is able to sit here by the hour and complain about her ailments but it doesn't stop her from puffing away on the Woodbines. Mam tells Bridey she's very sorry over the weak chest and it's terrible the way her father suffers. Mrs. Hannon tells my mother that John is getting worse every day, And what would you think, Mrs. McCourt, if your boy Frankie went on the float with him a few hours a week and helped him with the bags? We can barely afford it but Frankie could earn a shilling or two and John could rest his poor legs. Mam says, I don't know, he's only eleven and he had that typhoid and the coal dust wouldn't be good for his eyes. Bridey says, He'd be out in the air and there's nothing like fresh air for someone with bad eyes or getting over the typhoid, isn't that right, Frankie? 'Tis, Bridey. I'm dying to go around with Mr. Hannon on the great float like a real workingman. If I'm good at it they might let me stay at home from school forever but Mam says, He can do it as long as it doesn't interfere with school and he can start on a Saturday morning. I'm a man now so I light the fire early on Saturday morning and make my own tea and fried bread. I wait next door for Mr. Hannon to come out with his bicycle and there's a lovely smell of rashers and eggs coming through the window. Mam says Mr. Hannon gets the best of food because Mrs. Hannon is as mad about him as she was the day she married him. They're like two lovers out of an American film the way they go on. Here he is pushing the bicycle and puffing away on the pipe in his mouth. He tells me climb up on the bar of his bike and off we go to my first job as a man. His head is over mine on the bike and the smell of the pipe is lovely. There's a coal smell on his clothes and that makes me sneeze. Men are walking or cycling toward the coal yards and Rank's Flour Mills and the Limerick Steamship Company on the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon takes his pipe from his mouth and tells me this is the best morning of all, Saturday, half day. We'll start at eight and be finished by the time the Angelus rings at twelve. First we get the horse ready, give him a bit of a rub, fill the wooden tub with oats and the bucket with water. Mr. Hannon shows me how to put on the harness and lets me back the horse into the shafts of the float. He says, Jaysus, Frankie, you have the knack of it. That makes me so happy I want to jump up and down and drive a float the rest of my life. There are two men filling bags with coal and turf and weighing them on the great iron scale, a hundredweight in each bag. It's their job to stack the bags on the float while Mr. Hannon goes to the office for the delivery dockets. The bag men are fast and we're ready for our rounds. Mr. Hannon sits up on the left side of the float and flicks the whip to show where I'm to sit on the right side. It's hard to climb up the way the float is so high and packed with bags and I try to get up by climbing the wheel. Mr. Hannon says I should never do the likes of that again. Never put your leg or hand near a wheel when the horse is harnessed in the shafts. A horse might take a notion to go for a walk for himself and there you are with the leg or the arm caught in the wheel and twisted off your body and you looking at it. He says to the horse, G'up ower that, and the horse shakes his head and rattles the harness and Mr. Hannon laughs. That fool of a horse loves to work, he says. He won't be rattling his harness in a few hours. When the rain starts we cover ourselves with old coal bags and Mr. Hannon turns his pipe upside down in his mouth to keep the tobacco dry. He says the rain makes everything heavier but what's the use of complaining. You might as well complain about the sun in Africa. We cross the Sarsfield Bridge for deliveries to the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road. Rich people, says Mr. Hannon, and very slow to put their hands in their pockets for a tip. We have sixteen bags to deliver. Mr. Hannon says we're lucky today because some houses get more than one and he doesn't have to be climbing on and off that float destroying his legs. When we stop he gets down and I pull the bag to the edge and lay it on his shoulders. Some houses have areas outside where you pull up a trap door and tip the bag till it empties and that's easy. There are other houses with long backyards and you can see Mr. Hannon suffering with his legs when he has to carry the bags from the float to the sheds near the back doors. Ah, Jaysus, Frankie, ah, Jaysus, is the only complaint out of him and he asks me to give him a hand to climb back on the float. He says if he had a handcart he could wheel the bags from float to house and that would be a blessing but a handcart would cost two weeks' wages and who could afford that? The bags are delivered and the sun is out, the float is empty, and the horse knows his workday is over. It's lovely to sit on the float looking along the length of the horse from his tail to his head rocking along the Ennis Road over the Shannon and up the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon says the man who delivered sixteen hundredweights of coal and turf deserves a pint and the boy who helped him deserves a lemonade. He tells me I should go to school and not be like him working away with the two legs rotting under him. Go to school, Frankie, and get out of Limerick and Ireland itself. This war will be over some day and you can go to America or Australia or any big open country where you can look up and see no end to the land. The world is wide and you can have great adventures. If I didn't have these two legs I'd be over in England making a fortune in the factories like the rest of the Irishmen, like your father. No, not like your father. I hear he left you high and dry, eh? I don't know how a man in his right mind can go off and leave a wife and family to starve and shiver in a Limerick winter. School, Frankie, school. The books, the books, the books. Get out of Limerick before your legs rot and your mind collapses entirely. The horse clops along and when we get to the coal yard we feed and water him and give him a rubdown. Mr. Hannon talks to him all the time and calls him Me oul' segosha, and the horse snuffles and pushes his nose against Mr. Hannon's chest. I'd love to bring this horse home and let him stay downstairs when we're up in Italy but even if I could get him in the door my mother would yell at me that the last thing we need in this house is a horse. The streets going up from the Dock Road are too hilly for Mr. Hannon to ride the bicycle and carry me, so we walk. His legs are sore from the day and it takes a long time to get up to Henry Street. He leans on the bicycle or sits on the steps outside houses, grinding down on the pipe in his mouth. I'm wondering when I'll get the money for the day's work because Mam might let me go to the Lyric Cinema if I get home in time with my shilling or whatever Mr. Hannon gives me. Now we're at the door of South's pub and he tells me come in, didn't he promise me a lemonade? Uncle Pa Keating is sitting in the pub. He's all black as usual and he's sitting next to Bill Galvin, all white as usual, snuffling and taking great slugs out of his black pint. Mr. Hannon says, How're you? and sits on the other side of Bill Galvin and everyone in the pub laughs. Jaysus, says the barman, look at that, two lumps of coal and a snowball. Men come in from other parts of the pub to see the two coal black men with the lime white man in the middle and they want to send down to the Limerick Leader for a man with a camera. Uncle Pa says, What are you doing all black yourself, Frankie? Did you fall down a coal mine? I was helping Mr. Hannon on the float. Your eyes look atrocious, Frankie. Piss holes in the snow. 'Tis the coal dust, Uncle Pa. Wash them when you go home. I will, Uncle Pa. Mr. Hannon buys me a lemonade, gives me the shilling for my morning's work and tells me I can go home now, I'm a great worker and I can help him again next week after school. On the way home I see myself in the glass of a shop window all black from the coal, and I feel like a man, a man with a shilling in his pocket, a man who had a lemonade in a pub with two coal men and a lime man. I'm not a child anymore and I could easily leave Leamy's School forever. I could work with Mr. Hannon every day and when his legs got too bad I could take over the float and deliver coal to the rich people the rest of my life and my mother wouldn't have to be a beggar at the Redemptorist priests' house. People on the streets and lanes give me curious looks. Boys and girls laugh and call out, Here's the chimney sweep. How much do you want for cleaning our chimney? Did you fall into a coal hole? Were you burned by the darkness? They're ignorant. They don't know I spent the day delivering hundredweights of coal and turf. They don't know I'm a man. Mam is sleeping up in Italy with Alphie and there's a coat over the window to keep the room dark. I tell her I earned a shilling and she says I can go to the Lyric, I deserve it. Take tuppence and leave the rest of the shilling on the mantelpiece downstairs so that she can send out for a loaf of bread for the tea. The coat suddenly drops from the window and the room is bright. Mam looks at me, God above, look at your eyes. Go downstairs and I'll be down in a minute to wash them. She heats water in the kettle and dabs at my eyes with boric acid powder and tells me I can't go to the Lyric Cinema today or any day till my eyes clear up though God knows when that will be. She says, You can't be delivering coal with the state of your eyes. The dust will surely destroy them. I want the job. I want to bring home the shilling. I want to be a man. You can be a man without bringing home a shilling. Go upstairs and lie down and rest your two eyes or it's a blind man you'll be. I want that job. I wash my eyes three times a day with the boric acid powder. I remember Seamus in the hospital and how his uncle's eyes were cured with the blink exercise and I make sure to sit and blink for an hour every day. You can't beat the blink for the strong eye, he said. And now I blink and blink till Malachy runs to my mother, talking out in the lane with Mrs. Hannon, Mam, something is up with Frankie, he's upstairs blinking and blinking. She comes running up. What's wrong with you? I'm making my eyes strong with the exercise. What exercise? The blinking. Blinking is not exercise. Seamus in the hospital says you can't beat the blink for the strong eye. His uncle had powerful eyes from the blinking. She says I'm getting odd and goes back to the lane and her chat with Mrs. Hannon and I blink and bathe my eyes with the boric acid powder in warm water. I can hear Mrs. Hannon through the window, Your little Frankie is a godsend to John for 'tis the climbing up and down on that float that was ruining his legs entirely. Mam doesn't say anything and that means she feels so sorry for Mr. Hannon she'll let me help him again on his heavy delivery day, Thursday. I wash my eyes three times a day and I blink till I get a pain in my eyebrows. I blink in school when the master isn't looking and all the boys in my class are calling me Blinky and adding that to the list of names. Blinky McCourt beggar woman's son scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing Jap. I don't care what they call me anymore as long as my eyes are clearing up and I have a regular job lifting hundredweights of coal on a float. I wish they could see me on Thursday after school when I'm on the float and Mr. Hannon hands me the reins so that he can smoke his pipe in comfort. Here you are, Frankie, nice and gentle for this is a good horse and he doesn't need to be pulled at. He hands me the whip too but you never need the whip with this horse. It's all for show and I just flick it at the air like Mr. Hannon or I might knock a fly off the horse's great golden rump swinging between the shafts. Surely the world is looking at me and admiring the way I rock with the float, the cool way I have with the reins and the whip. I wish I had a pipe like Mr. Hannon and a tweed cap. I wish I could be a real coal man with black skin like Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa Keating so that people would say, There goes Frankie McCourt that delivers all the coal in Limerick and drinks his pint in South's pub. I'd never wash my face. I'd be black every day of the year even Christmas when you're supposed to give yourself a good wash for the coming of the Infant Jesus. I know He wouldn't mind because I saw the Three Wise Men in the Christmas crib at the Redemptorist church and one of them was blacker than Uncle Pa Keating, the blackest man in Limerick, and if a Wise Man is black it means that everywhere you go in the world someone is delivering coal. The horse lifts his tail and great lumps of steaming yellow shit drop from his behind. I start to pull on the reins so that he can stop and have a bit of comfort for himself but Mr. Hannon says, No, Frankie, let him trot. They always shit on the trot. That's one of the blessings horses have, they shit on the trot, and they're not dirty and stinking like the human race, not at all, Frankie. The worst thing in the world is to go into a lavatory after a man that had a feed of pig's feet and a night of pints. The stink from that could twist the nostrils of a strong man. Horses are different. All they have is oats and hay and what they drop is clean and natural. I work with Mr. Hannon after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the half day on Saturday morning and that means three shillings for my mother though she worries all the time over my eyes. The minute I get home she washes them and makes me rest them for half an hour. Mr. Hannon says he'll wait near Leamy's School for me on Thursdays after his deliveries on Barrington Street. Now the boys will see me. Now they'll know I'm a workingman and more than a scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing Jap. Mr. Hannon says, Up you get, and I climb up on the float like any workingman. I look at the boys gawking at me. Gawking. I tell Mr. Hannon if he wants to smoke his pipe in comfort I'll take the reins and when he hands them over I'm sure I hear the boys gasping. I tell the horse, G'up ower that, like Mr. Hannon. We trot away and I know dozens of Leamy's boys are committing the deadly sin of envy. I tell the horse again, G'up ower that, to make sure everyone heard, to make sure they know I'm driving that float and no one else, to make sure they'll never forget it was me they saw on that float with the reins and the whip. It's the best day of my life, better than my First Communion day, which Grandma ruined, better than my Confirmation day when I had the typhoid. They don't call me names anymore. They don't laugh at my scabby eyes. They want to know how I got such a good job at eleven years of age and what I'm paid and if I'll have that job forever. They want to know if there are any other good jobs going in the coal yards and would I put in a good word for them. Then there are big boys of thirteen who stick their faces in mine and say they should have that job because they're bigger and I'm nothing but a scrawny little runt with no shoulders. They can talk as much as they like. I have the job and Mr. Hannon tells me I'm powerful. There are days his legs are so bad he can hardly walk at all and you can see Mrs. Hannon worries. She gives me a mug of tea and I watch her roll up his trouser legs and peel away the dirty bandages. The sores are red and yellow and clogged with coal dust. She washes them with soapy water and smears them with a yellow ointment. She props the legs up on a chair and that's where he stays the rest of the night reading the paper or a book from the shelf above his head. The legs are getting so bad he has to get up an hour earlier in the morning to get the stiffness out, to put on another dressing. It's still dark one Saturday morning when Mrs. Hannon knocks at our door and asks me if I'd go to a neighbor and borrow their handcart to take on the float for Mr. Hannon will never be able to carry the bags today and maybe I'd just roll them on the handcart for him. He won't be able to carry me on his bicycle so I can meet him at the yard with the handcart. The neighbor says, Anything for Mr. Hannon, God bless him. I wait at the gate of the coal yard and watch him cycle toward me, slower than ever. He's so stiff he can hardly get off the bike and he says, You're a great man, Frankie. He lets me get the horse ready though I still have trouble getting on the harness. He lets me handle the float out of the yard and into the frosty streets and I wish I could drive forever and never go home. Mr. Hannon shows me how to pull the bags to the edge of the float and drop them on the ground so that I can pull them on to the handcart and push them to the houses. He tells me how to lift and push the bags without straining myself and we have the sixteen bags delivered by noon. I wish the boys at Leamy's could see me now, the way I drive the horse and handle the bags, the way I do everything while Mr. Hannon rests his legs. I wish they could see me pushing the handcart to South's pub and having my lemonade with Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa and me all black and Bill Galvin all white. I'd like to show the world the tips Mr. Hannon lets me keep, four shillings, and the shilling he gives me for the morning's work, five shillings altogether. Mam is sitting by the fire and when I hand her the money she looks at me, drops it in her lap and cries. I'm puzzled because money is supposed to make you happy. Look at your eyes, she says. Go to that glass and look at your eyes. My face is black and the eyes are worse than ever. The whites and the eyelids are red, and the yellow stuff oozes to the corners and out over the lower lids. If the ooze sits a while it forms a crust that has to be picked off or washed away. Mam says that's the end of it. No more Mr. Hannon. I try to explain that Mr. Hannon needs me. He can barely walk anymore. I had to do everything this morning, drive the float, wheel the handcart with the bags, sit in the pub, drink lemonade, listen to the men discussing who is the best, Rommel or Montgomery. She says she's sorry for Mr. Hannon's troubles but we have troubles of our own and the last thing she needs now is a blind son stumbling through the streets of Limerick. Bad enough you nearly died of typhoid, now you want to go blind on top of it. And I can't stop crying now because this was my one chance to be a man and bring home the money the telegram boy never brought from my father. I can't stop crying because I don't know what Mr. Hannon is going to do on Monday morning when he has no one to help him pull the bags to the edge of the float, to push the bags into the houses. I can't stop crying because of the way he is with that horse he calls sweet because he's so gentle himself and what will the horse do if Mr. Hannon isn't there to take him out, if I'm not there to take him out? Will that horse fall down hungry for the want of oats and hay and the odd apple? Mam says I shouldn't be crying, it's bad for the eyes. She says, We'll see. That's all I can tell you now. We'll see. She washes my eyes and gives me sixpence to take Malachy to the Lyric to see Boris Karloff in The Man They Could Not Hang and have two pieces of Cleeves' toffee. It's hard to see the screen with the yellow stuff oozing from my eyes and Malachy has to tell me what's happening. People around us tell him shut up, they'd like to hear what Boris Karloff is saying, and when Malachy talks back to them and tells them he's only helping his blind brother they call the man in charge, Frank Goggin, and he says if he hears another word out of Malachy he'll throw the two of us out. I don't mind. I have a way of squeezing the stuff out of one eye and clearing it so that I can see the screen while the other eye fills up and I go back and forth, squeeze, look, squeeze, look, and everything I see is yellow. Monday morning Mrs. Hannon is knocking on our door again. She asks Mam if Frank would ever go down to the coal yard and tell the man in the office that Mr. Hannon can't come in today, that he has to see a doctor about his legs, that he'll surely be in tomorrow and what he can't deliver today he will tomorrow. Mrs. Hannon always calls me Frank now. Anyone that delivers hundredweights of coal is not a Frankie. The man in the office says, Humph. I think we're very tolerant with Hannon. You, what's your name? McCourt, sir. Tell Hannon we'll need a note from the doctor. Do you understand that? I do, sir. The doctor tells Mr. Hannon he has to go to the hospital or it's a case of gangrene he'll have and the doctor won't be responsible. The ambulance takes Mr. Hannon away and my big job is gone. Now I'll be white like everyone else in Leamy's, no float, no horse, no shillings to bring home to my mother. In a few days Bridey Hannon comes to our door. She says her mother would like me to come and see her, have a cup of tea with her. Mrs. Hannon is sitting by the fire with her hand on the seat of Mr. Hannon's chair. Sit down, Frank, she says, and when I go to sit on one of the ordinary kitchen chairs she says, No, sit here. Sit here on the chair of himself. Do you know how old he is, Frank? Oh, he must be very old, Mrs. Hannon. He must be thirty-five. She smiles. She has lovely teeth. He's forty-nine, Frank, and a man that age shouldn't have legs like that. He shouldn't, Mrs. Hannon. Did you know you were a joy to him going around on that float? I didn't, Mrs. Hannon. You were. We had two daughters, Bridey that you know, and Kathleen, the nurse above in Dublin. But no son and he said you gave him the feeling of a son. I feel my eyes burning and I don't want her to see me crying especially when I don't know why I'm crying. That's all I do lately. Is it the job? Is it Mr. Hannon? My mother says, Oh, your bladder is near your eye. I think I'm crying because of the quiet way Mrs. Hannon is talking and she's talking like that because of Mr. Hannon. Like a son, she says, and I'm glad he had that feeling. His working days are over, you know. He has to stay at home from this out. There might be a cure and if there is sure he might be able to get a job as a watchman where he doesn't have to be lifting and hauling. I won't have a job anymore, Mrs. Hannon. You have a job, Frank. School. That's your job. That's not a job, Mrs. Hannon. You'll never have another job like it, Frank. It breaks Mr. Hannon's heart to think of you dragging bags of coal off a float and it breaks your mother's heart and 'twill destroy your eyes. God knows I'm sorry I ever got you into this for it had your poor mother caught between your eyes and Mr. Hannon's legs. Can I go to the hospital to see Mr. Hannon? They might not let you in but surely you can come here to see him. God knows he won't be doing much but reading and looking out the window. Mam tells me at home, You shouldn't cry but then again tears are salty and they'll wash the bad stuff from your eyes. XII There's a letter from Dad. He's coming home two days before Christmas. He says everything will be different, he's a new man, he hopes we're good boys, obeying our mother, attending to our religious duties, and he's bringing us all something for Christmas. Mam takes me to the railway station to meet him. The station is always exciting with all the coming and going, people leaning from carriages, crying, smiling, waving good-bye, the train hooting and calling, chugging away in clouds of steam, people sniffling on the platform, the railway tracks silvering into the distance, on to Dublin and the world beyond. Now it's near midnight and cold on the empty platform. A man in a railway cap asks us if we'd like to wait in a warm place. Mam says, Thank you very much, and laughs when he leads us to the end of the platform where we have to climb a ladder to the signal tower. It takes her a while because she's heavy and she keeps saying, Oh, God, oh, God. We're above the world and it's dark in the signal tower except for the lights that blink red and green and yellow when the man bends over the board. He says, I'm just having a bit of supper and you're welcome. Mam says, Ah, no, thanks, we couldn't take your supper from you. He says, The wife always makes too much for me and if I was up in this tower for a week I wouldn't be able to eat it. Sure it's not hard work looking at lights and pulling on the odd lever. He takes the top off a flask and pours cocoa into a mug. Here, he says to me, put yourself outside that cocoa. He hands Mam half a sandwich. Ah, no, she says, surely you could take that home to your children. I have two sons, missus, and they're off there fighting in the forces of His Majesty, the King of England. One did his bit with Montgomery in Africa and the other is over in Burma or some other bloody place, excuse the language. We get our freedom from England and then we fight her wars. So here, missus, take the bit of sandwich. Lights on the board are clicking and the man says, Your train is coming, missus. Thank you very much and Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas to yourself, missus, and a Happy New Year, too. Mind yourself on that ladder, young fella. Help your mother. Thank you very much, sir. We wait again on the platform while the train rumbles into the station. Carriage doors open and a few men with suitcases step to the platform and hurry toward the gate. There is a clanking of milk cans dropped to the platform. A man and two boys are unloading newspapers and magazines. There is no sign of my father. Mam says he might be asleep in one of the carriages but we know he hardly sleeps even in his own bed. She says the boat from Holyhead might have been late and that would make him miss the train. The Irish Sea is desperate at this time of the year. He's not coming, Mam. He doesn't care about us. He's just drunk over there in England. Don't talk about your father like that. I say no more to her. I don't tell her I wish I had a father like the man in the signal tower who gives you sandwiches and cocoa. Next day Dad walks in the door. His top teeth are missing and there's a bruise under his left eye. He says the Irish Sea was rough and when he leaned over the side his teeth dropped out. Mam says, It wouldn't be the drink, would it? It wouldn't be a fight? Och, no, Angela. Michael says, You said you'd have something for us, Dad. Oh, I do. He takes a box of chocolates from his suitcase and hands it to Mam. She opens the box and shows us the inside where half the chocolates are gone. Could you spare it? she says. She shuts the box and puts it on the mantelpiece. We'll have chocolates after our Christmas dinner tomorrow. Mam asks him if he brought any money. He tells her times are hard, jobs are scarce, and she says, Is it coddin' me you are? There's a war on and there's nothing but jobs in England. You drank the money, didn't you? You drank the money, Dad. You drank the money, Dad. You drank the money, Dad. We're shouting so loud Alphie begins to cry. Dad says, Och, boys, now boys. Respect for your father. He puts on his cap. He has to see a man. Mam says, Go see your man but don't come drunk to this house tonight singing Roddy McCorley or anything else. He comes home drunk but he's quiet and passes out on the floor next to Mam's bed. We have a Christmas dinner next day because of the food voucher Mam got from the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We have sheep's head, cabbage, floury white potatoes, and a bottle of cider because it's Christmas. Dad says he's not hungry, he'll have tea, borrows a cigarette from Mam. She says, Eat something. It's Christmas. He tells her again he's not hungry but if no one else wants them he'll eat the sheep's eyes. He says there's great nourishment in the eye and we all make sounds of disgust. He washes them down with his tea and smokes the rest of his Woodbine. He puts on his cap and goes upstairs for his suitcase. Mam says, Where are you going? London. On this day of Our Lord? Christmas Day? It's the best day for travel. People in motor cars will always give the workingman a lift to Dublin. They think of the hard times of the Holy Family. And how will you get on the boat to Holyhead without a penny in your pocket? The way I came. There's always a time when they're not looking. He kisses each of us on the forehead, tells us be good boys, obey Mam, say our prayers. He tells Mam he'll write and she says, Oh, yes, the way you always did. He stands before her with his suitcase. She gets up, takes down the box of chocolates and hands them around. She puts a chocolate in her mouth and takes it out again because it's too hard and she can't chew it. I have a soft one and I offer it for the hard one, which will last longer. It's creamy and rich and there's a nut in the middle. Malachy and Michael complain they didn't get a nut and why is it Frank always gets the nut? Mam says, What do you mean, always? This is the first time we ever had a box of chocolates. Malachy says, He got the raisin in the bun at school and all the boys said he gave it to Paddy Clohessy, so why couldn't he give us the nut? Mam says, Because 'tis Christmas and he has sore eyes and the nut is good for the sore eyes. Michael says, Will the nut make his eyes better? 'Twill. Will it make one eye better or will it make two eyes better? The two eyes, I think. Malachy says, If I had another nut I'd give it to him for his eyes. Mam says, I know you would. Dad watches us a moment eating our chocolates. He lifts the latch, goes out the door and pulls it shut. Mam tells Bridey Hannon, Days are bad but nights are worse and will this rain ever stop? She tries to ease the bad days by staying in bed and letting Malachy and me light the fire in the morning while she sits up in the bed passing Alphie bits of bread and holding the mug to his mouth for the tea that's in it. We have to go downstairs to Ireland to wash our faces in the basin under the tap and try to dry ourselves in the old damp shirt that hangs over the back of a chair. She makes us stand by the bed to see if we left rings of dirt around our necks and if we did it's back down to the tap and the damp shirt. When there's a hole in a pair of pants she sits up and patches it with any rag she can find. We wear short pants till we're thirteen or fourteen and our long stockings always have holes to be darned. If she has no wool for the darning and the stockings are dark we can blacken our ankles with shoe polish for the respectability that's in it. It's a terrible thing to walk the world with skin showing through the holes of our stockings. When we wear them week after week the holes grow so big we have to pull the stocking forward under the toes so that the hole in the back is hidden in the shoe. On rainy days the stockings are soggy and we have to hang them before the fire at night and hope they'll dry by morning. Then they're hard with dirt cake and we're afraid to pull them on our feet for fear they'll fall on the floor in bits before our eyes. We might be lucky enough to get our stockings on but then we have to block the holes in our shoes and I fight with my brother, Malachy, over any scrap of cardboard or paper in the house. Michael is only six and he has to wait for anything left over unless Mam threatens us from the bed that we're to help our small brother. She says, If ye don't fix yeer brother's shoes an' I have to get out of this bed there will be wigs on the green. You'd have to feel sorry for Michael because he's too old to play with Alphie and too young to play with us and he can't fight with anyone for the same reasons. The rest of the dressing is easy, the shirt I wore to bed is the shirt I wear to school. I wear it day in day out. It's the shirt for football, for climbing walls, for robbings orchards. I go to Mass and the Confraternity in that shirt and people sniff the air and move away. If Mam gets a docket for a new one at the St. Vincent de Paul the old shirt is promoted to towel and hangs damp on the chair for months or Mam might use bits of it to patch other shirts. She might even cut it up and let Alphie wear it a while before it winds up on the floor pushed against the bottom of the door to block the rain from the lane. We go to school through lanes and back streets so that we won't meet the respectable boys who go to the Christian Brothers'School or the rich ones who go to the Jesuit school, Crescent College. The Christian Brothers' boys wear tweed jackets, warm woolen sweaters, shirts, ties and shiny new boots. We know they're the ones who will get jobs in the civil service and help the people who run the world. The Crescent College boys wear blazers and school scarves tossed around their necks and over their shoulders to show they're cock o' the walk. They have long hair which falls across their foreheads and over their eyes so that they can toss their quiffs like Englishmen. We know they're the ones who will go to university, take over the family business, run the government, run the world. We'll be the messenger boys on bicycles who deliver their groceries or we'll go to England to work on the building sites. Our sisters will mind their children and scrub their floors unless they go off to England, too. We know that. We're ashamed of the way we look and if boys from the rich schools pass remarks we'll get into a fight and wind up with bloody noses or torn clothes. Our masters will have no patience with us and our fights because their sons go to the rich schools and, Ye have no right to raise your hands to a better class of people so ye don't. You never know when you might come home and find Mam sitting by the fire chatting with a woman and a child, strangers. Always a woman and child. Mam finds them wandering the streets and if they ask, Could you spare a few pennies, miss? her heart breaks. She never has money so she invites them home for tea and a bit of fried bread and if it's a bad night she'll let them sleep by the fire on a pile of rags in the corner. The bread she gives them always means less for us and if we complain she says there are always people worse off and we can surely spare a little from what we have. Michael is just as bad. He brings home stray dogs and old men. You never know when you'll find a dog in the bed with him. There are dogs with sores, dogs with no ears, no tails. There's a blind greyhound he found in the park tormented by children. Michael fought off the children, picked up the greyhound that was bigger than himself and told Mam the dog could have his supper. Mam says, What supper? We're lucky if there's a cut of bread in the house. Michael tells her the dog can have his bread. Mam says that dog has to go tomorrow and Michael cries all night and cries worse in the morning when he finds the dog dead in the bed beside him. He won't go to school because he has to dig a grave outside where the stable was and he wants all of us to dig with him and say the rosary. Malachy says it's useless saying prayers for a dog, how do you know he was even a Catholic? Michael says, Of course he was a Catholic dog. Didn't I have him in my arms? He cries so hard over the dog Mam lets us all stay at home from school. We're so delighted we don't mind helping Michael with the grave and we say three Hail Marys. We're not going to stand there wasting a good day off from school saying the rosary for a dead greyhound. Michael is only six but when he brings old men home he manages to get the fire going and give them tea. Mam says it's driving her crazy to come home and find these old men drinking out of her favorite mug and mumbling and scratching by the fire. She tells Bridey Hannon that Michael has a habit of bringing home old men all a bit gone in the head and if he doesn't have a bit of bread for them he knocks on neighbors' doors and has no shame begging for it. In the end she tells Michael, No more old men. One of them left us with lice and we're plagued. The lice are disgusting, worse than rats. They're in our heads and ears and they sit in the hollows of our collarbones. They dig into our skin. They get into the seams of our clothes and they're everywhere in the coats we use as blankets. We have to search every inch of Alphie's body because he's a baby and helpless. The lice are worse than the fleas. Lice squat and suck and we can see our blood through their skins. Fleas jump and bite and they're clean and we prefer them. Things that jump are cleaner than things that squat. We all agree there will be no more stray women and children, dogs and old men. We don't want any more diseases and infections. Michael cries. Grandma's next-door neighbor, Mrs. Purcell, has the only wireless in her lane. The government gave it to her because she's old and blind. I want a radio. My grandmother is old but she's not blind and what's the use of having a grandmother who won't go blind and get a government radio? Sunday nights I sit outside on the pavement under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to plays on the BBC and Radio Eireann, the Irish station. You can hear plays by O'Casey, Shaw, Ibsen and Shakespeare himself, the best of all, even if he is English. Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes, you can never get enough of him. And you can hear strange plays about Greeks plucking out their eyes because they married their mothers by mistake. One night I'm sitting under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to Macbeth. Her daughter, Kathleen, sticks her head out the door. Come in, Frankie. My mother says you'll catch the consumption sitting on the ground in this weather. Ah, no, Kathleen. It's all right. No. Come in. They give me tea and a grand cut of bread slathered with blackberry jam. Mrs. Purcell says, Do you like the Shakespeare, Frankie? I love the Shakespeare, Mrs. Purcell. Oh, he's music, Frankie, and he has the best stories in the world. I don't know what I'd do with meself of a Sunday night if I didn't have the Shakespeare. When the play finishes she lets me fiddle with the knob on the radio and I roam the dial for distant sounds on the shortwave band, strange whispering and hissing, the whoosh of the ocean coming and going and the Morse Code dit dit dit dot. I hear mandolins, guitars, Spanish bagpipes, the drums of Africa, boatmen wailing on the Nile. I see sailors on watch sipping mugs of hot cocoa. I see cathedrals, skyscrapers, cottages. I see Bedouins in the Sahara and the French Foreign Legion, cowboys on the American prairie. I see goats skipping along the rocky coast of Greece where the shepherds are blind because they married their mothers by mistake. I see people chatting in cafés, sipping wine, strolling on boulevards and avenues. I see night women in doorways, monks chanting vespers, and here is the great boom of Big Ben, This is the BBC Overseas Service and here is the news. Mrs. Purcell says, Leave that on, Frankie, so we'll know the state of the world. After the news there is the American Armed Forces Network and it's lovely to hear the American voices easy and cool and here is the music, oh, man, the music of Duke Ellington himself telling me take the A train to where Billie Holiday sings only to me, I can't give you anything but love, baby. That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby. Oh, Billie, Billie, I want to be in America with you and all that music, where no one has bad teeth, people leave food on their plates, every family has a lavatory, and everyone lives happily ever after. And Mrs. Purcell says, Do you know what, Frankie? What, Mrs. Purcell? That Shakespeare is that good he must have been an Irishman. The rent man is losing his patience. He tells Mam, Four weeks behind you are, missus. That's one pound two shillings. This has to stop for I have to go back to the office and report to Sir Vincent Nash that the McCourts are a month behind. Where am I then, missus? Out on my arse jobless and a mother to support that's ninety-two and a daily communicant in the Franciscan church. The rent man collects the rents, missus, or he loses the job. I'll be back next week and if you don't have the money, one pound eight shillings and sixpence total, 'tis out on the pavement you'll be with the skies dripping on your furniture. Mam comes back up to Italy and sits by the fire wondering where in God's name she'll get the money for a week's rent never mind the arrears. She'd love a cup of tea but there's no way of boiling the water till Malachy pulls a loose board off the wall between the two upstairs rooms. Mam says, Well, 'tis off now and we might as well chop it up for the fire. We boil the water and use the rest of the wood for the morning tea but what about tonight and tomorrow and ever after? Mam says, One more board from that wall, one more and not another one. She says that for two weeks till there's nothing left but the beam frame. She warns us we are not to touch the beams for they hold up the ceiling and the house itself. Oh, we'd never touch the beams. She goes to see Grandma and it's so cold in the house I take the hatchet to one of the beams. Malachy cheers me on and Michael claps his hands with excitement. I pull on the beam, the ceiling groans and down on Mam's bed there's a shower of plaster, slates, rain. Malachy says, Oh, God, we'll all be killed, and Michael dances around singing, Frankie broke the house, Frankie broke the house. We run through the rain to tell Mam the news. She looks puzzled with Michael chanting, Frankie broke the house, till I explain there's a hole in the house and it's falling down. She says, Jesus, and runs through the streets with Grandma trying to keep up. Mam sees her bed buried under plaster and slates and pulls at her hair, What'll we do at all, at all? and screams at me for interfering with the beams. Grandma says, I'll go to the landlord's office and tell them fix this before ye are all drowned entirely. She's back in no time with the rent man. He says, Great God in heaven, where's the other room? Grandma says, What room? I rented ye two rooms up here and one is gone. Where is that room? Mam says, What room? There were two rooms up here and now there's one. And what happened to the wall? There was a wall. Now there's no wall. I distinctly remember a wall because I distinctly remember a room. Now where is that wall? Where is that room? Grandma says, I don't remember a wall and if I don't remember a wall how can I remember a room? Ye don't remember? Well, I remember. Forty years a landlord's agent and I never seen the likes of this. By God, 'tis a desperate situation altogether when you can't turn your back but tenants are not paying their rent and making walls and rooms disappear on top of it. I want to know where that wall is and what ye did with the room, so I do. Mam turns to us. Do any of ye remember a wall? Michael pulls at her hand. Is that the wall we burned in the fire? The rent man says, Dear God in heaven, this beats Banagher, this takes the bloody biscuit, this is goin' beyond the beyonds. No rent and what am I to tell Sir Vincent below in the office? Out, missus, I'm puttin' ye out. One week from today I'll knock on this door and I want to find nobody at home, everybody out never to return. Do you have me, missus? Mam's face is tight. 'Tis a pity you weren't alive in the times when the English were evicting us and leaving us on the side of the road. No lip, missus, or I'll send the men to put ye out tomorrow. He goes out the door and leaves it open to show what he thinks of us. Mam says, I don't know in God's name what I'm going to do. Grandma says, Well, I don't have room for ye but your cousin, Gerard Griffin, is living out the Rosbrien Road in that little house of his mother's and he'd surely be able to take ye in till better times come. 'Tis all hours of the night but I'll go up and see what he says and Frank can come with me. She tells me put on a coat but I don't have one and she says, I suppose there's no use in asking if ye have an umbrella either. Come on. She pulls the shawl over her head and I follow her out the door, up the lane, through the rain to Rosbrien Road nearly two miles away. She knocks on the door of a little cottage in a long row of little cottages. Are you there, Laman? I know you're in there. Open the door. Grandma, why are you calling him Laman? Isn't his name Gerard? How would I know? Do I know why the world calls your uncle Pat Ab? Everyone calls this fella Laman. Open the door. We'll go in. He might be working overtime. She pushes the door. It's dark and there's a damp sweet smell in the room. This room looks like the kitchen and there's a smaller room next to it. There's a little loft above the bedroom with a skylight where the rain is beating. There are boxes everywhere, newspapers, magazines, bits of food, mugs, empty tins. We can see two beds taking up all the space in the bedroom, a great acre of a bed and a smaller one near the window. Grandma pokes at a lump in the big bed. Laman, is that you? Get up, will you, get up. What? What? What? What? There's trouble. Angela is gettin' evicted with the children an' 'tis delvin'out of the heavens. They need a bit of shelter till they get on their feet an' I have no room for them. You can put them up in the loft if you like but that wouldn't do because the small ones wouldn't be able to climb and they'd fall down an' get killed so you go up there an' they can move in here. All right, all right, all right, all right. He hoists himself from the bed and there's a whiskey smell. He goes to the kitchen and pulls the table to the wall for his climb to the loft. Grandma says, That's fine now. Ye can move up here tonight an' ye won't have the eviction men coming after ye. Grandma tells Mam she's going home. She's tired and drenched and she's not twenty-five anymore. She says there's no need to be taking beds or furniture with all the stuff that's up in Laman Griffin's. We put Alphie in the pram and pile around him the pot, the pan, the kettle, the jam jars and mugs, the Pope, two bolsters and the coats from the beds. We drape the coats over our heads and push the pram through the streets. Mam tells us be quiet going up the lane or the neighbors will know we got the eviction and there will be shame. The pram has a bockety wheel which tilts it and makes it go in different directions. We try to keep it straight and we're having a great time because it must be after midnight and surely Mam won't make us go to school tomorrow. We're moving so far from Leamy's School now maybe we'll never have to go again. Once we get away from the lane Alphie bangs on the pot with the spoon and Michael sings a song he heard in a film with Al Jolson, Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya, my dear ol'Swanee. He makes us laugh the way he tries to sing in a deep voice like Al Jolson. Mam says she's glad it's late and there's no one on the streets to see our shame. Once we get to the house we take Alphie and everything else from the pram so that Malachy and I can run back down to Roden Lane for the trunk. Mam says she'd die if she lost that trunk and everything in it. Malachy and I sleep at opposite ends of the small bed. Mam takes the big bed with Alphie beside her and Michael at the bottom. Everything is damp and musty and Laman Griffin snores over our heads. There are no stairs in this house and that means no angel ever on the seventh step. But I'm twelve going on thirteen and I might be too old for angels. It's still dark when the alarm goes off in the morning and Laman Griffin snorts and blows his nose and hawks the stuff from his chest. The floor creaks under him and when he pisses for ages into the chamber pot we have to stuff our mouths with coats to stop the laughing and Mam hisses at us to be quiet. He grumbles away above us before he climbs down to get his bicycle and bang his way out the door. Mam whispers, The coast is clear, go back to sleep. Ye can stay at home today. We can't sleep. We're in a new house, we have to pee and we want to explore. The lavatory is outside, about ten steps from the back door, our own lavatory, with a door you can close and a proper seat where you can sit and read squares of the Limerick Leader Laman Griffin left behind for wiping himself. There is a long backyard, a garden with tall grass and weeds, an old bicycle that must have belonged to a giant, tin cans galore, old papers and magazines rotting into the earth, a rusted sewing machine, a dead cat with a rope around his neck that somebody must have thrown over the fence. Michael gets a notion in his head that this is Africa and keeps asking, Where's Tarzan? Where's Tarzan? He runs up and down the backyard with no pants on trying to imitate Tarzan yodeling from tree to tree. Malachy looks over the fences into the other yards and tells us, They have gardens. They're growing things. We can grow things. We can have our own spuds and everything. Mam calls from the back door, See if ye can find anything to start the fire in here. There's a wooden shed built against the back of the house. It's collapsing and surely we could use some of the wood for the fire. Mam is disgusted with the wood we bring in. She says it's rotten and full of white maggots but beggars can't be choosers. The wood sizzles above the burning paper and we watch the white maggots try to escape. Michael says he feels sorry for the white maggots but we know he's sorry for everything in the world. Mam tells us this house used to be a shop, that Laman Griffin's mother sold groceries through the little window and that's how she was able to send Laman away to Rockwell College so that he could wind up as an officer in the Royal Navy. Oh, he was, indeed. An officer in the Royal Navy, and here's a picture of him with other officers all having dinner with a famous American film star Jean Harlow. He was never the same after he met Jean Harlow. He fell madly in love with her but what was the use? She was Jean Harlow and he was nothing but an officer in the Royal Navy and it drove him to drink and they threw him out of the Navy. Now look at him, a common laborer for the Electricity Supply Board and a house that's a disgrace. You'd look at this house and never know there was a human being living in it. You can see Laman never moved a thing since his mother died and now we have to clean up so that we can live in this place. There are boxes packed with bottles of purple hair oil. While Mam is out in the lavatory we open a bottle and smear it on our heads. Malachy says the smell is gorgeous but when Mam comes back she says, What's that horrible stink? and wants to know why our heads are suddenly greasy. She makes us stick our heads under the tap outside and dry ourselves with an old towel pulled out from under a pile of magazines called The Illustrated London News so old they have pictures of Queen Victoria and Prince Edward waving. There are bars of Pear's soap and a thick book called Pear's Encyclopedia, which keeps me up day and night because it tells you everything about everything and that's all I want to know. There are bottles of Sloan's Liniment, which Mam says will come in handy when we get cramps and pains from the damp. The bottles say, Here's the pain, Where's the Sloan's? There are boxes of safety pins and bags packed with women's hats that crumble when you touch them. There are bags with corsets, garters, women's high button shoes and different laxatives that promise glowing cheeks, bright eyes and a curl in your hair. There are letters from General Eoin O'Duffy to Gerard Griffin, Esq., saying welcome to the ranks of the National Front, the Irish Blueshirts, that it is a privilege to know a man like Gerard Griffin is interested in the movement with his excellent education, his Royal Navy training, his reputation as a great rugby player on the Young Munster team that won the national championship, the Bateman Cup. General O'Duffy is forming an Irish Brigade that will soon sail off to Spain to fight with that great Catholic Generalissimo Franco himself, and Mr. Griffin would be a powerful addition to the Brigade. Mam says Laman's mother wouldn't let him go. She didn't spend all those years slaving away in a little shop to send him to college so that he could go gallivanting off to Spain for Franco so he stayed at home and got that job digging holes for the poles of the Electricity Supply Board along country roads and his mother was happy to have him home to herself every night but Friday when he drank his pint and moaned over Jean Harlow. Mam is happy we'll have loads of paper for lighting the fire though the wood we burn from that collapsing shed leaves a sickening smell and she worries the white maggots will escape and breed. We work all day moving boxes and bags to the shed outside. Mam opens all the windows to air the house and let out the smell of the hair oil and the years of no air. She says it's a relief to be able to see the floor again and now we can sit down and have a nice cup of tea in peace, ease and comfort, and won't it be lovely when the warm weather comes and we might be able to have a garden and sit outside with our tea the way the English do. Laman Griffin comes home at six every night but Friday, has his tea and goes to bed till next morning. Saturdays he goes to bed at one in the afternoon and stays there till Monday morning. He pulls the kitchen table over to the wall under the loft, climbs up on a chair, pulls the chair up to the table, climbs up on the chair again, catches a leg of the bed, pulls himself up. If he's too drunk on Fridays he makes me climb up for his pillow and blankets and sleeps on the kitchen floor by the fire or falls into bed with me and my brothers and snores and farts all night. When we first moved in he complained over how he gave up his room downstairs for the loft and he's worn out climbing up and down to go to the lavatory in the backyard. He calls down, Bring the table, the chair, I'm coming down, and we have to clear off the table and pull it to the wall. He's fed up, he's finished with the climbing, he's going to use his mother's lovely chamber pot. He lies in bed all day reading books from the library, smoking Gold Flake cigarettes and throwing Mam a few shillings to send one of us to the shop so that he can have scones with his tea or a nice bit of ham and sliced tomato. Then he calls to Mam, Angela, this chamber pot is full, and she drags chair and table to climb for the chamber pot, empty it in the lavatory outside, rinse it and climb back to the loft. Her face gets tight and she says, Is there anything else your lordship would like this day? and he laughs, Woman's work, Angela, woman's work and free rent. Laman throws down his library card from the loft and tells me get him two books, one on angling, one on gardening. He writes a note to the librarian to say his legs are killing him from digging holes for the Electricity Supply Board and from now on Frank McCourt will be getting his books. He knows the boy is only thirteen going on fourteen and he knows the rules are strict about allowing children into the adult part of the library but the boy will wash his hands and behave himself and do what he's told, thank you. The librarian reads the note and says 'tis an awful pity about Mr. Griffin, he's a true gentleman and a man of great learning, you wouldn't believe the books he reads, sometimes four a week, that one day he took home a book in French, French, if you don't mind, on the history of the rudder, the rudder, if you don't mind, she'd give anything for a look inside his head for it must be packed with all sorts of learning, packed, if you don't mind. She picks out a gorgeous book with colored pictures about English gardens. She says, I know what he likes in the fishing department, and chooses a book called In Search of the Irish Salmon by Brigadier General Hugh Colton. Oh, says the librarian, he reads hundreds of books about English officers fishing in Ireland. I've read some myself out of pure curiosity and you can see why those officers are glad to be in Ireland after all they put up with in India and Africa and other desperate places. At least the people here are polite. We're known for that, the politeness, not running around throwing spears at people. Laman lies in the bed, reads his books, talks down from the loft about the day his legs will heal and he'll be out there in the back planting a garden which will be famous far and wide for color and beauty and when he's not gardening he'll be roaming the rivers around Limerick and bringing home salmon that will make your mouth water. His mother left a recipe for salmon that's a family secret and if he had the time and his legs weren't killing him he'd find it someplace in this house. He says now that I'm reliable I can get a book for myself every week but don't be bringing home filth. I want to know what the filth is but he won't tell me so I'll have to find out for myself. Mam says she wants to join the library too but it's a long walk from Laman's house, two miles, and would I mind getting her a book every week, a romance by Charlotte M. Brame or any other nice writer. She doesn't want any books about English officers looking for salmon or books about people shooting each other. There's enough trouble in the world without reading about people bothering fish and each other. Grandma caught a chill the night we had the trouble in the house in Roden Lane and the chill turned into pneumonia. They shifted her to the City Home Hospital and now she's dead. Her oldest son, my uncle Tom, thought he'd go to England to work like other men in the lanes of Limerick but his consumption got worse and he came back to Limerick and now he's dead. His wife, Galway Jane, followed him, and four of their six children had to be put into orphanages. The oldest boy, Gerry, ran away and joined the Irish army, deserted and crossed to the English army. The oldest girl, Peggy, went to Aunt Aggie and lives in misery. The Irish army is looking for boys who are musical and would like to train in the Army School of Music. They accept my brother, Malachy, and he goes off to Dublin to be a soldier and play the trumpet. Now I have only two brothers at home and Mam says her family is disappearing before her very eyes. XIII Boys from my class at Leamy's School are going on a weekend cycling trip to Killaloe. They tell me I should borrow a bicycle and come. All I need is a blanket, a few spoons of tea and sugar and a few cuts of bread to keep me going. I'll learn to cycle on Laman Griffin's bicycle every night after he goes to bed and he'll surely let me borrow it for the two days in Killaloe. The best time to ask him for anything is Friday night when he's in a good mood after his night of drinking and his dinner. He brings home the same dinner in his overcoat pockets, a big steak dripping blood, four potatoes, an onion, a bottle of stout. Mam boils the potatoes and fries the steak with sliced onion. He keeps his overcoat on, sits at the table and eats the steak out of his hands. The grease and blood roll down his chin and on to the overcoat where he wipes his hands. He drinks his stout and laughs that there's nothing like a great bloody steak of a Friday night and if that's the worst sin he ever commits he'll float to heaven body and soul, ha ha ha. Of course you can have my bike, he says. Boy should be able to get out and see the countryside. Of course. But you have to earn it. You can't be getting something for nothing, isn't that right? 'Tis. And I have a job for you. You don't mind doing a bit of a job, do you? I don't. And you'd like to help your mother? I would. Well, now, that very chamber pot is full since this morning. I want you to climb up and get it and take it to the lavatory and rinse it under the tap abroad and climb back up with it. I don't want to empty his chamber pot but I dream of cycling miles on the road to Killaloe, fields and sky far from this house, a swim in the Shannon, a night sleeping in a barn. I pull the table and chair to the wall. I climb up and under the bed there's the plain white chamber pot streaked brown and yellow, brimming with piss and shit. I lay it gently at the edge of the loft so that it won't spill, climb down to the chair, reach for the chamber pot, bring it down, turn my face away, hold it while I step down to the table, place it on the chair, step to the floor, take the chamber pot to the lavatory, empty it, and get sick behind the lavatory till I get used to this job. Laman says I'm a good boy and the bike is mine anytime I want it as long as the chamber pot is empty and I'm there to run to the shop for his cigarettes, go to the library for books and do whatever else he wants. He says, You have a great way with a chamber pot. He laughs and Mam stares into the dead ashes in the fireplace. It's raining so hard one day, Miss O'Riordan the librarian says, Don't go out in that or you'll ruin the books you're carrying. Sit down over there and behave yourself. You can read all about the saints while you're waiting. There are four big books, Butler's Lives of the Saints. I don't want to spend my life reading about saints but when I start I wish the rain would last forever. Whenever you see pictures of saints, men or women, they're always looking up to heaven where there are clouds filled with little fat angels carrying flowers or harps giving praise. Uncle Pa Keating says he can't think of a single saint in heaven he'd want to sit down and have a pint with. The saints in these books are different. There are stories about virgins, martyrs, virgin martyrs and they're worse than any horror film at the Lyric Cinema. I have to look in the dictionary to find out what a virgin is. I know the Mother of God is the Virgin Mary and they call her that because she didn't have a proper husband, only poor old St. Joseph. In the Lives of the Saints the virgins are always getting into trouble and I don't know why. The dictionary says, Virgin, woman (usually a young woman) who is and remains in a state of inviolate chastity. Now I have to look up inviolate and chastity and all I can find here is that inviolate means not violated and chastity means chaste and that means pure from unlawful sexual intercourse. Now I have to look up intercourse and that leads to intromission, which leads to intromittent, the copulatory organ of any male animal. Copulatory leads to copulation, the union of the sexes in the art of generation and I don't know what that means and I'm too weary going from one word to another in this heavy dictionary which leads me on a wild goose chase from this word to that word and all because the people who wrote the dictionary don't want the likes of me to know anything. All I want to know is where I came from but if you ask anyone they tell you ask someone else or send you from word to word. All these virgin martyrs are told by Roman judges they have to give up their faith and accept the Roman gods but they say, Nay, and the judges have them tortured and killed. My favorite is St. Christina the Astonishing who takes ages to die. The judge says, Cut off her breast, and when they do she throws it at him and he goes deaf dumb and blind. Another judge is brought on the case and he says, Cut off the other breast, and the same thing happens. They try to kill her with arrows but they just bounce off her and kill the soldiers who shot them. They try to boil her in oil but she rocks in the vat and takes a nap for herself. Then the judges get fed up and have her head cut off and that does the job. The feast of St. Christina the Astonishing is the twenty-fourth of July and I think I'll keep that for myself along with the feast of St. Francis of Assisi on the fourth of October. The librarian says, You have to go home now, the rain is stopped, and when I'm going out the door she calls me back. She wants to write a note to my mother and she doesn't mind one bit if I read it. The note says, Dear Mrs. McCourt, Just when you think Ireland is gone to the dogs altogether you find a boy sitting in the library so absorbed in the Lives of the Saints he doesn't realize the rain has stopped and you have to drag him away from the aforesaid Lives. I think, Mrs. McCourt, you might have a future priest on your hands and I will light a candle in hopes it comes true. I remain, Yours truly, Catherine O'Riordan, Asst. Librarian. Hoppy O'Halloran is the only master in Leamy's National School who ever sits. That's because he's the headmaster or because he has to rest himself from the twisting walk that comes from the short leg. The other masters walk back and forth in the front of the room or up and down the aisles and you never know when you'll get a whack of a cane or a slap of a strap for giving the wrong answer or writing something sloppy. If Hoppy wants to do anything to you he calls you to the front of the room to punish you before three classes. There are good days when he sits at the desk and talks about America. He says, My boys, from the frozen wastes of North Dakota to the fragrant orange groves of Florida, Americans enjoy all climates. He talks about American history, If the American farmer, with flintlock and musket, could wrest from the English a continent, surely we, warriors ever, can recover our island. If we don't want him tormenting us with algebra or Irish grammar all we have to do is ask him a question about America and that gets him so excited he might go on for the whole day. He sits at his desk and recites the tribes and chiefs he loves. Arapaho, Cheyenne, Chippewa, Sioux, Apache, Iroquois. Poetry, my boys, poetry. And listen to the chiefs, Kicking Bear, Rain-in-the-Face, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the genius, Geronimo. In seventh class he hands out a small book, a poem that goes on for pages and pages, The Deserted Village, by Oliver Goldsmith. He says that this seems to be a poem about England but it is a lament for the poet's native land, our own native land, Ireland. We are to get this poem by heart, twenty lines a night to be recited every morning. Six boys are called to the front of the room for reciting and if you miss a line you are slapped twice on each hand. He tells us put the books under the desks and the whole class chants the passage on the schoolmaster in the village. Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way, With blossomed furze unprofitably gay, There, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule The village master taught his little school. A man severe he was and stern to view, I knew him well, and every truant knew. Full well the boding tremblers learned to trace The day's disaster in his morning face. Full well they laughed with counterfeited glee At all his jokes for many a joke had he. Full well the busy whisper circling round Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned. He always closes his eyes and smiles when we reach the last lines of the passage, Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught, The love he bore to learning was in fault. The village all declared how much he knew. 'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too. Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage, And even the story ran that he could gauge. In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill, For, even though vanquished, he could argue still, While words of learned length and thundering sound Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around. And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, That one small head could carry all he knew. We know he loves these lines because they're about a schoolmaster, about him, and he's right because we wonder how one small head could carry all he knows and we will remember him in these lines. He says, Ah, boys, boys, You can make up your own minds but first stock them. Are you listening to me? Stock your minds and you can move through the world resplendent. Clarke, define resplendent. I think it's shining, sir. Pithy, Clarke, but adequate. McCourt, give us a sentence with pithy. Clarke is pithy but adequate, sir. Adroit, McCourt. You have a mind for the priesthood, my boy, or politics. Think of that. I will, sir. Tell your mother come and see me. I will, sir. Mam says, No, I could never go near Mr. O'Halloran. I don't have a decent dress or a proper coat. What does he want to see me for? I don't know. Well, ask him. I can't. He'll kill me. If he says bring your mother you have to bring your mother or out comes the stick. She comes to see him and he talks to her in the hallway. He tells her that her son Frank must continue school. He must not fall into the messenger boy trap. That leads nowhere. Take him up to the Christian Brothers, tell them I sent you, tell them he is a bright boy and ought to be going to secondary school and beyond that, university. He tells her he did not become headmaster of Leamy's National School to preside over an academy of messenger boys. Mam says, Thank you, Mr. O'Halloran. I wish Mr. O'Halloran would mind his own business. I don't want to go to the Christian Brothers. I want to quit school forever and get a job, get my wages every Friday, go to the pictures on Saturday nights like everyone. A few days later Mam tells me give my face and hands a good wash, we're going to the Christian Brothers. I tell her I don't want to go, I want to work, I want to be a man. She tells me stop the whining, I'm going to secondary school and we'll all manage somehow. I'm going to school if she has to scrub floors and she'll practice on my face. She knocks on the door at the Christian Brothers and says she wants to see the superior, Brother Murray. He comes to the door, looks at my mother and me and says, What? Mam says, This is my son, Frank. Mr. O'Halloran at Leamy's says he's bright and would there be any chance of getting him in here for secondary school? We don't have room for him, says Brother Murray and closes the door in our faces. Mam turns away from the door and it's a long silent walk home. She takes off her coat, makes tea, sits by the fire. Listen to me, she says. Are you listening? I am. That's the second time a door was slammed in your face by the Church. Is it? I don't remember. Stephen Carey told you and your father you couldn't and closed the door in your face. Do you remember that? I do. And now Brother Murray slams the door in your face. I don't mind. I want to get a job. Her face tightens and she's angry. You are never to be an altar boy let anybody slam the door in your face again. Do you hear me? She starts to cry by the fire, Oh, God, I didn't bring ye into the world to be a family of messenger boys. I don't know what to do or say, I'm so relieved I don't have to stay in school for five or six more years. I'm free. I'm thirteen going on fourteen and it's June, the last month of school forever. Mam takes me to see the priest, Dr. Cowpar, about getting a job as telegram boy. The supervisor in the post office, Mrs. O'Connell, says, Do you know how to cycle, and I lie that I do. She says I can't start till I'm fourteen so come back in August. Mr. O'Halloran tells the class it's a disgrace that boys like McCourt, Clarke, Kennedy, have to hew wood and draw water. He is disgusted by this free and independent Ireland that keeps a class system foisted on us by the English, that we are throwing our talented children on the dungheap. You must get out of this country, boys. Go to America, McCourt. Do you hear me? I do, sir. Priests come to the school to recruit us for the foreign missions, Redemptorists, Franciscans, Holy Ghost Fathers, all converting the distant heathen. I ignore them. I'm going to America till one priest catches my attention. He says he comes from the order of the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic Bedouin tribes and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion. I ask for the application. I will need a letter from the parish priest and a physical examination by my family doctor. The parish priest writes the letter on the spot. He would have been glad to see me go last year. The doctor says, What's this? That's an application to join the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic tribes of the Sahara and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion. Oh, yeh? French Foreign Legion, is it? Do you know the preferred form of transportation in the Sahara Desert? Trains? No. It's the camel. Do you know what a camel is? It has a hump. It has more than a hump. It has a nasty, mean disposition and its teeth are green with gangrene and it bites. Do you know where it bites? In the Sahara? No, you omadhaun. It bites your shoulder, rips it right off. Leaves you standing there tilted in the Sahara. How would you like that, eh? And what class of a spectacle you'd be strolling down the street, lopsided in Limerick. What girl in her right mind will look at an ex-White Father with one miserable scrawny shoulder? And look at your eyes. They're bad enough here in Limerick. In the Sahara they'll fester and rot and fall out of your head. How old are you? Thirteen. Go home to your mother. It's not our house and we don't feel free in it the way we did in Roden Lane, up in Italy or down in Ireland. When Laman comes home he wants to read in his bed or sleep and we have to be quiet. We stay in the streets till after dark and when we come inside there's nothing to do but go to bed and read a book if we have a candle or paraffin oil for the lamp. Mam tells us go to bed, she'll be after us in a minute as soon as she climbs to the loft with Laman's last mug of tea. We often fall asleep before she goes up but there are nights we hear them talking, grunting, moaning. There are nights when she never comes down and Michael and Alphie have the big bed to themselves. Malachy says she stays up there because it's too hard for her to climb down in the dark. He's only twelve and he doesn't understand. I'm thirteen and I think they're at the excitement up there. I know about the excitement and I know it's a sin but how can it be a sin if it comes to me in a dream where American girls pose in swimming suits on the screen at the Lyric Cinema and I wake up pushing and pumping? It's a sin when you're wide awake and going at yourself the way the boys talked about it in Leamy's schoolyard after Mr. O'Dea roared the Sixth Commandment at us, Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery, which means impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, and that's what adultery is, Dirty Things in General. One Redemptorist priest barks at us all the time about the Sixth Commandment. He says impurity is so grave a sin the Virgin Mary turns her face away and weeps. And why does she weep, boys? She weeps because of you and what you are doing to her Beloved Son. She weeps when she looks down the long dreary vista of time and beholds in horror the spectacle of Limerick boys defiling themselves, polluting themselves, interfering with themselves, abusing themselves, soiling their young bodies, which are the temples of the Holy Ghost. Our Lady weeps over these abominations knowing that every time you interfere with yourself you nail to the cross her Beloved Son, that once more you hammer into His dear head the crown of thorns, that you reopen those ghastly wounds. In an agony of thirst He hangs on the cross and what is He offered by those perfidious Romans? A lavatory sponge plunged into vinegar and gall and thrust into His poor mouth, a mouth that moves rarely except to pray, to pray even for you, boys, even for you who nailed Him to that cross. Consider Our Lord's suffering. Consider the crown of thorns. Consider a small pin driven into your skull, the agony of the piercing. Consider then twenty thorns driven into your head. Reflect, meditate on the nails tearing His hands, His feet. Could you endure a fraction of that agony? Take that pin again, that mere pin. Force it into your side. Enlarge that sensation a hundredfold and you are penetrated by that awful lance. Oh, boys, the devil wants your souls. He wants you with him in hell and know this, that every time you interfere with yourself, every time you succumb to the vile sin of self- abuse you not only nail Christ to the cross you take another step closer to hell itself. Retreat from the abyss, boys. Resist the devil and keep your hands to yourself. I can't stop interfering with myself. I pray to the Virgin Mary and tell her I'm sorry I put her Son back on the cross and I'll never do it again but I can't help myself and swear I'll go to confession and after that, surely after that, I'll never never do it again. I don't want to go to hell with devils chasing me for eternity jabbing me with hot pitchforks. The priests of Limerick have no patience with the likes of me. I go to confession and they hiss that I'm not in a proper spirit of repentance, that if I were I'd give up this hideous sin. I go from church to church looking for an easy priest till Paddy Clohessy tells me there's one in the Dominican church who's ninety years old and deaf as a turnip. Every few weeks the old priest hears my confession and mumbles that I should pray for him. Sometimes he falls asleep and I don't have the heart to wake him up so I go to Communion the next day without penance or absolution. It's not my fault if priests fall asleep on me and surely I'm in a state of grace just for going to confession. Then one day the little panel in the confession box slides back and it's not my man at all, it's a young priest with a big ear like a seashell. He'll surely hear everything. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession. And what have you done since then, my child? I hit my brother, I went on the mooch from school, I lied to my mother. Yes, my child, and what else? I – I - I did dirty things, Father. Ah, my child, was that with yourself or with another or with some class of beast? Some class of beast. I never heard of a sin like that before. This priest must be from the country and if he is he's opening up new worlds to me. The night before I'm to go to Killaloe Laman Griffin comes home drunk and eats a great bag of fish and chips at the table. He tells Mam boil water for tea and when she says she has no coal or turf he yells at her and calls her a great lump living free under his roof with her pack of brats. He throws money at me to go to the shop for a few sods of turf and wood for kindling. I don't want to go. I want to hit him for the way he treats my mother but if I say anything he won't let me have the bicycle tomorrow after I've waited three weeks. When Mam gets the fire going and boils the water I remind him of his promise to loan me the bike. Did you empty the chamber pot today? Oh, I forgot. I'll do it this minute. He shouts, You didn't empty my damn chamber pot. I promise you the bike. I give you tuppence a week to run messages for me and empty the chamber pot and you stand there with your thick gob hanging out and tell me you didn't do it. I'm sorry. I forgot. I'll do it now. You will, will you? And how do you think you'll get up to the loft? Are you going to pull the table out from under my fish and chips? Mam says, Sure, he was at school all day and he had to go to the doctor for his eyes. Well, you can bloody well forget about the bicycle. You didn't live up to the bargain. But he couldn't do it, says Mam. He tells her shut up and mind her own business and she goes quiet by the fire. He goes back to his fish and chips but I tell him again, You promised me. I emptied that chamber pot and did your messages for three weeks. Shut up and go to bed. You can't tell me go to bed. You're not my father, and you promised me. I'm telling you, as sure as God made little apples, that if I get up from this table you'll be calling for your patron saint. You promised me. He pushes the chair back from the table. He stumbles toward me and sticks his finger between my eyes. I'm telling you shut your gob, scabby eyes. I won't. You promised me. He punches my shoulders and when I won't stop moves to my head. My mother jumps up, crying, and tries to pull him away. He punches and kicks me into the bedroom but I keep saying, You promised me. He knocks me to my mother's bed and punches till I cover my face and head with my arms. I'll kill you, you little shit. Mam is screaming and pulling at him till he falls backward into the kitchen. She says, Come on, oh, come on. Eat your fish and chips. He's only a child. He'll get over it. I hear him go back to his chair and pull it to the table. I hear him snuffle and slurp when he eats and drinks. Hand me the matches, he says. By Jesus, I need a fag after that. There's a put-put sound when he puffs on the cigarette and a whimper from my mother. He says, I'm going to bed, and with the drink in him it takes him a while to climb the chair to the table, pull up the chair, climb to the loft. The bed squeaks under him and he grunts when he pulls off his boots and drops them to the floor. I can hear Mam crying when she blows into the globe of the paraffin oil lamp and everything goes dark. After what happened she'll surely want to get into her own bed and I'm ready to go to the small one against the wall. Instead, there's the sound of her climbing the chair, the table, the chair, crying up into the loft and telling Laman Griffin, He's only a boy, tormented with his eyes, and when Laman says, He's a little shit and I want him out of the house, she cries and begs till there's whispering and grunting and moaning and nothing. In awhile they're snoring in the loft and my brothers are asleep around me. I can't stay in this house for if Laman Griffin comes at me again I'll take a knife to his neck. I don't know what to do or where to go. I leave the house and follow the streets from the Sarsfield Barracks to the Monument Café. I dream of how I'll get back at Laman some day. I'll go to America and see Joe Louis. I'll tell him my troubles and he'll understand because he comes from a poor family. He'll show me how to build up my muscles, how to hold my hands and use my feet. He'll show me how to dig my chin into my shoulder the way he does and how to let go with a right uppercut that will send Laman flying. I'll drag Laman to the graveyard at Mungret where his family and Mam's family are buried and I'll cover him with earth all the way to his chin so that he won't be able to move and he'll beg for his life and I'll say, End of the road, Laman, you're going to meet your Maker, and he'll beg and beg while I trickle dirt on his face till it's covered completely and he's gasping and asking God for forgiveness for not giving me the bike and punching me all over the house and doing the excitement with my mother and I'll be laughing away because he's not in a state of grace after the excitement and he's going to hell as sure as God made little apples as he used to say himself. The streets are dark and I have to keep an eye out in case I might be lucky like Malachy long ago and find fish and chips dropped by drunken soldiers. There's nothing on the ground. If I find my uncle, Ab Sheehan, he might give me some of his Friday night fish and chips, but they tell me in the café he came and went already. I'm thirteen now so I don't call him Uncle Pat anymore. I call him Ab or The Abbot like everybody else. Surely if I go to Grandma's house he'll give me a piece of bread or something and maybe he'll let me stay the night. I can tell him I'll be working in a few weeks delivering telegrams and getting big tips at the post office and ready to pay my own way. He's sitting up in bed finishing his fish and chips, dropping to the floor the Limerick Leader they were wrapped in, wiping his mouth and hands with the blanket. He looks at me, That face is all swole. Did you fall on that face? I tell him I did because there's no use telling him anything else. He wouldn't understand. He says, You can stay in me mother's bed tonight. You can't walk the streets with that face and them two red eyes in your head. He says there's no food in the house, not a scrap of bread, and when he falls asleep I take the greasy newspaper from the floor. I lick the front page, which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city. I lick the headlines. I lick the great attacks of Patton and Montgomery in France and Germany. I lick the war in the Pacific. I lick the obituaries and the sad memorial poems, the sports pages, the market prices of eggs butter and bacon. I suck the paper till there isn't a smidgen of grease. I wonder what I'll do tomorrow. XIV In the morning The Abbot gives me the money to go to Kathleen O'Connell's for bread, margarine, tea, milk. He boils water on the gas ring and tells me I can have a mug of tea and, Go aisy with the sugar, I'm not a millionaire. You can have a cut o' bread but don't make it too thick. It's July and school is over forever. In a few weeks I'll be delivering telegrams at the post office, working like a man. In the weeks I'm idle I can do anything I like, get up in the morning, stay in bed, take long walks out the country like my father, wander around Limerick. If I had the money I'd go over to the Lyric Cinema, eat sweets, see Errol Flynn conquering everyone in sight. I can read the English and Irish papers The Abbot brings home or I can use the library cards of Laman Griffin and my mother till I'm found out. Mam sends Michael with a milk bottle of warm tea, a few cuts of bread smeared with dripping, a note to say Laman Griffin isn't angry anymore and I can come back. Michael says, Are you coming home, Frankie? No. Ah, do, Frankie. Come on. I live here now. I'm never going back. But Malachy is gone to the army and you're here and I have no big brother. All the boys have big brothers and I only have Alphie. He's not even four and can't talk right. I can't go back. I'm never going back. You can come here any time you like. His eyes glint with tears and that gives me such a pain in my heart I want to say, All right, I'll come with you. I'm only saying that. I know I'll never be able to face Laman Griffin again and I don't know if I can look at my mother. I watch Michael go up the lane with the sole of his shoe broken and clacking along the pavement. When I start that job at the post office I'll buy him shoes so I will. I'll give him an egg and take him to the Lyric Cinema for the film and the sweets and then we'll go to Naughton's and eat fish and chips till our bellies are sticking out a mile. I'll get money some day for a house or a flat with electric light and a lavatory and beds with sheets blankets pillows like the rest of the world. We'll have breakfast in a bright kitchen with flowers dancing in a garden beyond, delicate cups and saucers, eggcups, eggs soft in the yolk and ready to melt the rich creamery butter, a teapot with a cozy on it, toast with butter and marmalade galore. We'll take our time and listen to music from the BBC or the American Armed Forces Network. I'll buy proper clothes for the whole family so our arses won't be hanging out of our pants and we won't have the shame. The thought of the shame brings a pain in my heart and starts me sniffling. The Abbot says, What's up with you? Didn't you have your bread? Didn't you have your tay? What more do you want? 'Tis an egg you'll be lookin' for next. There's no use talking to someone who was dropped on his head and sells papers for a living. He complains he can't be feeding me forever and I'll have to get my own bread and tea. He doesn't want to come home and find me reading in the kitchen with the electric lightbulb blazing away. He can read numbers so he can and when he goes out to sell papers he reads the electric meter so he'll know how much I used and if I don't stop turning on that light he'll take the fuse out and carry it in his pocket and if I put another fuse in he'll have the electricity pulled out altogether and go back to gas, which was good enough for his poor dead mother and will surely suit him for all he does is sit up in the bed to eat his fish and chips and count his money before he goes to sleep. I get up early like Dad and go on long walks into the country. I walk around the graveyard in the old abbey at Mungret where my mother's relations are buried and I go up the boreen to the Norman castle at Carrigogunnell where Dad brought me twice. I climb to the top and Ireland is spread out before me, the Shannon shining its way to the Atlantic. Dad told me this castle was built hundreds of years ago and if you wait for the larks to stop their singing over there you can hear the Normans below hammering and talking and getting ready for battle. Once he brought me here in the dark so that we could hear Norman and Irish voices down through the centuries and I heard them. I did. Sometimes I'm up there alone on the heights of Carrigogunnell and there are voices of Norman girls from olden times laughing and singing in French and when I see them in my mind I'm tempted and I climb to the very top of the castle where once there was a tower and there in full view of Ireland I interfere with myself and spurt all over Carrigogunnell and fields beyond. That's a sin I could never tell a priest. Climbing to great heights and going at yourself before all of Ireland is surely worse than doing it in a private place with yourself or with another or with some class of a beast. Somewhere down there in the fields or along the banks of the Shannon a boy or a milkmaid might have looked up and seen me in my sin and if they did I'm doomed because the priests are always saying that anyone who exposes a child to sin will have a millstone tied around his neck and be cast into the sea. Still, the thought of someone watching me brings on the excitement again. I wouldn't want a small boy to be watching me. No, no, that would surely lead to the millstone, but if there was a milkmaid gawking up she'd surely get excited and go at herself though I don't know if girls can go at themselves when they don't have anything to go at. No equipment, as Mikey Molloy used to say. I wish that old deaf Dominican priest would come back so that I could tell him my troubles with the excitement but he's dead now and I'll have to face a priest who'll go on about the millstone and the doom. Doom. That's the favorite word of every priest in Limerick. I walk back along O'Connell Avenue and Ballinacurra where people have their bread and milk delivered early to their doorsteps and surely there's no harm if I borrow a loaf or a bottle with every intention of giving it back when I get my job at the post office. I'm not stealing, I'm borrowing, and that's not a mortal sin. Besides, I stood on top of a castle this morning and committed a sin far worse than stealing bread and milk and if you commit one sin you might as well commit a few more because you get the same sentence in hell. One sin, eternity. A dozen sins, eternity. Might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, as my mother would say. I drink the odd pint of milk and leave the bottle so that the milkman won't be blamed for not delivering. I like milkmen because one of them gave me two broken eggs which I swallowed raw with bits of shells and all. He said I'd grow up powerful if I had nothing else but two eggs in a pint of porter every day. Everything you need is in the egg and everything you want is in the pint. Some houses get better bread than others. It costs more and that's what I take. I feel sorry for the rich people who will get up in the morning and go to the door and find their bread missing but I can't let myself starve to death. If I starve I'll never have the strength for my telegram boy job at the post office, which means I'll have no money to put back all that bread and milk and no way of saving to go to America and if I can't go to America I might as well jump into the River Shannon. It's only a few weeks till I get my first wages in the post office and surely these rich people won't collapse with the hunger till then. They can always send the maid out for more. That's the difference between the poor and the rich. The poor can't send out for more because there's no money to send out for more and if there was they wouldn't have a maid to send. It's the maids I have to worry about. I have to be careful when I borrow the milk and the bread and they're at the front doors polishing knobs, knockers and letter boxes. If they see me they'll be running to the woman of the house, Oh, madam, madam, there's an urchin beyant that's makin' off with all the milk and bread. Beyant. Maids talk like that because they're all from the country, Mullingar heifers, says Paddy Clohessy's uncle, beef to the heels, and they wouldn't give you the steam of their piss. I bring home the bread and even if The Abbot is surprised he doesn't say, Where did you get it? because he was dropped on his head and that knocks the curiosity out of you. He just looks at me with his big eyes that are blue in the middle and yellow all around and slurps his tea from the great cracked mug his mother left behind. He tells me, That's me mug and don't be drinkin' your tay oush of ish. Oush of ish. That's the Limerick slum talk that always worried Dad. He said, I don't want my sons growing up in a Limerick lane saying, Oush of ish. It's common and low-class. Say out of it properly. And Mam said, I hope it keeps fine for you but you're not doing much to get us oush of ish. Out beyond Ballinacurra I climb orchard walls for apples. If there's a dog I move on because I don't have Paddy Clohessy's way of talking to them. Farmers come at me but they're always slow in their rubber boots and even if they jump on a bicycle to chase me I jump over walls where they can't take a bike. The Abbot knows where I got the apples. If you grow up in the lanes of Limerick you're bound to rob the odd orchard sooner or later. Even if you hate apples you have to rob orchards or your pals will say you're a sissy. I always offer The Abbot an apple but he won't eat it because of the scarcity of teeth in his head. He has five left and he won't risk leaving them in an apple. If I cut the apple into slices he still won't eat it because that's not the proper way to eat an apple. That's what he says and if I say, You slice bread before you eat it, don't you? he says, Apples is apples and bread is bread. That's how you talk when you're dropped on your head. Michael comes again with warm tea in a milk bottle and two cuts of fried bread. I tell him I don't need it anymore. Tell Mam I'm taking care of myself and I don't need her tea and fried bread, thank you very much. Michael is delighted when I give him an apple and I tell him come every second day and he can have more. That stops him from asking me to go back to Laman Griffin's and I'm glad it stops his tears. There's a market down in Irishtown where the farmers come on Saturdays with their vegetables, hens, eggs, butter. If I'm there early they'll give me a few pennies for helping unload their carts or motor cars. At the end of the day they'll give me vegetables they can't sell, anything crushed, bruised or rotten in parts. One farmer's wife always gives me cracked eggs and tells me, Fry them eggs tomorrow when you come back from Mass in a state of grace for if you ate them eggs with a sin on your sowl they'll stick in your gullet, so they will. She's a farmer's wife and that's how they talk. I'm not much better than a beggar now myself the way I stand at the doors of fish and chip shops when they're closing in hopes they might have burnt chips left over or bits of fish floating around in the grease. If they're in a hurry the shop owners will give me the chips and a sheet of paper for wrapping. The paper I like is the News of the World. It's banned in Ireland but people sneak it in from England for the shocking pictures of girls in swimming suits that are almost not there. Then there are stories of people committing all kinds of sins you wouldn't find in Limerick, getting divorces, committing adultery. Adultery. I still have to find out what that word means, look it up in the library. I'm sure it's worse than what the masters taught us, bad thoughts, bad words, bad deeds. I take my chips home and get into bed like The Abbot. If he has a few pints taken he sits up eating his chips from the Limerick Leader and singing ""The Road to Rasheen. "" I eat my chips. I lick the News of the World. I lick the stories about people doing shocking things. I lick the girls in their bathing suits and when there's nothing left to lick I look at the girls till The Abbot blows out the light and I'm committing a mortal sin under the blanket. I can go to the library any time with Mam's card or Laman Griffin's. I'll never be caught because Laman is too lazy to get out of bed on a Saturday and Mam will never go near a library with the shame of her clothes. Miss O'Riordan smiles. The Lives of the Saints are waiting for you, Frank. Volumes and volumes. Butler, O'Hanlon, Baring Gould. I've told the head librarian all about you and she's so pleased she's ready to give you your own grown-up card. Isn't that wonderful? Thanks, Miss O'Riordan. I'm reading all about St. Brigid, virgin, February first. She was so beautiful that men from all over Ireland panted to marry her and her father wanted her to marry someone important. She didn't want to marry anyone so she prayed to God for help and He caused her eye to melt in her head so that it dribbled down her cheek and left such a great welt the men of Ireland lost interest. Then there's St. Wilgefortis, virgin martyr, July twentieth. Her mother had nine children, all at the same time, four sets of twins and Wilgefortis the odd one, all winding up martyrs for the faith. Wilgefortis was beautiful and her father wanted to marry her off to the King of Sicily. Wilgefortis was desperate and God helped her by allowing a beard and a mustache to grow on her face, which made the King of Sicily think twice but sent her father into such a rage he had her crucified beard and all. St. Wilgefortis is the one you pray to if you're an Englishwoman with a troublesome husband. The priests never tell us about virgin martyrs like St. Agatha, February fifth. February is a powerful month for virgin martyrs. Sicilian pagans ordered Agatha to give up her faith in Jesus and like all the virgin martyrs she said, Nay. They tortured her, stretched her on the rack, tore her sides with iron hooks, burned her with blazing torches, and she said, Nay, I will not deny Our Lord. They crushed her breasts and cut them off but when they rolled her over hot coals it was more than she could bear so she expired, giving praise. Virgin martyrs always died singing hymns and giving praise not minding one bit if lions tore big chunks from their sides and gobbled them on the spot. How is it the priests never told us about St. Ursula and her eleven thousand maiden martyrs, October twenty-first? Her father wanted her to marry a pagan king but she said, I'll go away for awhile, three years, and think about it. So off she goes with her thousand noble ladies-in- waiting and their companions, ten thousand. They sailed around for awhile and traipsed through various countries till they stopped in Cologne where the chief of the Huns asked Ursula to marry him. Nay, she said, and the Huns killed her and the maidens with her. Why couldn't she say yes and save the lives of eleven thousand virgins? Why did virgin martyrs have to be so stubborn? I like St. Moling, an Irish bishop. He didn't live in a palace like the bishop of Limerick. He lived in a tree and when other saints visited him for dinner they would sit around on branches like birds having a grand time with their water and dry bread. He was walking along one day and a leper said, Hoy, St. Moling, where are you going? I'm going to Mass, says St. Moling. Well, I'd like to go to Mass too, so why don't you hoist me up on your back and carry me? St. Moling did but he no sooner had the leper up on his back than the leper started to complain. Your hair shirt, he said, is hard on my sores, take it off. St. Moling took off the shirt and off they went again. Then the leper says, I need to blow my nose. St. Moling says, I don't have any class of a handkerchief, use your hand. The leper says, I can't hold on to you and blow my nose at the same time. All right, says St. Moling, you can blow into my hand. That won't do, says the leper, I barely have a hand left with the leprosy and I can't hold on and blow into your hand. If you were a proper saint you'd twist around here and suck the stuff out of my head. St. Moling didn't want to suck the leper's snot but he did and offered it up and praised God for the privilege. I could understand my father sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head when he was a baby and desperate but I don't understand why God wanted St. Moling to go around sucking the snot out of lepers' heads. I don't understand God at all and even if I'd like to be a saint and have everyone adore me I'd never suck the snot of a leper. I'd like to be a saint but if that's what you have to do I think I'll stay the way I am. Still, I'm ready to spend my life in this library reading about virgins and virgin martyrs till I get into trouble with Miss O'Riordan over a book someone left on the table. The author is Lin Yütang. Anyone can tell this is a Chinese name and I'm curious to know what the Chinese talk about. It's a book of essays about love and the body and one of his words sends me to the dictionary. Turgid. He says, The male organ of copulation becomes turgid and is inserted into the receptive female orifice. Turgid. The dictionary says swollen and that's what I am, standing there looking at the dictionary because I know now what Mikey Molloy was talking about all along, that we're no different from the dogs that get stuck in each other in the streets and it's shocking to think of all the mothers and fathers doing the likes of this. My father lied to me for years about the Angel on the Seventh Step. Miss O'Riordan wants to know what word I'm looking for. She always looks worried when I'm at the dictionary so I tell her I'm looking for canonize or beatific or any class of a religious word. And what's this? she says. This is not the Lives of the Saints. She picks up Lin Yütang and starts reading the page where I left the book face down on the table. Mother o' God. Is this what you were reading? I saw this in your hand. Well, I-I-only wanted to see if the Chinese, if the Chinese, ah, had any saints. Oh, indeed, you did. This is disgraceful. Filth. No wonder the Chinese are the way they are. But what could you expect of slanty eyes and yellow skin and you, now that I look at you, have a bit of the slanty eye yourself. You are to leave this library at once. But I'm reading the Lives of the Saints. Out or I'll call the head librarian and she'll have the guards on you. Out. You should be running to the priest and confessing your sins. Out, and before you go hand me the library cards of your poor mother and Mr. Griffin. I have a good mind to write to your poor mother and I would if I thought it wouldn't destroy her entirely. Lin Yütang, indeed. Out. There's no use trying to talk to librarians when they're in that state. You could stand there for an hour telling them all you've read about Brigid and Wilgefortis and Agatha and Ursula and the maiden martyrs but all they think about is one word on one page of Lin Yütang. The People's Park is behind the library. It's a sunny day, the grass is dry, and I'm worn out begging for chips and putting up with librarians who get into a state over turgid and I'm looking at the clouds drifting above the monument and drifting off myself all turgid till I'm having a dream about virgin martyrs in bathing suits in the News of the World pelting Chinese writers with sheeps' bladders and I wake up in a state of excitement with something hot and sticky pumping out of me oh God my male organ of copulation sticking out a mile people in the park giving me curious looks and mothers telling their children come over here love come away from that fella someone should call the guards on him. The day before my fourteenth birthday I see myself in the glass in Grandma's sideboard. The way I look how can I ever start my job at the post office. Everything is torn, shirt, gansey, short pants, stockings, and my shoes are ready to fall off my feet entirely. Relics of oul' decency, my mother would call them. If my clothes are bad I'm worse. No matter how I drench my hair under the tap it sticks out in all directions. The best cure for standing up hair is spit, only it's hard to spit on your own head. You have to let go with a good one up in the air and duck to catch it on your poll. My eyes are red and oozing yellow, there are matching red and yellow pimples all over my face and my front teeth are so black with rot I'll never be able to smile in my life. I have no shoulders and I know the whole world admires shoulders. When a man dies in Limerick the women always say, Grand man he was, shoulders that big and wide he wouldn't come in the door for you, had to come in sideways. When I die they'll say, Poor little divil, died without a sign of a shoulder. I wish I had some sign of a shoulder so that people would know I was at least fourteen years of age. All the boys in Leamy's had shoulders except for Fintan Slattery and I don't want to be like him with no shoulders and knees worn away from prayer. If I had any money left I'd light a candle to St. Francis and ask him if there's any chance God could be persuaded to perform a miracle on my shoulders. Or if I had a stamp I could write to Joe Louis and say, Dear Joe, Is there any chance you could tell me where you got your powerful shoulders even though you were poor? I have to look decent for my job so I take off all my clothes and stand naked in the backyard washing them under the tap with a bar of carbolic soap. I hang them on Grandma's clothesline, shirt, gansey, pants, stockings, and pray to God it won't rain, pray they'll be dry for tomorrow, which is the start of my life. I can't go anywhere in my pelt so I stay in bed all day reading old newspapers, getting excited with the girls in the News of the World and thanking God for the drying sun. The Abbot comes home at five and makes tea downstairs and even though I'm hungry I know he'll grumble if I ask him for anything. He knows the one thing that worries me is he might go to Aunt Aggie and complain I'm staying in Grandma's house and sleeping in her bed and if Aunt Aggie hears that she'll come over and throw me into the street. He hides the bread when he's finished and I can never find it. You would think that one who was never dropped on his head would be able to find the hidden bread of one who was dropped on his head. Then I realize if the bread is not in the house he must take it with him in the pocket of the overcoat he wears winter and summer. The minute I hear him clumping from the kitchen to the backyard lavatory I run downstairs, pull the loaf from the pocket, cut off a thick slice, back into the pocket, up the stairs and into bed. He can never say a word, never accuse me. You'd have to be a thief of the worst class to steal one slice of bread and no one would ever believe him, not even Aunt Aggie. Besides, she'd bark at him and say, What are you doing anyway going around with a loaf of bread in your pocket? That's no place for a loaf of bread. I chew the bread slowly. One mouthful every fifteen minutes will make it last and if I wash it down with water the bread will swell in my belly and give me the full feeling. I look out the back window to make sure the evening sun is drying my clothes. Other backyards have lines with clothes that are bright and colorful and dance in the wind. Mine hang from the line like dead dogs. The sun is bright but it's cold and damp in the house and I wish I had something to wear in the bed. I have no other clothes and if I touch anything of The Abbot's he'll surely run to Aunt Aggie. All I can find in the wardrobe is Grandma's old black woolen dress. You're not supposed to wear your Grandmother's old dress when she's dead and you're a boy but what does it matter if it keeps you warm and you're in bed under the blankets where no one will ever know. The dress has the smell of old dead grandmother and I worry she might rise from the grave and curse me before the whole family and all assembled. I pray to St. Francis, ask him to keep her in the grave where she belongs, promise him a candle when I start my job, remind him the robe he wore himself wasn't too far from a dress and no one ever tormented him over it and fall asleep with the image of his face in my dream. The worst thing in the world is to be sleeping in your dead grandmother's bed wearing her black dress when your uncle The Abbot falls on his arse outside South's pub after a night of drinking pints and people who can't mind their own business rush to Aunt Aggie's house to tell her so that she gets Uncle Pa Keating to help her carry The Abbot home and upstairs to where you're sleeping and she barks at you, What are you doin' in this house, in that bed? Get up and put on the kettle for tea for your poor uncle Pat that fell down, and when you don't move she pulls the blankets and falls backward like one seeing a ghost and yelling Mother o' God what are you doin' in me dead mother's dress? That's the worst thing of all because it's hard to explain that you're getting ready for the big job in your life, that you washed your clothes, they're drying abroad on the line, and it was so cold you had to wear the only thing you could find in the house, and it's even harder to talk to Aunt Aggie when The Abbot is groaning in the bed, Me feet is like a fire, put water on me feet, and Uncle Pa Keating is covering his mouth with his hand and collapsing against the wall laughing and telling you that you look gorgeous and black suits you and would you ever straighten your hem. You don't know what to do when Aunt Aggie tells you, Get out of that bed and put the kettle on downstairs for tea for your poor uncle. Should you take off the dress and put on a blanket or should you go as you are? One minute she's screaming, What are you doin' in me poor mother's dress? the next she's telling you put on that bloody kettle. I tell her I washed my clothes for the big job. What big job? Telegram boy at the post office. She says if the post office is hiring the likes of you they must be in a desperate way altogether, go down and put on that kettle. The next worse thing is to be out in the backyard filling the kettle from the tap with the moon beaming away and Kathleen Purcell from next door perched up on the wall looking for her cat. God, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' in your grandmother's dress? and you have to stand there in the dress with the kettle in your hand and explain how you washed your clothes which are hanging there on the line for all to see and you were so cold in the bed you put on your grandmother's dress and your uncle Pat, The Abbot, fell down and was brought home by Aunt Aggie and her husband, Pa Keating, and she drove you into the backyard to fill this kettle and you'll take off this dress as soon as ever your clothes are dry because you never had any desire to go through life in your dead grandmother's dress. Now Kathleen Purcell lets out a scream, falls off the wall, forgets the cat, and you can hear her giggling into her blind mother, Mammy, Mammy, wait till I tell you about Frankie McCourt abroad in the backyard in his dead grandmother's dress. You know that once Kathleen Purcell gets a bit of scandal the whole lane will know it before morning and you might as well stick your head out the window and make a general announcement about yourself and the dress problem. By the time the kettle boils The Abbot is asleep from the drink and Aunt Aggie says she and Uncle Pa will have a drop of tea themselves and she doesn't mind if I have a drop myself. Uncle Pa says on second thought the black dress could be the cassock of a Dominican priest and he goes down on his knees and says, Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Aunt Aggie says, Get up, you oul' eejit, and stop makin' a feck of religion. Then she says, And you what are you doin' in this house? I can't tell her about Mam and Laman Griffin and the excitement in the loft. I tell her I was thinking of staying here a while because of the great distance from Laman Griffin's house to the post office and as soon as I get on my feet we'll surely find a decent place and we'll all move on, my mother and brothers and all. Well, she says, that's more than your father would do. XV It's hard to sleep when you know the next day you're fourteen and starting your first job as a man. The Abbot wakes at dawn moaning. Would I ever make him some tay and if I do I can have a big cut of bread from the half loaf in his pocket which he was keeping there out of the way of the odd rat and if I look in Grandma's gramophone where she used to keep the records I'll find a jar of jam. He can't read, he can't write, but he knows where to hide the jam. I bring The Abbot his tea and bread and make some for myself. I put on my damp clothes and get into the bed hoping that if I stay there the clothes will dry from my own heat before I go to work. Mam always says it's the damp clothes that give you the consumption and an early grave. The Abbot is sitting up telling me he has a terrible pain in his head from a dream where I was wearing his poor mother's black dress and she flying around screaming, Sin, sin, 'tis a sin. He finishes his tea and falls into a snore sleep and I wait for his clock to say half-past eight, time to get up and be at the post office at nine even if the clothes are still damp on my skin. On my way out I wonder why Aunt Aggie is coming down the lane. She must be coming to see if The Abbot is dead or needing a doctor. She says, What time do you have to be at that job? Nine. All right. She turns and walks with me to the post office on Henry Street. She doesn't say a word and I wonder if she's going to the post office to denounce me for sleeping in my grandmother's bed and wearing her black dress. She says, Go up and tell them your aunt is down here waiting for you and you'll be an hour late. If they want to argue I'll go up and argue. Why do I have to be an hour late? Do what you're bloody well told. There are telegram boys sitting on a bench along a wall. There are two women at a desk, one fat, one thin. The thin one says, Yes? My name is Frank McCourt, miss, and I'm here to start work. What kind of work would that be now? Telegram boy, miss. The thin one cackles, Oh, God, I thought you were here to clean the lavatories. No, miss. My mother brought a note from the priest, Dr. Cowpar, and there's supposed to be a job. Oh, there is, is there? And do you know what day this is? I do, miss. 'Tis my birthday. I'm fourteen. Isn't that grand, says the fat woman. Today is Thursday, says the thin woman. Your job starts on Monday. Go away and wash yourself and come back then. The telegram boys along the wall are laughing. I don't know why but I feel my face turning hot. I tell the women, Thank you, and on the way out I hear the thin one, Jesus above, Maureen, who dragged in that specimen? and they laugh along with the telegram boys. Aunt Aggie says, Well? and I tell her I don't start till Monday. She says my clothes are a disgrace and what did I wash them in. Carbolic soap. They smell like dead pigeons and you're making a laughingstock of the whole family. She takes me to Roche's Stores and buys me a shirt, a gansey, a pair of short pants, two pairs of stockings and a pair of summer shoes on sale. She gives me two shillings to have tea and a bun for my birthday. She gets on the bus to go back up O'Connell Street too fat and lazy to walk. Fat and lazy, no son of her own, and still she buys me the clothes for my new job. I turn toward Arthur's Quay with the package of new clothes under my arm and I have to stand at the edge of the River Shannon so that the whole world won't see the tears of a man the day he's fourteen. Monday morning I'm up early to wash my face and flatten my hair with water and spit. The Abbot sees me in my new clothes. Jaysus, he says, is it gettin' married you are? and goes back to sleep. Mrs. O'Connell, the fat woman, says, Well, well, aren't we the height of fashion, and the thin one, Miss Barry, says, Did you rob a bank on the weekend? and there's a great laugh from the telegram boys sitting on the bench along the wall. I'm told to sit at the end of the bench and wait for my turn to go out with telegrams. Some telegram boys in uniforms are the permanent ones who took the exam. They can stay in the post office forever if they like, take the next exam for postman and then the one for clerk that lets them work inside selling stamps and money orders behind the counter downstairs. The post office gives permanent boys big waterproof capes for the bad weather and they get two weeks holiday every year. Everyone says these are good jobs, steady and pensionable and respectable, and if you get a job like this you never have to worry again in your whole life, so you don't. Temporary telegram boys are not allowed to stay in the job beyond the age of sixteen. There are no uniforms, no holidays, the pay is less, and if you stay out sick a day you can be fired. No excuses. There are no waterproof capes. Bring your own raincoat or dodge the raindrops. Mrs. O'Connell calls me to her desk to give me a black leather belt and pouch. She says there's a great shortage of bicycles so I'll have to walk my first batch of telegrams. I'm to go to the farthest address first, work my way back, and don't take all day. She's long enough in the post office to know how long it takes to deliver six telegrams even by foot. I'm not to be stopping in pubs or bookies or even home for a cup of tea and if I do I'll be found out. I'm not to be stopping in chapels to say a prayer. If I have to pray do it on the hoof or on the bicycle. If it rains pay no attention. Deliver the telegrams and don't be a sissy. One telegram is addressed to Mrs. Clohessy of Arthur's Quay and that couldn't be anyone but Paddy's mother. Is that you, Frankie McCourt? she says. God, I wouldn't know you you're that big. Come in, will you. She's wearing a bright frock with flowers all over and shiny new shoes. There are two children on the floor playing with a toy train. On the table there is a teapot, cups with saucers, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, butter, jam. There are two beds over by the window where there were none before. The big bed in the corner is empty and she must know what I'm wondering. He's gone, she says, but he's not dead. Gone t' England with Paddy. Have a cup o' tay an' a bit o' bread. You need it, God help us. You look like one left over from the Famine itself. Ate that bread an' jam an' build yourself up. Paddy always talked about you and Dennis, my poor husband that was in the bed, never got over the day your mother came an' sang the song about the Kerry dancing. He's over in England now making sandwiches in a canteen and sending me a few bob every week. You'd wonder what the English are thinking about when they take a man that has the consumption and give him a job making sandwiches. Paddy has a grand job in a pub in Cricklewood, which is in England. Dennis would still be here if it wasn't for Paddy climbin' the wall for the tongue. Tongue? Dennis had the craving, so he did, for a nice sheep's head with a bit of cabbage and a spud so up with me to Barry the butcher with the last few shillings I had. I boiled that head an' sick an' all as he was Dennis couldn't wait for it to be done. He was a demon there in the bed callin' for the head an' when I gave it to him on the plate he was delighted with himself suckin' the marrow outa every inch of that head. Then he finishes an' he says, Mary, where is the tongue? What tongue? says I. The tongue of this sheep. Every sheep is born with a tongue that lets him go ba ba ba and there's a great lack of tongue in this head. Go up to Barry the butcher and demand it. So up with me to Barry the butcher and he said, That bloody sheep came in here bleatin'an'cryin'so much we cut the tongue from her and thrun it to the dog who gobbled it up and ever since ba bas like a sheep and if he doesn't quit I'll cut his tongue and throw it to the cat. Back I go to Dennis and he gets frantic in the bed. I want that tongue, he says. All the nourishment is in the tongue. And what do you think happens next but my Paddy, that was your friend, goes up to Barry the butcher after dark, climbs the wall, cuts the tongue of a sheep's head that's on a hook on the wall and brings it back to his poor father in the bed. Of course I have to boil that tongue with salt galore and Dennis, God love him, ates it, lies back in the bed a minute, throws back the blanket and stands out on his two feet announcing to the world that consumption or no consumption, he's not going to die in that bed, if he's going to die at all it might as well be under a German bomb with him making a few pounds for his family instead of whining in the bed there beyond. She shows me a letter from Paddy. He's working in his uncle Anthony's pub twelve hours a day, twenty-five shillings a week and every day soup and a sandwich. He's delighted when the Germans come over with the bombs so that he can sleep while the pub is closed. At night he sleeps on the floor of the hallway upstairs. He will send his mother two pounds every month and he's saving the rest to bring her and the family to England where they'll be much better off in one room in Cricklewood than ten rooms in Arthur's Quay. She'll be able to get a job no bother. You'd have to be a sad case not to be able to get a job in a country that's at war especially with Yanks pouring in and spending money right and left. Paddy himself is planning to get a job in the middle of London where Yanks leave tips big enough to feed an Irish family of six for a week. Mrs. Clohessy says, We have enough money for food and shoes at last, thanks be to God and His Blessed Mother. You'll never guess who Paddy met over there in England fourteen years of age an' workin' like a man. Brendan Kiely, the one ye used to call Question. Workin' he is an' savin' so he can go an' join the Mounties an' ride all over Canada like Nelson Eddy singin' I'll be callin' you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. If it wasn't for Hitler we'd all be dead an' isn't that a terrible thing to say. And how's your poor mother, Frankie? She's grand, Mrs. Clohessy. No, she's not. I seen her in the Dispensary and she looks worse than my Dennis did in the bed. You have to mind your poor mother. You look desperate too, Frankie, with them two red eyes starin' outa your head. Here's a little tip for you. Thruppence. Buy yourself a sweet. I will, Mrs. Clohessy. Do. *** At the end of the week Mrs. O'Connell hands me the first wages of my life, a pound, my first pound. I run down the stairs and up to O'Connell Street, the main street, where the lights are on and people are going home from work, people like me with wages in their pockets. I want them to know I'm like them, I'm a man, I have a pound. I walk up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and hope they'll notice me. They don't. I want to wave my pound note at the world so they'll say, There he goes, Frankie McCourt the workingman, with a pound in his pocket. It's Friday night and I can do anything I like. I can have fish and chips and go to the Lyric Cinema. No, no more Lyric. I don't have to sit up in the gods anymore with people all around me cheering on the Indians killing General Custer and the Africans chasing Tarzan all over the jungle. I can go to the Savoy Cinema now, pay sixpence for a seat down front where there's a better class of people eating boxes of chocolates and covering their mouths when they laugh. After the film I can have tea and buns in the restaurant upstairs. Michael is across the street calling me. He's hungry and wonders if there's any chance he could go to The Abbot's for a bit of bread and stay there for the night instead of going all the way to Laman Griffin's. I tell him he doesn't have to worry about a bit of bread. We'll go to the Coliseum Café and have fish and chips, all he wants, lemonade galore, and then we'll go to see Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney and eat two big bars of chocolate. After the film we have tea and buns and we sing and dance like Cagney all the way to The Abbot's. Michael says it must be great to be in America where people have nothing else to do but sing and dance. He's half asleep but he says he's going there some day to sing and dance and would I help him go and when he's asleep I start thinking about America and how I have to save money for my fare instead of squandering it on fish and chips and tea and buns. I'll have to save a few shillings from my pound because if I don't I'll be in Limerick forever. I'm fourteen now and if I save something every week surely I should be able to go to America by the time I'm twenty. There are telegrams for offices, shops, factories where there's no hope of a tip. Clerks take the telegrams without a look at you or a thank you. There are telegrams for the respectable people with maids along the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road where there's no hope of a tip. Maids are like clerks, they don't look at you or say thank you. There are telegrams for the houses of priests and nuns and they have maids, too, even if they say poverty is noble. If you waited for tips from priests or nuns you'd die on their doorstep. There are telegrams for people miles outside the city, farmers with muddy yards and dogs who want to eat your legs. There are telegrams for rich people in big houses with gate lodges and miles of land surrounded by walls. The gatekeeper waves you in and you have to cycle for miles up long drives past lawns, flower beds, fountains to reach the big house. If the weather is fine people are playing croquet, the Protestant game, or strolling around, talking and laughing, all decked out in flowery dresses and blazers with crests and golden buttons and you'd never know there was a war on. There are Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked outside the great front door where a maid tells you go around to the servants' entrance don't you know any better. People in the big houses have English accents and they don't tip telegram boys. The best people for tips are widows, Protestant ministers' wives and the poor in general. Widows know when the telegram money order is due from the English government and they wait by the window. You have to be careful if they ask you in for a cup of tea because one of the temporary boys, Scrawby Luby, said an old widow of thirty-five had him in for tea and tried to take down his pants and he had to run out of the house though he was really tempted and had to go to confession the next Saturday. He said it was very awkward hopping up on the bike with his thing sticking out but if you cycle very fast and think of the sufferings of the Virgin Mary you'll go soft in no time. Protestant ministers' wives would never carry on like Scrawby Luby's old widow unless they're widows themselves. Christy Wallace, who is a permanent telegram boy and ready to be a postman any day, says Protestants don't care what they do even if they're ministers' wives. They're doomed anyway, so what does it matter if they have a bit of a romp with a telegram boy. All the telegram boys like Protestant ministers' wives. They might have maids but they answer doors themselves and say, One moment, please, and give you sixpence. I'd like to talk to them and ask them how it feels to be doomed but they might get offended and take back the sixpence. The Irishmen working in England send their telegram money orders on Friday nights and all day Saturday and that's when we get the good tips. The minute we deliver one batch we're out with another. The worst lanes are in the Irishtown, off High Street or Mungret Street, worse than Roden Lane or O'Keeffe's Lane or any lane I lived in. There are lanes with channels running down the middle. Mothers stand at doors and yell gardyloo when they empty their slop buckets. Children make paper boats or float matchboxes with little sails on the greasy water. When you ride into a lane the children call out, Here's the telegram boy, here's the telegram boy. They run to you and the women wait at the door. If you give a small child a telegram for his mother he's the hero of the family. Little girls know they're supposed to wait till the boys get their chance though they can get the telegram if they have no brothers. Women at the door will call to you that they have no money now but if you're in this lane tomorrow knock on the door for your tip, God bless you an' all belongin' to you. Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry at the post office tell us every day our job is to deliver telegrams and nothing else. We are not to be doing things for people, going to the shop for groceries or any other kind of message. They don't care if people are dying in the bed. They don't care if people are legless, lunatic or crawling on the floor. We are to deliver the telegram and that's all. Mrs. O'Connell says, I know everything ye do, everything, for the people of Limerick have their eye on ye and there are reports which I have here in my drawers. A fine place to keep reports, says Toby Mackey under his breath. But Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry don't know what it's like in the lane when you knock on a door and someone says come in and you go in and there's no light and there's a pile of rags on a bed in a corner the pile saying who is it and you say telegram and the pile of rags tells you would you ever go to the shop for me I'm starving with the hunger and I'd give me two eyes for a cup of tea and what are you going to do say I'm busy and ride off on your bike and leave the pile of rags there with a telegram money order that's pure useless because the pile of rags is helpless to get out of the bed to go to the post office to cash the bloody money order. What are you supposed to do? You're told never never go to the post office to cash one of those money orders for anyone or you'll lose your job forever. But what are you supposed to do when an old man that was in the Boer War hundreds of years ago says his legs are gone and he'd be forever grateful if you'd go to Paddy Considine in the post office and tell him the situation and Paddy will surely cash the money order and keep two shillings for yourself grand boy that you are. Paddy Considine says no bother but don't tell anyone or I'd be out on my arse and so would you, son. The old man from the Boer War says he knows you have telegrams to deliver now but would you ever come back tonight and maybe go to the shop for him for he doesn't have a thing in the house and he's freezing on top of it. He sits in an old armchair in the corner covered with bits of blankets and a bucket behind the chair that stinks enough to make you sick and when you look at that old man in the dark corner you want to get a hose with hot water and strip him and wash him down and give him a big feed of rashers and eggs and mashed potatoes with loads of butter salt and onions. I want to take the man from the Boer War and the pile of rags in the bed and put them in a big sunny house in the country with birds chirping away outside the window and a stream gurgling. Mrs. Spillane in Pump Lane off Carey's Road has two crippled twin children with big blond heads, small bodies, and bits of legs that dangle over the edges of the chairs. They look into the fire all day and say, Where's Daddy? They speak English like everybody else but they babble away to one another in a language they made up, Hung sup tea tea sup hung. Mrs. Spillane says that means, When are we getting our supper? She tells me she's lucky if her husband sends four pounds a month and she's beside herself with the abuse she gets from the Dispensary over him being in England. The children are only four and they're very bright even if they can't walk or take care of themselves. If they could walk, if they were any way normal, she'd pack up and move to England out of this godforsaken country that fought so long for freedom and look at the state of us, De Valera in his mansion above in Dublin the dirty oul' bastard and the rest of the politicians that can all go to hell, God forgive me. The priests can go to hell too and I won't ask God to forgive me for saying the likes of that. There they are, the priests and the nuns telling us Jesus was poor and 'tis no shame, lorries driving up to their houses with crates and barrels of whiskey and wine, eggs galore and legs of ham and they telling us what we should give up for Lent. Lent, my arse. What are we to give up when we have Lent all year long? I want to take Mrs. Spillane and her two blond crippled children and put them in that house in the country with the pile of rags and the man from the Boer War and wash everyone and let them all sit in the sun with the birds singing and the streams gurgling. I can't leave the pile of rags alone with a useless money order because the pile is an old woman, Mrs. Gertrude Daly, all twisted with every class of disease you can get in a Limerick lane, arthritis, rheumatism, falling hair, a nostril half gone from her jabbing at it with her finger, and you wonder what kind of a world is it when this old woman sits up from the rags and smiles at you with teeth that gleam white in the dark, her own teeth and perfect. That's right, she says, me own teeth, and when I rot in the grave they'll find me teeth a hundred years from now all white an' shiny an' I'll be declared a saint. The telegram money order, three pounds, is from her son. It has a message, Happy Birthday, Mammy, Your fond son, Teddy. She says, A wonder he can spare it, the little shit, trottin' around with every tart in Piccadilly. She asks if I'd ever do her a favor and cash the money order and get her a little Baby Powers whiskey at the pub, a loaf of bread, a pound of lard, seven potatoes, one for each day of the week. Would I boil a potato for bread, bring O'Connor the some soap so grateful and my troubles. her, mash it up with a lump of lard, give her a cut of her a drop of water to go with the whiskey? Would I go to chemist for ointment for her sores and while I'm at it bring she can give her body a good scrub and she'll be forever say a prayer for me and here's a couple of shillings for all Ah, no thanks, ma'am. Take the money. Little tip. You did me great favors. I couldn't, ma'am, the way you are. Take the money or I'll tell the post office you're not to deliver my telegram anymore. Oh, all right, ma'am. Thanks very much. Good night, son. Be good to your mother. Good night, Mrs. Daly. School starts in September and some days Michael stops at The Abbot's before the walk home to Laman Griffin's. On rainy days he says, Can I stay here tonight? and soon he doesn't want to go back to Laman Griffin's at all. He's worn out and hungry with two miles out and two miles back. When Mam comes looking for him I don't know what to say to her. I don't know how to look at her and I keep my eyes off to one side. She says, How's the job? as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's and I say, Grand, as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's. If the rain is too heavy for her to go home she stays in the small room upstairs with Alphie. She goes back to Laman's the next day but Michael stays and soon she's moving in herself bit by bit till she stops going to Laman's altogether. The Abbot pays the rent every week. Mam gets the relief and the food dockets till someone informs on her and she's cut off from the Dispensary. She's told that if her son is bringing in a pound a week that's more than some families get on the dole and she should be grateful he has a job. Now I have to hand over my wages. Mam says, A pound? Is that all you get for riding around in all kinds of weather? This would be four dollars in America. Four dollars. And you couldn't feed a cat for four dollars in New York. If you were delivering telegrams for Western Union in New York you'd be earning twenty-five dollars a week and living in luxury. She always translates Irish money into American so that she won't forget and tries to convince everyone times were better over there. Some weeks she lets me keep two shillings but if I go to a film or buy a secondhand book there's nothing left, I won't be able to save for my fare, and I'll be stuck in Limerick till I'm an old man of twenty-five. Malachy writes from Dublin to say he's fed up and doesn't want to spend the rest of his life blowing a trumpet in the army band. He's home in a week and complains when he has to share the big bed with Michael, Alphie and me. He had his own army cot up there in Dublin with sheets and blankets and a pillow. Now he's back to overcoats and a bolster that sends up a cloud of feathers when you touch it. Mam says, Pity about you. I'm sorry for your troubles. The Abbot has his own bed, and my mother has the small room. We're all together again, no Laman tormenting us. We make tea and fried bread and sit on the kitchen floor. The Abbot says you're not supposed to be sitting on kitchen floors, what are tables and chairs for? He tells Mam that Frankie is not right in the head and Mam says we'll all catch our death from the damp of the floor. We sit on the floor and sing and Mam and The Abbot sit on chairs. She sings ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" and the Abbot sings ""The Road to Rasheen"" and we still don't know what his song is about. We sit on the floor and tell stories about things that happened, things that never happened and things that will happen when we all go to America. There are slow days at the post office and we sit on the bench and talk. We can talk but we are not to laugh. Miss Barry says we should be grateful we're getting paid to sit there, bunch of idlers and streetboys that we are, and that there is to be no laughing. Getting paid for sitting and chatting is no laughing matter and the first titter out of any of us and out we go till we come to our senses and if the tittering continues we'll be reported to the proper authorities. The boys talk about her under their breath. Toby Mackey says, What that oul' bitch needs is a good rub o' the relic, a good rub o' the brush. Her mother was a streetwalking flaghopper and her father escaped from a lunatic asylum with bunions on his balls and warts on his wank. There is laughing along the bench and Miss Barry calls to us, I warned ye against the laughing. Mackey, what is it you're prattling about over there? I said we'd all be better off out in the fresh air on this fine day delivering telegrams, Miss Barry. I'm sure you did, Mackey. Your mouth is a lavatory. Did you hear me? I did, Miss Barry. You have been heard on the stairs, Mackey. Yes, Miss Barry. Shut up, Mackey. I will, Miss Barry. Not another word, Mackey. No, Miss Barry. I said shut up, Mackey. All right, Miss Barry. That's the end of it, Mackey. Don't try me. I won't, Miss Barry. Mother o' God give me patience. Yes, Miss Barry. Take the last word, Mackey. Take it, take it, take it. I will, Miss Barry. Toby Mackey is a temporary telegram boy like me. He saw a film called The Front Page and now he wants to go to America some day and be a tough newspaper reporter with a hat and a cigarette. He keeps a notebook in his pocket because a good reporter has to write down what happens. Facts. He has to write down facts not a lot of bloody poetry, which is all you hear in Limerick with men in pubs going on about our great sufferings under the English. Facts, Frankie. He writes down the number of telegrams he delivers and how far he travels. We sit on the bench making sure we don't laugh and he tells me that if we deliver forty telegrams a day that's two hundred a week and that's ten thousand a year and twenty thousand in our two years at the job. If we cycle one hundred and twenty-five miles in a week that's thirteen thousand miles in two years and that's halfway around the world, Frankie, and no wonder there isn't a scrap of flesh on our arses. Toby says nobody knows Limerick like the telegram boy. We know every avenue, road, street, terrace, mews, place, close, lane. Jasus, says Toby, there isn't a door in Limerick we don't know. We knock on all kinds of doors, iron, oak, plywood. Twenty thousand doors, Frankie. We rap, kick, push. We ring and buzz bells. We shout and whistle, Telegram boy, telegram boy. We drop telegrams in letter boxes, shove them under doors, throw them over the transom. We climb in windows where people are bedridden. We fight off every dog who wants to turn us into dinner. You never know what's going to happen when you hand people their telegrams. They laugh and sing and dance and cry and scream and fall down in a weakness and you wonder if they'll wake up at all and give you the tip. It's not a bit like delivering telegrams in America where Mickey Rooney rides around in a film called The Human Comedy and people are pleasant and falling over themselves to give you a tip, inviting you in, giving you a cup of tea and a bun. Toby Mackey says he has facts galore in his notebook and he doesn't give a fiddler's fart about anything and that's the way I'd like to be myself. Mrs. O'Connell knows I like the country telegrams and if a day is sunny she gives me a batch of ten that will keep me away all morning and I don't have to return till after the dinner hour at noon. There are fine autumn days when the Shannon sparkles and the fields are green and glinting with silver morning dew. Smoke blows across fields and there's the sweet smell of turf fires. Cows and sheep graze in the fields and I wonder if these are the beasts the priest was talking about. I wouldn't be surprised because there's no end to the bulls climbing on cows, rams on sheep, stallions on mares, and they all have such big things it makes me break out in a sweat to look at them and I feel sorry for all the female creatures in the world who have to suffer like that though I wouldn't mind being a bull myself because they can do what they like and it's never a sin for an animal. I wouldn't mind going at myself here but you never know when a farmer might come along the road driving cows and sheep to a fair or to another field raising his stick and bidding you, Good day, young fella, grand morning, thank God and His Blessed Mother. A farmer that religious might be offended if he saw you breaking the Sixth Commandment forninst his field. Horses like to stick their heads over fences and hedges to see what's passing by and I stop and talk to them because they have big eyes and long noses that show how intelligent they are. Sometimes two birds will be singing to each other across a field and I have to stop and listen to them and if I stay long enough more birds will join till every tree and bush is alive with birdsong. If there's a stream gurgling under a bridge on the road, birds singing and cows mooing and lambs baaing, that's better than any band in a film. The smell of dinner bacon and cabbage wafting from a farmhouse makes me so weak with the hunger I climb into a field and stuff myself with blackberries for half an hour. I stick my face into the stream and drink icy water that's better than the lemonade in any fish and chip shop. When I'm finished delivering the telegrams there's enough time to go to the ancient monastery graveyard where my mother's relations are buried, the Guilfoyles and the Sheehans, where my mother wants to be buried. I can see from here the high ruins of Carrigogunnell Castle and there's plenty of time to cycle there, sit up on the highest wall, look at the Shannon flowing out to the Atlantic on its way to America and dream of the day I'll be sailing off myself. The boys at the post office tell me I'm lucky to get the Carmody family telegram, a shilling tip, one of the biggest tips you'll ever get in Limerick. So why am I getting it? I'm the junior boy. They say, Well, sometimes Theresa Carmody answers the door. She has the consumption and they're afraid of catching it from her. She's seventeen, in and out of the sanatorium, and she'll never see eighteen. The boys at the post office say sick people like Theresa know there's little time left and that makes them mad for love and romance and everything. Everything. That's what the consumption does to you, say the boys at the post office. I cycle through wet November streets thinking of that shilling tip, and as I turn into the Carmody street the bicycle slides out from under me and I skid along the ground scraping my face and tearing open the back of my hand. Theresa Carmody opens the door. She has red hair. She had green eyes like the fields beyond Limerick. Her cheeks are bright pink and her skin is a fierce white. She says, Oh, you're all wet and bleeding. I skidded on my bike. Come in and I'll put something on your cuts. I wonder, Should I go in? I might get the consumption and that will be the end of me. I want to be alive when I'm fifteen and I want the shilling tip. Come in. You'll perish standing there. She puts on the kettle for the tea. Then she dabs iodine on my cuts and I try to be a man and not whimper. She says, Oh, you're a great bit of a man. Go into the parlor and dry yourself before the fire. Look, why don't you take off your pants and dry them on the screen of the fire? Ah, no. Ah, do. I will. I drape my pants over the screen. I sit there watching the steam rise and I watch myself rise and I worry she might come in and see me in my excitement. There she is with a plate of bread and jam and two cups of tea. Lord, she says, you might be a scrawny bit of a fellow but that's a fine boyo you have there. She puts the plate and the cups on a table by the fire and there they stay. With her thumb and forefinger she takes the tip of my excitement and leads me across the room to a green sofa against the wall and all the time my head is filled with sin and iodine and fear of consumption and the shilling tip and her green eyes and she's on the sofa don't stop or I'll die and she's crying and I'm crying for I don't know what's happening to me if I'm killing myself catching consumption from her mouth I'm riding to heaven I'm falling off a cliff and if this is a sin I don't give a fiddler's fart. We take our ease on the sofa a while till she says, Don't you have more telegrams to deliver? and when we sit up she gives a little cry, Oh, I'm bleeding. What's up with you? I think it's because it's the first time. I tell her, Wait a minute. I bring the bottle from the kitchen and splash the iodine on her injury. She leaps from the sofa, dances around the parlor like a wild one and runs into the kitchen to douse herself with water. After she dries herself she says, Lord, you're very innocent. You're not supposed to be pouring iodine on girls like that. I thought you were cut. For weeks after that I deliver the telegram. Sometimes we have the excitement on the sofa but there are other days she has the cough and you can see the weakness on her. She never tells me she has the weakness. She never tells me she has the consumption. The boys at the post office say I must have been having a great time with the shilling tip and Theresa Carmody. I never tell them I stopped taking the shilling tip. I never tell them about the green sofa and the excitement. I never tell them of the pain that comes when she opens the door and I can see the weakness on her and all I want to do then is make tea for her and sit with my arms around her on the green sofa. One Saturday I'm told to deliver the telegram to Theresa's mother at her job in Woolworth's. I try to be casual. Mrs. Carmody, I always deliver the telegram to your, I think your daughter, Theresa? Yes, she's in the hospital. Is she in the sanatorium? I said she's in the hospital. She's like everyone else in Limerick, ashamed of the TB, and she doesn't give me a shilling or any kind of tip. I cycle out to the sanatorium to see Theresa. They say you have to be a relation and you have to be adult. I tell them I'm her cousin and I'll be fifteen in August. They tell me go away. I cycle to the Franciscan church to pray for Theresa. St. Francis, would you please talk to God. Tell Him it wasn't Theresa's fault. I could have refused that telegram Saturday after Saturday. Tell God Theresa was not responsible for the excitement on the sofa because that's what the consumption does to you. It doesn't matter anyway, St. Francis, because I love Theresa. I love her as much as you love any bird or beast or fish and will you tell God take the consumption away and I promise I'll never go near her again. The next Saturday they give me the Carmody telegram. From halfway up the street I can see the blinds are drawn. I can see the black crepe wreath on the door. I can see the white purple-lined mourning card. I can see beyond the door and walls where Theresa and I tumbled naked and wild on the green sofa and I know now she is in hell and all because of me. I slip the telegram under the door and cycle back down to the Franciscan church to beg for the repose of Theresa's soul. I pray to every statue, to the stained glass windows, the Stations of the Cross. I swear I'll lead a life of faith, hope and charity, poverty, chastity and obedience. Next day, Sunday, I go to four Masses. I do the Stations of the Cross three times. I say rosaries all day. I go without food and drink and wherever I find a quiet place I cry and beg God and the Virgin Mary to have mercy on the soul of Theresa Carmody. On Monday I follow the funeral to the graveyard on my post office bicycle. I stand behind a tree a distance from the grave. Mrs. Carmody weeps and moans. Mr. Carmody snuffles and looks puzzled. The priest recites the Latin prayers and sprinkles the coffin with holy water. I want to go to the priest, to Mr. and Mrs. Carmody. I want to tell them how I'm the one who sent Theresa to hell. They can do whatever they like with me. Abuse me. Revile me. Throw grave dirt at me. But I stay behind the tree till the mourners leave and the grave diggers fill in the grave. Frost is already whitening the fresh earth on the grave and I think of Theresa cold in the coffin, the red hair, the green eyes. I can't understand the feelings going through me but I know that with all the people who died in my family and all the people who died in the lanes around me and all the people who left I never had a pain like this in my heart and I hope I never will again. It's getting dark. I walk my bicycle out of the graveyard. I have telegrams to deliver. XVI Mrs. O'Connell gives me telegrams to deliver to Mr. Harrington, the Englishman with the dead wife that was born and bred in Limerick. The boys at the post office say sympathy telegrams are a waste of time. People just cry and moan with the grief and they think they're excused from the tip. They'll ask you if you'd like to come in for a look at the departed and a prayer by the bed. That wouldn't be so bad if they offered you a drop of sherry and a ham sandwich. Oh, no, they're happy to get your prayer but you're only a telegram boy and you're lucky if you get a dry biscuit. Older boys at the post office say you have to play your cards right to get the grief tip. If you're asked in to say a prayer you have to kneel by the corpse, give a powerful sigh, bless yourself, drop your forehead to the bedclothes so they won't see your face, let your shoulders shake like one collapsing with sorrow, hold on to the bed with your two hands as if they're going to have to tear you away to deliver the rest of your telegrams, make sure your cheeks are glinting with tears or the spit you dabbed on, and if you don't get a tip after all that push the next batch of telegrams under the door or fire them over the transom and leave them to their grief. This isn't my first time delivering telegrams to the Harrington house. Mr. Harrington is always away on business for the insurance company and Mrs. Harrington is generous with the tip. But she's gone and Mr. Harrington answers the doorbell. His eyes are red and he sniffles. He says, Are you Irish? Irish? What else would I be standing there on his doorstep in Limerick with a batch of telegrams in my hand? I am, sir. He says, Come in. Put the telegrams on the hall stand. He shuts the hall door, locks it, puts the key in his pocket and I think, Aren't Englishmen very peculiar. You'll want to see her, of course. You'll want to see what you people have done to her with your damn tuberculosis. Race of ghouls. Follow me. He leads me first to the kitchen where he picks up a plate of ham sandwiches and two bottles, and then upstairs. Mrs. Harrington looks lovely in the bed, blond, pink, peaceful. This is my wife. She may be Irish but she doesn't look it, thank God. Like you. Irish. You'll need a drink, of course. You Irish quaff at every turn. Barely weaned before you clamor for the whiskey bottle, the pint of stout. You'll have what, whiskey, sherry? Ah, a lemonade will be lovely. I am mourning my wife not celebrating the bloody citrus. You'll have a sherry. Swill from bloody Catholic fascist Spain. I gulp the sherry. He refills my glass and goes to refill his own with whiskey. Damn. Whiskey all gone. Stay here. Do you hear me? I'm going to the pub for another bottle of whiskey. Stay till I come back. Don't move. I'm confused, dizzy from the sherry. I don't know what you're supposed to do with grieving Englishmen. Mrs. Harrington, you look lovely in the bed. But you're a Protestant, already doomed, in hell, like Theresa. Priest said, Outside the Church there is no salvation. Wait, I might be able to save your soul. Baptize you Catholic. Make up for what I did to Theresa. I'll get some water. Oh, God, the door is locked. Why? Maybe you're not dead at all? Watching me. Are you dead, Mrs. Harrington? I'm not afraid. Your face is icy. Oh, you're dead all right. I'll baptize you with sherry from bloody Catholic fascist Spain. I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son, the- What the bloody hell are you doing? Get off my wife, you wretched Papist twit. What primitive Paddy ritual is this? Did you touch her? Did you? I'll wring your scrawny neck. I - I, - Oi, Oi, speak English, you scrap. I was just, a little sherry to get her into heaven. Heaven? We had heaven, Ann, I, our daughter, Emily. You'll never lay your pink piggy eyes on her. Oh, Christ, I can't stand it. Here, more sherry. Ah, no, thanks. Ah, no thanks. That puny Celtic whine. You people love your alcohol. Helps you crawl and whine better. Of course you want food. You have the collapsed look of a starving Paddy. Here. Ham. Eat. Ah, no thanks. Ah, no thanks. Say that again and I'll ram the ham up your arse. He waves a ham sandwich at me, with the heel of his hand pushes it into my mouth. He collapses into a chair. Oh, God, God, what am I to do? Must rest a moment. My stomach heaves. I rush to the window, stick my head out and throw up. He leaps from the chair and charges me. You, you, God blast you to hell, you vomited on my wife's rosebush. He lunges at me, misses, falls to the floor. I climb out the window, hang on to the ledge. He's at the window, grabbing at my hands. I let go, drop to the rosebush, into the ham sandwich and sherry I've just thrown up. I'm pricked by rose thorns, stung, my ankle is twisted. He's at the window, barking, Come back here, you Irish runt. He'll report me to the post office. He hits me in the back with the whiskey bottle, pleads, Will you not watch one hour with me? He pelts me with sherry glasses, whiskey glasses, assorted ham sandwiches, items from his wife's dressing table, powders, creams, brushes. I climb on my bike and wobble through the streets of Limerick, dizzy with sherry and pain. Mrs. O'Connell attacks me, Seven telegrams, one address, and you're gone all day. I was, I was, You was. You was. Drunk is what you was. Drunk is what you are. Reeking. Oh, we heard. That nice man rang, Mr. Harrington, lovely Englishman that sounds like James Mason. Lets you in to say a prayer for his poor wife and next thing you're out the window with the sherry and the ham. Your poor mother. What she brought into the world. He made me eat the ham, drink the sherry. Made you? Jesus, that's a good one. Made you. Mr. Harrington is a refined Englishman and there is no reason for him to lie and we don't want your kind in this post office, people that can't keep their hands off the ham and sherry, so hand in your telegram pouch and bicycle for your days are done in this post office. But I need the job. I have to save and go to America. America. Sad day when America lets in the likes of you. I hobble through the streets of Limerick. I'd like to go back and throw a brick through Mr. Harrington's window. No. Respect for the dead. I'll go across the Sarsfield Bridge and out the riverbank where I can lie down somewhere in the bushes. I don't know how I can go home and tell my mother I lost my job. Have to go home. Have to tell her. Can't stay out the riverbank all night. She'd be frantic. Mam begs the post office to take me back. They say no. They never heard the likes. Telegram boy mauling corpse. Telegram boy fleeing scene with ham and sherry. He will never set foot in the post office again. No. She gets a letter from the parish priest. Take the boy back, says the parish priest. Oh, yes, Father, indeed, says the post office. They'll let me stay till my sixteenth birthday, not a minute longer. Besides, says Mrs. O'Connell, when you think of what the English did to us for eight hundred years that man had no right to complain over a little ham and sherry. Compare a little ham and sherry to the Great Famine and where are you? If my poor husband was alive and I told him what you did he'd say you struck a blow, Frank McCourt, struck a blow. Every Saturday morning I swear I'll go to confession and tell the priest of my impure acts at home, on lonely boreens around Limerick with cows and sheep gawking, on the heights of Carrigogunnell with the world looking up. I'll tell him about Theresa Carmody and how I sent her to hell, and that will be the end of me, driven from the Church. Theresa is a torment to me. Every time I deliver a telegram to her street, every time I pass the graveyard I feel the sin growing in me like an abscess and if I don't go to confession soon I'll be nothing but an abscess riding around on a bicycle with people pointing and telling each other, There he is, there's Frankie McCourt, the dirty thing that sent Theresa Carmody to hell. I look at people going to Communion on Sundays, everyone in a state of grace, returning to their seats with God in their mouths, peaceful, easy, ready to die at any moment and go straight to heaven or go home to their rashers and eggs without a worry in the world. I'm worn out from being the worst sinner in Limerick. I want to get rid of this sin and have rashers and eggs and no guilt, no torment. I want to be ordinary. The priests tell us all the time that God's mercy is infinite but how can any priest give absolution to someone like me who delivers telegrams and winds up in a state of excitement on a green sofa with a girl dying of the galloping consumption. I cycle all around Limerick with telegrams and stop at every church. I ride from Redemptorists to Jesuits to Augustinians to Dominicans to Franciscans. I kneel before the statue of St. Francis of Assisi and beg him to help me but I think he's too disgusted with me. I kneel with people in the pews next to confessionals but when my turn comes I can't breathe, my heart pounds, my forehead turns cold and clammy and I run from the church. I swear I'll go to confession at Christmas. I can't. Easter. I can't. Weeks and months pass and it's a year since Theresa died. I'll go on her anniversary but I can't. I'm fifteen now and I pass churches without stopping. I'll have to wait till I go to America where there are priests like Bing Crosby in Going My Way who won't kick me out of the confessional like Limerick priests. I still have the sin in me, the abscess, and I hope it doesn't kill me entirely before I see the American priest. There's a telegram for an old woman, Mrs. Brigid Finucane. She says, How old are you, by? Fifteen and a half, Mrs. Finucane. Young enough to make a fool of yourself and ould enough to know better. Are you shmart, by? Are you anyway intelligent? I can read and write, Mrs. Finucane. Arrah, there are people above in the lunatic asylum can read and write. Can you write a letter? I can. She wants me to write letters to her customers. If you need a suit or dress for your child you can go to her. She gives you a ticket to a shop and they give you the clothes. She gets a discount and charges you the full price and interest on top. You pay her back weekly. Some of her customers fall behind in their payments and they need threatening letters. She says, I'll give you threepence for every letter you write and another threepence if it brings a payment. If you want the job come here on Thursday and Friday nights, and bring your own paper and envelopes. I'm desperate for that job. I want to go to America. But I have no money for paper and envelopes. Next day I'm delivering a telegram to Woolworth's and there is the answer, a whole section packed with paper and envelopes. I have no money so I have to help myself. But how? Two dogs save the day for me, two dogs at the door of Woolworth's stuck together after the excitement. They yelp and run in circles. Customers and sales clerks giggle and pretend to be looking someplace else and while they're busy pretending I slip paper and envelopes under my sweater, out the door and off on my bike far from stuck dogs. Mrs. Finucane looks suspicious. That's very fancy stationery you have there, by. Is that your mother's? You'll give that back when you get the money, won't you, by? Oh, I will. From now on I'm never to come to her front door. There's a lane behind her house and I'm to come in the back door for fear someone might see me. In a large ledger she gives me the names and addresses of six customers behind in their payments. Threaten 'em, by. Frighten the life out of 'em. My first letter, Dear Mrs. O'Brien, Inasmuch as you have not seen fit to pay me what you owe me I may be forced to resort to legal action. There's your son, Michael, parading around the world in his new suit which I paid for while I myself have barely a crust to keep body and soul together. I am sure you don't want to languish in the dungeons of Limerick jail far from friends and family. I remain, yours in litigious anticipation, Mrs. Brigid Finucane She tells me, That's a powerful letter, by, better than anything you'd read in the Limerick Leader. That word, inasmuch, that's a holy terror of a word. What does it mean? I think it means this is your last chance. I write five more letters and she gives me money for stamps. On my way to the post office I think, Why should I squander money on stamps when I have two legs to deliver the letters myself in the dead of night? When you're poor a threatening letter is a threatening letter no matter how it comes in the door. I run through the lanes of Limerick shoving letters under doors, praying no one will see me. The next week Mrs. Finucane is squealing with joy. Four of 'em paid. Oh, sit down now and write more, by. Put the fear of God in 'em. Week after week my threatening letters grow sharper and sharper. I begin to throw in words I hardly understand myself. Dear Mrs. O'Brien, Inasmuch as you have not succumbed to the imminence of litigation in our previous epistle be advised that we are in consultation with our barrister above in Dublin. Next week Mrs. O'Brien pays. She came in tremblin' with tears in her eyes, by, and she promised she'd never miss another payment. On Friday nights Mrs. Finucane sends me to a pub for a bottle of sherry. You're too young for sherry, by. You can make yourself a nice cup of tea but you have to use the tea leaves left over from this morning. No, you can't have a piece of bread with the prices they're charging. Bread is it? Next thing you'll be asking for an egg. She rocks by the fire, sipping her sherry, counting the money in the purse on her lap, entering payments in her ledger before she locks everything in the trunk under her bed upstairs. After a few sherries she tells me what a lovely thing it is to have a little money so you can leave it to the Church for Masses to be said for the repose of your soul. It makes her so happy to think of priests saying Masses for her years and years after she's dead and buried. Sometimes she falls asleep and if the purse drops to the floor I help myself to an extra few shillings for the overtime and the use of all the big new words. There will be less money for the priests and their Masses but how many Masses does a soul need and surely I'm entitled to a few pounds after the way the Church slammed doors in my face? They wouldn't let me be an altar boy, a secondary school pupil, a missionary with the White Fathers. I don't care. I have a post office savings account and if I keep writing successful threatening letters, helping myself to the odd few shillings from her purse and keeping the stamp money, I'll have my escape money to America. If my whole family dropped from the hunger I wouldn't touch this money in the post office. Often I have to write threatening letters to neighbors and friends of my mother and I worry they might discover me. They complain to Mam, That oul' bitch, Finucane, below in Irishtown, sent me a threatening letter. What kind of a demon outa hell would torment her own kind with a class of a letter that I can't make head nor tail of anyway with words never heard on land or sea. The person that would write that letter is worse than Judas or any informer for the English. My mother says anyone that writes such letters should be boiled in oil and have his fingernails pulled out by blind people. I'm sorry for their troubles but there's no other way for me to save the money for America. I know that someday I'll be a rich Yank and send home hundreds of dollars and my family will never have to worry about threatening letters again. *** Some of the temporary telegram boys are taking the permanent exam in August. Mrs. O'Connell says, You should take that exam, Frank McCourt. You have a bit of a brain in your head and you'd pass it no bother. You'd be a postman in no time and a great help to your poor mother. Mam says I should take it, too, become a postman, save up, go to America and be a postman over there and wouldn't that be a lovely life. I'm delivering a telegram to South's pub on a Saturday and Uncle Pa Keating is sitting there, all black as usual. He says, Have a lemonade there, Frankie, or is it a pint you want now that you're near sixteen? Lemonade, Uncle Pa, thanks. You'll want your first pint the day you're sixteen, won't you? I will but my father won't be here to get it for me. Don't worry about that. I know 'tis not the same without your father but I'll get you the first pint. 'Tis what I'd do if I had a son. Come here the night before you're sixteen. I will, Uncle Pa. I hear you're taking that exam for the post office? I am. Why would you do a thing like that? 'Tis a good job and I'd be a postman in no time and it has the pension. Ah, pension my arse. Sixteen years of age an' talking about the pension. Is it coddin' me you are? Do you hear what I said, Frankie? Pension my arse. If you pass the exam you'll stay in the post office nice and secure the rest of your life. You'll marry a Brigid and have five little Catholics and grow little roses in your garden. You'll be dead in your head before you're thirty and dried in your ballocks the year before. Make up your own bloody mind and to hell with the safeshots and the begrudgers. Do you hear me, Frankie McCourt? I do, Uncle Pa. That's what Mr. O'Halloran said. What did he say? Make up your own mind. True for Mr. O'Halloran. 'Tis your life, make your own decisions and to hell with the begrudgers, Frankie. In the heel o' the hunt you'll be going to America anyway, won't you? I will, Uncle Pa. The day of the exam I'm excused from work. There's a sign in an office window on O'Connell Street, SMART BOY WANTED, NEAT HANDWRITING, GOOD AT SUMS, APPLY HERE TO MANAGER, MR. MCCAFFREY, EASONS LTD. I stand outside the place of the exam, the house of the Limerick Protestant Young Men's Association. There are boys from all over Limerick climbing the steps to take the exam and a man at the door is handing them sheets of paper and pencils and barking at them to hurry up, hurry up. I look at the man at the door, I think of Uncle Pa Keating and what he said, I think of the sign in Easons' office, SMART BOY WANTED. I don't want to go in that door and pass that exam for if I do I'll be a permanent telegram boy with a uniform, then a postman, then a clerk selling stamps for the rest of my life. I'll be in Limerick forever, growing roses with my head dead and my ballocks all dried up. The man at the door says, You, are you coming in here or are you goin' to stand there with your face hanging out? I want to say to the man, Kiss my arse, but I still have a few weeks left in the post office and he might report me. I shake my head and walk up the street where a smart boy is wanted. The manager, Mr. McCaffrey, says, I would like to see a specimen of your handwriting, to see, in short, if you have a decent fist. Sit down there at that table. Write your name and address and write me a paragraph explaining why you came here for this job and how you propose to rise in the ranks of Eason and Son, Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assiduity where there is great opportunity in this company for a boy that will keep his eye on the guidon ahead and guard his flanks from the siren call of sin. I write, Frank McCourt, 4 Little Barrington Street, Limerick City, County Limerick, Ireland I am applying for this job so that I can rise to the highest ranks of Easons Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assadooty knowing that if I keep my eyes ahead and protect my flanks I'll be safe from all temptation and a credit to Easons and Ireland in general. What's this? says Mr. McCaffrey. Do we have here a twisting of the truth? I don't know, Mr. McCaffrey. Little Barrington Street. That's a lane. Why are you calling it a street? You live in a lane, not a street. They call it a street, Mr. McCaffrey. Don't be getting above yourself, boy. Oh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey. You live in a lane and that means you have nowhere to go but up. Do you understand that, McCourt? I do, sir. You have to work your way out of the lane, McCourt. I do, Mr. McCaffrey. You have the cut and jib of a lane boy, McCourt. Yes, Mr. McCaffrey. You have the look of the lane all over you. All over you from poll to toe cap. Don't try to fool the populace, McCourt. You'd have to rise early in the morning to fool the likes of me. Oh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey. Then there's the eyes. Very sore eyes you have there. Can you see? I can, Mr. McCaffrey. You can read and write but can you do addition and subtraction? I can, Mr. McCaffrey. Well, I don't know what the policy is on sore eyes. I would have to ring Dublin and see where they stand on sore eyes. But your writing is clear, McCourt. A good fist. We'll take you on pending the decision on the sore eyes. Monday morning. Half six at the railway station. In the morning? In the morning. We don't give out the bloody morning papers at night, do we? No, Mr. McCaffrey. Another thing. We distribute The Irish Times, a Protestant paper, run by the freemasons in Dublin. We pick it up at the railway station. We count it. We take it to the newsagents. But we don't read it. I don't want to see you reading it. You could lose the Faith and by the look of those eyes you could lose your sight. Do you hear me, McCourt? I do, Mr. McCaffrey. No IrishTimes, and when you come in next week I'll tell you about all the English filth you're not to read in this office. Do you hear me? I do, Mr. McCaffrey. Mrs. O'Connell has the tight mouth and she won't look at me. She says to Miss Barry, I hear a certain upstart from the lanes walked away from the post office exam. Too good for it, I suppose. True for you, says Miss Barry. Too good for us, I suppose. True for you. Do you think he'd ever tell us why he didn't take the exam? Oh, he might, says Miss Barry, if we went down on our two knees. I tell her, I want to go to America, Mrs. O'Connell. Did you hear that, Miss Barry? I did, indeed, Mrs. O'Connell. He spoke. He did, indeed. He will rue the day, Miss Barry. Rue he will, Mrs. O'Connell. Mrs. O'Connell talks past me to the boys waiting on the bench for their telegrams, This is Frankie McCourt who thinks he's too good for the post office. I don't think that, Mrs. O'Connell. And who asked you to open your gob, Mr. High and Mighty? Too grand for us, isn't he, boys? He is, Mrs. O'Connell. And after all we did for him, giving him the telegrams with the good tips, sending him to the country on fine days, taking him back after his disgraceful behavior with Mr. Harrington, the Englishman, disrespecting the body of poor Mrs. Harrington, stuffing himself with ham sandwiches, getting fluthered drunk on sherry, jumping out the window and destroying every rosebush in sight, coming in here three sheets to the wind, and who knows what else he did delivering telegrams for two years, who knows indeed, though we have a good idea, don't we, Miss Barry? We do, Mrs. O'Connell, though 'twouldn't be a fit subject to be talking about. She whispers to Miss Barry and they look at me and shake their heads. A disgrace he is to Ireland and his poor mother. I hope she never finds out. But what would you expect of one born in America and his father from the North. We put up with all that and still took him back. She keeps talking past me again to the boys on the bench. Going to work for Easons he is, working for that pack of freemasons and Protestants above in Dublin. Too good for the post office but ready and willing to deliver all kinds of filthy English magazines all over Limerick. Every magazine he touches will be a mortal sin. But he's leaving now, so he is, and a sorry day it is for his poor mother that prayed for a son with a pension to take care of her in her latter days. So here, take your wages and go from the sight of us. Miss Barry says, He's a bad boy, isn't he, boys? He is, Miss Barry. I don't know what to say. I don't know what I did wrong. Should I say I'm sorry? Good-bye? I lay my belt and pouch on Mrs. O'Connell's desk. She glares at me, Go on. Go to your job at Easons. Go from us. Next boy, come up for your telegrams. They're back at work and I'm down the stairs to the next part of my life. XVII I don't know why Mrs. O'Connell had to shame me before the whole world, and I don't think I'm too good for the post office or anything else. How could I with my hair sticking up, pimples dotting my face, my eyes red and oozing yellow, my teeth crumbling with the rot, no shoulders, no flesh on my arse after cycling thirteen thousand miles to deliver twenty thousand telegrams to every door in Limerick and regions beyond? Mrs. O'Connell said a long time ago she knew everything about every telegram boy. She must know about the times I went at myself on top of Carrigogunnell, milkmaids gawking, little boys looking up. She must know about Theresa Carmody and the green sofa, how I got her into a state of sin and sent her to hell, the worst sin of all, worse than Carrigogunnell a thousand times. She must know I never went to confession after Theresa, that I'm doomed to hell myself. A person that commits a sin like that is never too good for the post office or anything else. The barman at South's remembers me from the time I sat with Mr. Hannon, Bill Galvin, Uncle Pa Keating, black white black. He remembers my father, how he spent his wages and his dole while singing patriotic songs and making speeches from the dock like a condemned rebel. And what is it you'd like? says the barman. I'm here to meet Uncle Pa Keating and have my first pint. Oh, begod, is that a fact? He'll be here in a minute and sure there's no reason why I shouldn't draw his pint and maybe draw your first pint, is there now? There isn't, sir. Uncle Pa comes in and tells me sit next to him against the wall. The barman brings the pints, Uncle Pa pays, lifts his glass, tells the men in the pub, This is my nephew, Frankie McCourt, son of Angela Sheehan, the sister of my wife, having his first pint, here's to your health and long life, Frankie, may you live to enjoy the pint but not too much. The men lift their pints, nod, drink, and there are creamy lines on their lips and mustaches. I take a great gulp of my pint and Uncle Pa tells me, Slow down for the love o' Jasus, don't drink it all, there's more where that came from as long as the Guinness family stays strong and healthy. I tell him I want to stand him a pint with my last wages from the post office but he says, No, take the money home to your mother and you can stand me a pint when you come home from America flushed with success and the heat from a blonde hanging on your arm. The men in the pub are talking about the terrible state of the world and how in God's name Hermann Goering escaped the hangman an hour before the hanging. The Yanks are over there in Nuremberg declaring they don't know how the Nazi bastard hid that pill. Was it in his ear? Up his nostril? Up his arse? Surely the Yanks looked in every hole and cranny of every Nazi they captured and still Hermann wiped their eye. There you are. It shows you can sail across the Atlantic, land in Normandy, bomb Germany off the face of the earth, but when all's said and done they can't find a little pill planted in the far reaches of Goering's fat arse. Uncle Pa buys me another pint. It's harder to drink because it fills me and makes my belly bulge. The men are talking about concentration camps and the poor Jews that never harmed a soul, men, women, children crammed into ovens, children, mind you, what harm could they do, little shoes scattered everywhere, crammed in, and the pub is misty and the voices fading in and out. Uncle Pa says, Are you all right? You're as white as a sheet. He takes me to the lavatory and the two of us have a good long piss against the wall which keeps moving back and forth. I can't go into the pub again, cigarette smoke, stale Guinness, Goering's fat arse, small shoes scattered, can't go in again, good night, Uncle Pa, thanks, and he tells me go straight home to my mother, straight home, oh, he doesn't know about the excitement in the loft or the excitement on the green sofa or me in such a state of doom that if I died now I'd be in hell in a wink. Uncle Pa goes back to his pint. I'm out on O'Connell Street and why shouldn't I take the few steps to the Jesuits and tell all my sins this last night I'll be fifteen. I ring the bell at the priests'house and a big man answers, Yes? I tell him, I want to go to confession, Father. He says, I'm not a priest. Don't call me father. I'm a brother. All right, Brother. I want to go to confession before I'm sixteen tomorrow. State o' grace on my birthday. He says, Go away. You're drunk. Child like you drunk as a lord ringing for a priest at this hour. Go away or I'll call the guards. Ah, don't. Ah, don't. I only want to go to confession. I'm doomed. You're drunk and you're not in a proper spirit of repentance. He closes the door in my face. Another door closed in the face, but I'm sixteen tomorrow and I ring again. The brother opens the door, swings me around, kicks my arse and sends me tripping down the steps. He says, Ring this bell again and I'll break your hand. Jesuit brothers are not supposed to talk like that. They're supposed to be like Our Lord, not walking the world threatening people's hands. I'm dizzy. I'll go home to bed. I hold on to railings along Barrington Street and keep to the wall going down the lane. Mam is by the fire smoking a Woodbine, my brothers upstairs in the bed. She says, That's a nice state to come home in. It's hard to talk but I tell her I had my first pint with Uncle Pa. No father to get me the first pint. Your Uncle Pa should know better. I stagger to a chair and she says, Just like your father. I try to control the way my tongue moves in my mouth. I'd rather be, I'd rather, rather be like my father than Laman Griffin. She turns away from me and looks into the ashes in the range but I won't leave her alone because I had my pint, two pints, and I'm sixteen tomorrow, a man. Did you hear me? I'd rather be like my father than Laman Griffin. She stands up and faces me. Mind your tongue, she says. Mind your own bloody tongue. Don't talk to me like that. I'm your mother. I'll talk to you any bloody way I like. You have a mouth like a messenger boy. Do I? Do I? Well, I'd rather be a messenger boy than the likes of Laman Griffin oul' drunkard with the snotty nose and his loft and people climbing up there with him. She walks away from me and I follow her upstairs to the small room. She turns, Leave me alone, leave me alone, and I keep barking at her, Laman Griffin, Laman Griffin, till she pushes me, Get out of this room, and I slap her on the cheek so that tears jump in her eyes and there's a small whimpering sound from her, You'll never have the chance to do that again, and I back away from her because there's another sin on my long list and I'm ashamed of myself. I fall into my bed, clothes and all, and wake up in the middle of the night puking on my pillow, my brothers complaining of the stink, telling me clean up, I'm a disgrace. I hear my mother crying and I want to tell her I'm sorry but why should I after what she did with Laman Griffin. In the morning my small brothers are gone to school, Malachy is out looking for a job, Mam is at the fire drinking tea. I place my wages on the table by her elbow and turn to go. She says, Do you want a cup of tea? No. 'Tis your birthday. I don't care. She calls up the lane after me, You should have something in your stomach, but I give her my back and turn the corner without answering. I still want to tell her I'm sorry but if I do I'll want to tell her she's the cause of it all, that she should not have climbed to the loft that night and I don't give a fiddler's fart anyway because I'm still writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane and saving to go to America. I have the whole day before I go to Mrs. Finucane to write the threatening letters and I wander down Henry Street till the rain drives me into the Franciscan church where St. Francis stands with his birds and lambs. I look at him and wonder why I ever prayed to him. No, I didn't pray, I begged. I begged him to intercede for Theresa Carmody but he never did a thing, stood up there on his pedestal with the little smile, the birds, the lambs, and didn't give a fiddler's fart about Theresa or me. I'm finished with you, St. Francis. Moving on. Francis. I don't know why they ever gave me that name. I'd be better off if they called me Malachy, one a king, the other a great saint. Why didn't you heal Theresa? Why did you let her go to hell? You let my mother climb to the loft. You let me get into a state of doom. Little children's shoes scattered in concentration camps. I have the abscess again. It's in my chest and I'm hungry. St. Francis is no help, he won't stop the tears bursting out of my two eyes, the sniffling and choking and the God oh Gods that have me on my knees with my head on the back of the pew before me and I'm so weak with the hunger and the crying I could fall on the floor and would you please help me God or St. Francis because I'm sixteen today and I hit my mother and sent Theresa to hell and wanked all over Limerick and the county beyond and I dread the millstone around my neck. There is an arm around my shoulders, a brown robe, click of black rosary beads, a Franciscan priest. My child, my child, my child. I'm a child and I lean against him, little Frankie on his father's lap, tell me all about Cuchulain, Dad, my story that Malachy can't have or Freddie Leibowitz on the swings. My child, sit here with me. Tell me what troubles you. Only if you want to. I am Father Gregory. I'm sixteen today, Father. Oh, lovely, lovely, and why should that be a trouble to you? I drank my first pint last night. Yes? I hit my mother. God help us, my child. But He will forgive you. Is there anything else? I can't tell you, Father. Would you like to go to confession? I can't, Father. I did terrible things. God forgives all who repent. He sent His only Beloved Son to die for us. I can't tell, Father. I can't. But you could tell St. Francis, couldn't you? He doesn't help me anymore. But you love him, don't you? I do. My name is Francis. Then tell him. We'll sit here and you'll tell him the things that trouble you. If I sit and listen it will only be a pair of ears for St. Francis and Our Lord. Won't that help? I talk to St. Francis and tell him about Margaret, Oliver, Eugene, my father singing Roddy McCorley and bringing home no money, my father sending no money from England, Theresa and the green sofa, my terrible sins on Carrigogunnell, why couldn't they hang Hermann Goering for what he did to the little children with shoes scattered around concentration camps, the Christian Brother who closed the door in my face, the time they wouldn't let me be an altar boy, my small brother Michael walking up the lane with the broken shoe clacking, my bad eyes that I'm ashamed of, the Jesuit brother who closed the door in my face, the tears in Mam's eyes when I slapped her. Father Gregory says, Would you like to sit and be silent, perhaps pray a few minutes? His brown robe is rough against my cheek and there's a smell of soap. He looks at St. Francis and the tabernacle and nods and I suppose he's talking to God. Then he tells me kneel, gives me absolution, tells me say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, three Glory Bes. He tells me God forgives me and I must forgive myself, that God loves me and I must love myself for only when you love God in yourself can you love all God's creatures. But I want to know about Theresa Carmody in hell, Father. No, my child. She is surely in heaven. She suffered like the martyrs in olden times and God knows that's penance enough. You can be sure the sisters in the hospital didn't let her die without a priest. Are you sure, Father? I am, my child. He blesses me again, asks me to pray for him, and I'm happy trotting through the rainy streets of Limerick knowing Theresa is in heaven with the cough gone. Monday morning and it's dawn in the railway station. Newspapers and magazines are piled in bundles along the platform wall. Mr. McCaffrey is there with another boy, Willie Harold, cutting the twine on the bundles, counting, entering the count in a ledger. English newspapers and The Irish Times have to be delivered early, magazines later in the morning. We count out the papers and label them for delivery to shops around the city. Mr. McCaffrey drives the van and stays at the wheel while Willie and I run into shops with bundles and take orders for the next day, add or drop in the ledger. After the papers are delivered we unload the magazines at the office and go home to breakfast for fifty minutes. When I return to the office there are two other boys, Eamon and Peter, already sorting magazines, counting and stuffing them into news agents' boxes along the wall. Small orders are delivered by Gerry Halvey on his messenger bicycle, big orders in the van. Mr. McCaffrey tells me stay in the office so that I can learn to count magazines and enter them in the ledger. The minute Mr. McCaffrey leaves Eamon and Peter pull out a drawer where they hide cigarette butts and light up. They can't believe I don't smoke. They want to know if there's something wrong with me, the bad eyes or the consumption maybe. How can you go out with a girl if you don't smoke? Peter says, Wouldn't you be a right eejit if you were going out the road with the girl and she asked you for a fag and you said you didn't smoke, wouldn't you be a right eejit then? How would you ever get her into a field for a bit of a feel? Eamon says, 'Tis what my father says about men who don't drink, they're not to be trusted. Peter says if you find a man that won't drink or smoke that's a man that's not even interested in girls and you'd want to keep your hand over the hole of your arse, that's what you'd want to be doing. They laugh and that brings on the cough and the more they laugh the more they cough till they're holding on to one another banging one another between the shoulder blades and wiping tears from their cheeks. When the fit passes we pick out English and American magazines and look at the advertisements for women's underwear, brassieres and panties and long nylon stockings. Eamon is looking at an American magazine called See with pictures of Japanese girls who keep the soldiers happy so far away from home and Eamon says he has to go to the lavatory and when he does Peter gives me a wink, You know what he's up to in there, don't you? and sometimes Mr. McCaffrey gets into a state when boys linger in the lavatory interfering with themselves and wasting the valuable time for which Easons is paying them and on top of it putting their immortal souls in danger. Mr. McCaffrey won't come right out and say, Stop that wanking, because you can't accuse someone of a mortal sin unless you have proof. Sometimes he goes snooping in the lavatory when a boy comes out. He comes back himself with the threatening look and tells the boys, Ye are not to be looking at those dirty magazines from foreign parts. Ye are to count them and put them in the boxes and that's all. Eamon comes back from the lavatory and Peter goes in with an American magazine, Collier's, that has pictures of girls in a beauty contest. Eamon says, Do you know what he's doing in there? At himself. Five times a day he goes in. Every time a new American magazine comes in with the women's underwear he goes in. Never done going at himself. Borrows magazines to take home unbeknownst to Mr. McCaffrey and God knows what he does with himself and the magazines all night. If he fell dead in there the jaws of hell would open wide. I'd like to get into the lavatory myself when Peter comes out but I don't want them saying, There he goes, new boy, first day on the job, already at himself. Won't light up a fag oh no but wanks away like an oul' billygoat. Mr. McCaffrey returns from van delivery and wants to know why all the magazines aren't counted out, bundled and ready to go. Peter tells him, We were busy teaching the new boy, McCourt. God help us, he was a bit slow with the bad eyes you know but we kept at him and now he's getting faster. Gerry Halvey, the messenger boy, won't be in for a week because he's entitled to his holidays and he wants to spend the time with his girlfriend, Rose, who's coming back from England. I'm the new boy and I have to be messenger boy while he's gone, cycling around Limerick on the bicycle with the big metal basket in front. He shows me how to balance papers and magazines so that the bicycle won't tip over with me in the saddle and a lorry passing by that will run over me and leave me like a piece of salmon in the road. He saw a soldier once that was run over by an army lorry and that's what he looked like, salmon. Gerry is making a last delivery at Easons kiosk at the railway station at noon on Saturday and that's handy because I can meet him there to get the bicycle and he can meet Rose off the train. We stand at the gate waiting and he tells me he hasn't seen Rose in a year. She's over there working in a pub in Bristol and he doesn't like that one bit because the English are forever pawing the Irish girls, hands up under the skirts and worse, and the Irish girls are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their jobs. Everyone knows Irish girls keep themselves pure especially Limerick girls known the world over for their purity who have a man to come back to like Gerry Halvey himself. He'll be able to tell if she was true to him by her walk. If a girl comes back after a year with a certain class of a walk that's different from the one she went away with then you know she was up to no good with the Englishmen dirty horny bastards that they are. The train hoots into the station and Gerry waves and points to Rose coming toward us from the far end of the train, Rose smiling away with her white teeth and lovely in a green dress. Gerry stops waving and mutters under his breath, Look at the walk on her, bitch, hoor, street walker, flaghopper, trollop, and runs from the station. Rose walks up to me, Was that Gerry Halvey you were standing with? 'Twas. Where is he? Oh, he went out. I know he went out. Where did he go? I don't know. He didn't tell me. He just ran out. Didn't say anything? I didn't hear him say anything. Do you work with him? I do. I'm taking over the bike. What bike? The messenger bike. Is he on a messenger bike? He is. He told me he worked in Easons office, clerk, inside job? I feel desperate. I don't want to make a liar of Gerry Halvey, to get him into trouble with the lovely Rose. Oh, we all take turns on the messenger bike. An hour in the office, an hour on the bike. The manager says 'tis good to get out in the fresh air. Well, I'll just go home and put my suitcase down and go to his house. I thought he'd carry this for me. I have the bike here and you can stick the case in the basket and I'll walk you home. We walk up to her house in Carey's Road and she tells me she's so excited about Gerry. She saved her money in England and now she wants to go back with him and get married even if he's only nineteen and she's only seventeen. What matter when you're in love. I lived like a nun in England and dreamt of him every night and thank you very much for carrying my case. I turn away to jump on the bike and cycle back to Easons when Gerry comes at me from behind. His face is red and he's snorting like a bull. What were you doing with my girl, you little shite? Eh? What? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you did anything with my girl I'll kill you. I didn't do anything. Carried her case because 'twas heavy. Don't look at her again or you're dead. I won't, Gerry. I don't want to look at her. Oh, is that a fact? Is she ugly or what? No, no, Gerry, she's yours and she loves you. How do you know? She told me. She did? She did, honest to God. Jasus. He bangs on her door, Rose, Rose, are you there? and she comes out, Of course, I'm here, and I ride away on the messenger bicycle with the sign on the basket that says Easons wondering about the way he's kissing her now and the terrible things he said about her in the station and wondering how Peter in the office could tell Mr. McCaffrey a barefaced lie about me and my eyes when all the time he and Eamon were looking at girls in their underwear and then going at themselves in the lavatory. Mr. McCaffrey is in a terrible state in the office. Where were you? Great God above in heaven, does it take you all day to cycle from the railway station? We have an emergency here and we should have Halvey but he's gone off on his friggin' holidays, God forgive the language, and you'll have to cycle around as fast as you can, good thing you were a telegram boy that knows every inch of Limerick, and go to every bloody shop that's a customer and walk right in grab whatever copies you see of John O'London's Weekly tear out page sixteen and if anyone bothers you tell them 'tis government orders and they're not to interfere in government business and if they lay a finger on you they're liable to arrest, imprisonment and a large fine now go for God's sake and bring back every page sixteen you tear out so that we can burn them here in the fire. Every shop, Mr. McCaffrey? I'll do the big ones, you do the small ones all the way to Ballinacurra and out the Ennis Road and beyond, God help us. Go on, go. I'm jumping on the bike and Eamon runs down the steps. Hey, McCourt, wait. Listen. Don't give him all the page sixteens when you come back. Why? We can sell 'em, me an' Peter. Why? 'Tis all about birth control and that's banned in Ireland. What's birth control? Aw, Christ above, don't you know anything? 'Tis condoms, you know, rubbers, French letters, things like that to stop the girls from getting up the pole. Up the pole? Pregnant. Sixteen years of age an' you're pure ignorant. Hurry up an' get the pages before everybody starts runnin' to the shop for John O'London's Weekly. I'm about to push away on the bike when Mr. McCaffrey runs down the steps. Hold on, McCourt, we'll go in the van. Eamon, you come with us. What about Peter? Leave him. He'll wind up with a magazine in the lavatory anyway. Mr. McCaffrey talks to himself in the van. Nice bloody how do you do ringing down here from Dublin on a fine Saturday to send us tearing around Limerick ripping pages out of an English magazine when I could be at home with a cup of tea and a nice bun and a read of The Irish Press with my feet up on a box under the picture of the Sacred Heart nice bloody how do you do entirely. Mr. McCaffrey runs into every shop with us behind him. He grabs the magazines, hands each of us a pile and tells us start tearing. Shop owners scream at him, What are ye doing? Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph, is it pure mad ye are? Put back them magazines or I'll call the guards. Mr. McCaffrey tells them, Government orders, ma'am. There is filth in John O'London this week that's not fit for any Irish eyes and we are here to do God's work. What filth? What filth? Show me the filth before ye go mutilatin' the magazines. I won't pay Easons for these magazines, so I won't. Ma'am, we don't care at Easons. We'd rather lose large amounts than have the people of Limerick and Ireland corrupted by this filth. What filth? Can't tell you. Come on, boys. We throw the pages on the floor of the van and when Mr. McCaffrey is in a shop arguing we stuff some into our shirts. There are old magazines in the van and we tear and scatter them so that Mr. McCaffrey will think they're all page sixteen from John O'London. The biggest customer for the magazine, Mr. Hutchinson, tells Mr. McCaffrey get to hell out of his shop or he'll brain him, get away from them magazines, and when Mr. McCaffrey keeps on tearing out pages Mr. Hutchinson throws him into the street, Mr. McCaffrey yelling that this is a Catholic country and just because Hutchinson is a Protestant that doesn't give him the right to sell filth in the holiest city in Ireland. Mr. Hutchinson says, Ah, kiss my arse, and Mr. McCaffrey says, See, boys? See what happens when you're not a member of the True Church? Some shops says they've already sold all their copies of John O'London and Mr. McCaffrey says, Oh, Mother o'God, what's going to become of us all? Who did ye sell them to? He demands the names and address of the customers who are in danger of losing their immortal souls from reading articles on birth control. He will go to their houses and rip out that filthy page but the shopkeepers say, 'Tis Saturday night, McCaffrey, and getting dark and would you ever take a good running jump for yourself. On the way back to the office Eamon whispers to me in the back of the van, I have twenty-one pages. How many do you have? I tell him fourteen but I have over forty and I'm not telling him because you never have to tell the truth to people who lie about your bad eyes. Mr. McCaffrey tells us bring in the pages from the van. We scoop up everything on the floor and he's happy sitting at his desk at the other end of the office ringing Dublin to tell them how he stormed through shops like God's avenger and saved Limerick from the horrors of birth control while he watches a dancing fire of pages that have nothing to do with John O'London's Weekly. Monday morning I cycle through the streets delivering magazines and people see the Easons sign on the bike and stop me to see if there's any chance they could get their hands on a copy of John O'London's Weekly. They're all rich looking people, some in motor cars, men with hats, collars and ties, and two fountain pens in their pockets, women with hats and little bits of fur dangling from their shoulders, people who have tea at the Savoy or the Stella and stick out their little fingers to show how well bred they are and now want to read this page about birth control. Eamon told me early in the day, Don't sell the bloody page for less than five shillings. I asked him if he was joking. No, he wasn't. Everyone in Limerick is talking about this page and they're dying to get their hands on it. Five shillings or nothing, Frankie. If they're rich charge more but that's what I'm charging so don't be going around on your bicycle and puttin' me out of business with low prices. We have to give Peter something or he'll be running to McCaffrey and spilling the beans. Some people are willing to pay seven shillings and sixpence and I'm rich in two days with over ten pounds in my pocket minus one for Peter the snake, who would betray us to McCaffrey. I put eight pounds in the post office for my fare to America and that night we have a big supper of ham, tomatoes, bread, butter, jam. Mam wants to know if I won the sweepstakes and I tell her people give me tips. She's not happy I'm a messenger boy because that's the lowest you can drop in Limerick but if it brings in ham like this we should light a candle in gratitude. She doesn't know the money for my fare is growing in the post office and she'd die if she knew what I was earning from writing threatening letters. Malachy has a new job in the stockroom of a garage handing out parts to mechanics and Mam herself is taking care of an old man, Mr. Sliney, out in the South Circular Road while his two daughters go off to work every day. She tells me if I'm delivering papers out there to come to the house for tea and a sandwich. The daughters will never know and the old man won't mind because he's only half conscious most of the time worn out from all his years in the English army in India. She looks peaceful in the kitchen of this house in her spotless apron, everything clean and polished around her, flowers bobbing in the garden beyond, birds chirping away, music from Radio Eireann on the wireless. She sits at the table with a pot of tea, cups and saucers, plenty of bread, butter, cold meats of all kinds. I can have any class of a sandwich but all I know is ham and brawn. She doesn't have any brawn because that's the kind of thing you'd find people eating in lanes not in a house on the South Circular Road. She says the rich won't eat brawn because it's what they scoop off floors and counters in bacon factories and you never know what you're getting. The rich are very particular about what they stick between two slices of bread. Over in America brawn is called head cheese and she doesn't know why. She gives me a ham sandwich with juicy slices of tomato and tea in a cup with little pink angels flying around shooting arrows at other little flying angels who are blue and I wonder why they can't make teacups and chamber pots without all kinds of angels and maidens cavorting in the glen. Mam says that's the way the rich are, they love the bit of decoration and wouldn't we if we had the money. She'd give her two eyes to have a house like this with flowers and birds abroad in the garden and the wireless playing that lovely Warsaw Concerto or the Dream of Olwyn and no end of cups and saucers with angels shooting arrows. She says she has to look in on Mr. Sliney he's so old and feeble he forgets to call for the chamber pot. Chamber pot? You have to empty his chamber pot? Of course I do. There's a silence here because I think we're remembering the cause of all our troubles, Laman Griffin's chamber pot. But that was a long time ago and now it's Mr. Sliney's chamber pot, which is no harm because she's paid for this and he's harmless. When she comes back she tells me Mr. Sliney would like to see me, so come in while he's awake. He's lying in a bed in the front parlor, the window blocked with a black sheet, no sign of light. He tells my mother, Lift me up a bit, missus, and pull back that bloody thing off the window so I can see the boy. He has long white hair down to his shoulders. Mam whispers he won't let anyone cut it. He says, I have me own teeth, son. Would you credit that? Do you have your own teeth, son? I do, Mr. Sliney. Ah. I was in India you know. Me and Timoney up the road. Bunch of Limerick men in India. Do you know Timoney, son? I did, Mr. Sliney. He's dead, you know. Poor bugger went blind. I have me sight. I have me teeth. Keep your teeth, son. I will, Mr. Sliney. I'm getting tired, son, but there's one thing I want to tell you. Are you listening to me? I am, Mr. Sliney. Is he listening to me, missus? Oh, he is, Mr. Sliney. Good. Now here's what I want to tell you. Lean over here so I can whisper in your ear. What I want to tell you is, Never smoke another man's pipe. *** Halvey goes off to England with Rose and I have to stay on the messenger bike all through the winter. It's a bitter winter, ice everywhere, and I never know when the bike will go out from under me and send me flying into the street or onto the pavement, magazines and papers scattered. Shops complain to Mr. McCaffrey that The Irish Times is coming in decorated with bits of ice and dog shit and he mutters to us that's the way that paper should be delivered, Protestant rag that it is. Every day after my deliveries I take The Irish Times home and read it to see where the danger is. Mam says it's a good thing Dad isn't here. He'd say, Is this what the men of Ireland fought and died for that my own son is sitting there at the kitchen table reading the freemason paper? There are letters to the editor from people all over Ireland claiming they heard the first cuckoo of the year and you can read between the lines that people are calling each other liars. There are reports about Protestant weddings and pictures and the women always look lovelier than the ones we know in the lanes. You can see Protestant women have perfect teeth although Halvey's Rose had lovely teeth. I keep reading The Irish Times and wondering if it's an occasion of sin though I don't care. As long as Theresa Carmody is in heaven not coughing I don't go to confession anymore. I read The Irish Times and TheTimes of London because that tells me what the King is up to every day and what Elizabeth and Margaret are doing. I read English women's magazines for all the food articles and the answers to women's questions. Peter and Eamon put on English accents and pretend they're reading from English women's magazines. Peter says, Dear Miss Hope, I'm going out with a fellow from Ireland named McCaffrey and he has his hands all over me and his thing pushing against my belly button and I'm demented not knowing what to do. I remain, yours anxiously, Miss Lulu Smith, Yorkshire. Eamon says, Dear Lulu, If this McCaffrey is that tall that he's pushing his yoke against your belly button I suggest you find a smaller man who will slip it between your thighs. Surely you can find a decent short man in Yorkshire. Dear Miss Hope, I am thirteen years old with black hair and something terrible is happening and I can't tell anyone not even my mother. I'm bleeding every few weeks you know where and I'm afraid I'll be found out. Miss Agnes Tripple, Little Biddle-on-the-Twiddle, Devon. Dear Agnes, You are to be congratulated. You are now a woman and you can get your hair permed because you are having your monthlies. Do not fear your monthlies for all Englishwomen have them. They are a gift of God to purify us so that we can have stronger children for the empire, soldiers to keep the Irish in their place. In some parts of the world a woman with a monthly is unclean but we British cherish our women with the monthlies, oh we do indeed. In the springtime there's a new messenger boy and I'm back in the office. Peter and Eamon drift off to England. Peter is fed up with Limerick, no girls, and you're driven to yourself, wank wank wank, that's all we ever do in Limerick. There are new boys. I'm senior boy and the job is easier because I'm fast and when Mr. McCaffrey is out in the van and my work is done I read the English, Irish, American magazines and papers. Day and night I dream of America. Malachy goes to England to work in a rich Catholic boys' boarding school and he walks around cheerful and smiling as if he's the equal of any boy in the school and everyone knows when you work in an English boarding school you're supposed to hang your head and shuffle like a proper Irish servant. They fire him for his ways and Malachy tells them they can kiss his royal Irish arse and they say that's the kind of foul language and behavior you'd expect. He gets a job in the gas works in Coventry shoveling coal into the furnaces like Uncle Pa Keating, shoveling coal and waiting for the day he can go to America after me. XVIII I'm seventeen, eighteen, going on nineteen, working away at Easons, writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane, who says she's not long for this world and the more Masses said for her soul the better she'll feel. She puts money in envelopes and sends me to churches around the city to knock on priests' doors, hand in the envelopes with the request for Masses. She wants prayers from all the priests but the Jesuits. She says, They're useless, all head and no heart. That's what they should have over their door in Latin and I won't give them a penny because every penny you give a Jesuit goes to a fancy book or a bottle of wine. She sends the money, she hopes the Masses are said, but she's never sure and if she's not sure why should I be handing out all that money to priests when I need the money to go to America and if I keep back a few pounds for myself and put it in the post office who will ever know the difference and if I say a prayer for Mrs. Finucane and light candles for her soul when she dies won't God listen even if I'm a sinner long past my last confession. I'll be nineteen in a month. All I need is a few pounds to make up the fare and a few pounds in my pocket when I land in America. The Friday night before my nineteenth birthday Mrs. Finucane sends me for the sherry. When I return she is dead in the chair, her eyes wide open, and her purse on the floor wide open. I can't look at her but I help myself to a roll of money. Seventeen pounds. I take the key to the trunk upstairs. I take forty of the hundred pounds in the trunk and the ledger. I'll add this to what I have in the post office and I have enough to go to America. On my way out I take the sherry bottle to save it from being wasted. I sit by the River Shannon near the dry docks sipping Mrs. Finucane's sherry. Aunt Aggie's name is in the ledger. She owes nine pounds. It might have been the money she spent on my clothes a long time ago but now she'll never have to pay it because I heave the ledger into the river. I'm sorry I'll never be able to tell Aunt Aggie I saved her nine pounds. I'm sorry I wrote threatening letters to the poor people in the lanes of Limerick, my own people, but the ledger is gone, no one will ever know what they owe and they won't have to pay their balances. I wish I could tell them, I'm your Robin Hood. Another sip of the sherry. I'll spare a pound or two for a Mass for Mrs. Finucane's soul. Her ledger is well on its way down the Shannon and out to the Atlantic and I know I'll follow it someday soon. The man at O'Riordan's Travel Agency says he can't get me to America by air unless I travel to London first, which would cost a fortune. He can put me on a ship called the Irish Oak, which will be leaving Cork in a few weeks. He says, Nine days at sea, September October, best time of the year, your own cabin, thirteen passengers, best of food, bit of a holiday for yourself and that will cost fifty-five pounds, do you have it? I do. I tell Mam I'm going in a few weeks and she cries. Michael says, Will we all go some day? We will. Alphie says, Will you send me a cowboy hat and a thing you throw that comes back to you? Michael tells him that's a boomerang and you'd have to go all the way to Australia to get the likes of that, you can't get it in America. Alphie says you can get it in America yes you can and they argue about America and Australia and boomerangs till Mam says, For the love o' Jesus, yeer brother is leaving us and the two of ye are there squabbling over boomerangs. Will ye give over? Mam says we'll have to have a bit of party the night before I go. They used to have parties in the old days when anyone would go to America, which was so far away the parties were called American wakes because the family never expected to see the departing one again in this life. She says 'tis a great pity Malachy can't come back from England but we'll be together in America someday with the help of God and His Blessed Mother. On my days off from work I walk around Limerick and look at all the places we lived, the Windmill Street, Hartstonge Street, Roden Lane, Rosbrien Road, Little Barrington Street, which is really a lane. I stand looking at Theresa Carmody's house till her mother comes out and says, What do you want? I sit at the graves of Oliver and Eugene in the old St. Patrick's Burying Ground and cross the road to St. Lawrence's Cemetery where Theresa is buried. Wherever I go I hear voices of the dead and I wonder if they can follow you across the Atlantic Ocean. I want to get pictures of Limerick stuck in my head in case I never come back. I sit in St. Joseph's Church and the Redemptorist church and tell myself take a good look because I might never see this again. I walk down Henry Street to say good-bye to St. Francis though I'm sure I'll be able to talk to him in America. Now there are days I don't want to go to America. I'd like to go to O'Riordan's Travel Agency and get back my fifty-five pounds. I could wait till I'm twenty-one and Malachy can go with me so that I'll know at least one person in New York. I have strange feelings and sometimes when I'm sitting by the fire with Mam and my brothers I feel tears coming and I'm ashamed of myself for being weak. At first Mam laughs and tells me, Your bladder must be near your eye, but then Michael says, We'll all go to America, Dad will be there, Malachy will be there and we'll all be together, and she gets the tears herself and we sit there, the four of us, like weeping eejits. Mam says this is the first time we ever had a party and isn't it a sad thing altogether that you have it when your children are slipping away one by one, Malachy to England, Frank to America. She saves a few shillings from her wages taking care of Mr. Sliney to buy bread, ham, brawn, cheese, lemonade and a few bottles of stout. Uncle Pa Keating brings stout, whiskey and a little sherry for Aunt Aggie's delicate stomach and she brings a cake loaded with currants and raisins she baked herself. The Abbot brings six bottles of stout and says, That's all right, Frankie, ye can all drink it as long as I have a bottle or two for meself to help me sing me song. He sings ""The Road to Rasheen. "" He holds his stout, closes his eyes, and song comes out in a high whine. The words make no sense and everyone wonders why tears are seeping from his shut eyes. Alphie whispers to me, Why is he crying over a song that makes no sense? I don't know. The Abbot ends his song, opens his eyes, wipes his cheeks and tells us that was a sad song about an Irish boy that went to America and got shot by gangsters and died before a priest could reach his side and he tells me don't be gettin' shot if you're not near a priest. Uncle Pa says that's the saddest song he ever heard and is there any chance we could have something lively. He calls on Mam and she says, Ah, no, Pa, sure I don't have the wind. Come on, Angela, come on. One voice now, one voice and one voice only. All right. I'll try. We all join in the chorus of her sad song, A mother's love is a blessing No matter where you roam. Keep her while you have her, You'll miss her when she's gone. Uncle Pa says one song is worse than the one before and are we turning this night into a wake altogether, is there any chance someone would sing a song to liven up the proceedings or will he be driven to drink with the sadness. Oh, God, says Aunt Aggie, I forgot. The moon is having an eclipse abroad this minute. We stand out in the lane watching the moon disappear behind a round black shadow. Uncle Pa says, That's a very good sign for you going to America, Frankie. No, says Aunt Aggie, 'tis a bad sign. I read in the paper that the moon is practicing for the end of the world. Oh, end of the world my arse, says Uncle Pa. 'Tis the beginning for Frankie McCourt. He'll come back in a few years with a new suit and fat on his bones like any Yank and a lovely girl with white teeth hangin' from his arm. Mam says, Ah, no, Pa, ah, no, and they take her inside and comfort her with a drop of sherry from Spain. It's late in the day when the Irish Oak sails from Cork, past Kinsale and Cape Clear, and dark when lights twinkle on Mizen Head, the last of Ireland I'll see for God knows how long. Surely I should have stayed, taken the post office examination, climbed in the world. I could have brought in enough money for Michael and Alphie to go to school with proper shoes and bellies well filled. We could have moved from the lane to a street or even an avenue where houses have gardens. I should have taken that examination and Mam would never again have to empty the chamber pots of Mr. Sliney or anyone else. It's too late now. I'm on the ship and there goes Ireland into the night and it's foolish to be standing on this deck looking back and thinking of my family and Limerick and Malachy and my father in England and even more foolish that songs are going through my head Roddy McCorley goes to die and Mam gasping Oh the days of the Kerry dancing with poor Mr. Clohessy hacking away in the bed and now I want Ireland back at least I had Mam and my brothers and Aunt Aggie bad as she was and Uncle Pa, standing me my first pint, and my bladder is near my eye and here's a priest standing by me on the deck and you can see he's curious. He's a Limerickman but he has an American accent from his years in Los Angeles. He knows how it is to leave Ireland, did it himself and never got over it. You live in Los Angeles with sun and palm trees day in day out and you ask God if there's any chance He could give you one soft rainy Limerick day. The priest sits beside me at the table of the First Officer, who tells us ship's orders have been changed and instead of sailing to New York we're bound for Montreal. Three days out and orders are changed again. We are going to New York after all. Three American passengers complain, Goddam Irish. Can't they get it straight? The day before we sail into New York orders are changed again. We are going to a place up the Hudson River called Albany. The Americans say, Albany? Goddam Albany? Why the hell did we have to sail on a goddam Irish tub? Goddam. The priest tells me pay no attention. All Americans are not like that. I'm on deck the dawn we sail into New York. I'm sure I'm in a film, that it will end and lights will come up in the Lyric Cinema. The priest wants to point out things but he doesn't have to. I can pick out the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge. There are thousands of cars speeding along the roads and the sun turns everything to gold. Rich Americans in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous women with white teeth. The rest are going to work in warm comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world. The Americans are arguing with the captain and a man who climbed aboard from a tugboat. Why can't we get off here? Why do we have to sail all the goddam way to goddam Albany? The man says, Because you're passengers on the vessel and the captain is the captain and we have no procedures for taking you ashore. Oh, yeah. Well, this is a free country and we're American citizens. Is that a fact? Well, you're on an Irish ship with an Irish captain and you'll do what he goddam tells you or swim ashore. He climbs down the ladder, tugboat chugs away, and we sail up the Hudson past Manhattan, under the George Washington Bridge, past hundreds of Liberty ships that did their bit in the war, moored now and ready to rot. The captain announces the tide will force us to drop anchor overnight opposite a place called, the priest spells it for me, Poughkeepsie. The priest says that's an Indian name and the Americans say goddam Poughkeepsie. After dark a small boat put-puts to the ship and an Irish voice calls up, Hello, there. Bejasus, I saw the Irish flag, so I did. Couldn't believe me two eyes. Hello, there. He invites the First Officer to go ashore for a drink and bring a friend and, You, too, Father. Bring a friend. The priest invites me and we climb down a ladder to the small boat with the First Officer and the Wireless Officer. The man in the boat says his name is Tim Boyle from Mayo God help us and we docked there at the right time because there's a bit of a party and we're all invited. He takes us to a house with a lawn, a fountain and three pink birds standing on one leg. There are five women in a room called a living room. The women have stiff hair, spotless frocks. They have glasses in their hands and they're friendly and smile with perfect teeth. One says, Come right in. Just in time for the pawty. Pawty. That's the way they talk and I suppose I'll be talking like that in a few years. Tim Boyle tells us the girls are having a bit of a time while their husbands are away overnight hunting deer, and one woman, Betty, says, Yeah. Buddies from the war. That war is over nearly five years and they can't get over it so they shoot animals every weekend and drink Rheingold till they can't see. Goddam war, excuse the language, Fawder. The priest whispers to me, These are bad women. We won't stay here long. The bad women say, Whatcha like to drink? We got everything. What's your name, honey? Frank McCourt. Nice name. So you take a little drink. All the Irish take a little drink. You like a beer? Yes, please. Gee, so polite. I like the Irish. My grandmother was half Irish so that makes me half, quarter? I dunno. My name is Frieda. So here's your beer, honey. The priest sits at the end of a sofa which they call a couch and two women talk to him. Betty asks the First Officer if he'd like to see the house and he says, Oh, I would, because we don't have houses like this in Ireland. Another woman tells the Wireless Officer he should see what they have growing in the garden, you wouldn't believe the flowers. Frieda asks me if I'm okay and I tell her yes but would she mind telling me where the lavatory is. The what? Lavatory. Oh, you mean the bathroom. Right this way, honey, down the hall. Thanks. She pushes in the door, turns on the light, kisses my cheek and whispers she'll be right outside if I need anything. I stand at the toilet bowl firing away and wonder what I'd need at a time like this and if this is a common thing in America, women waiting outside while you take a splash. I finish, flush and go outside. She takes my hand and leads me into a bedroom, puts down her glass, locks the door, pushes me down on the bed. She's fumbling at my fly. Damn buttons. Don't you have zippers in Ireland? She pulls out my excitement climbs up on me slides up and down up and down Jesus I'm in heaven and there's a knock on the door the priest Frank are you in there Frieda putting her finger to her lips and her eyes rolling to heaven Frank are you in there Father would you ever take a good running jump for yourself and oh God oh Theresa do you see what's happening to me at long last I don't give a fiddler's fart if the Pope himself knocked on this door and the College of Cardinals gathered gawking at the windows oh God the whole inside of me is gone into her and she collapses on me and tells me I'm wonderful and would I ever consider settling in Poughkeepsie. Frieda tells the priest I had a bit of a dizziness after going to the bathroom, that's what happens when you travel and you're drinking a strange beer like Rheingold, which she believes they don't have in Ireland. I can see the priest doesn't believe her and I can't stop the way the heat is coming and going in my face. He already wrote down my mother's name and address and now I'm afraid he'll write and say your fine son spent his first night in America in a bedroom in Poughkeepsie romping with a woman whose husband was away shooting deer for a bit of relaxation after doing his bit for America in the war and isn't this a fine way to treat the men who fought for their country. The First Officer and the Wireless Officer return from their tours of the house and the garden and they don't look at the priest. The women tell us we must be starving and they go into the kitchen. We sit in the living room saying nothing to each other and listening to the women whispering and laughing in the kitchen. The priest whispers to me again, Bad women, bad women, occasion of sin, and I don't know what to say to him. The bad women bring out sandwiches and pour more beer and when we finish eating they put on Frank Sinatra records and ask if anyone would like to dance. No one says yes because you'd never get up and dance with bad women in the presence of a priest, so the women dance with each other and laugh as if they all had little secrets. Tim Boyle drinks whiskey and falls asleep in a corner till Frieda wakes him and tells him take us back to the ship. When we're leaving Frieda leans toward me as if she might kiss my cheek but the priest says good night in a very sharp way and no one shakes hands. As we walk down the street to the river we hear the women laughing, tinkling and bright in the night air. We climb the ladder and Tim calls to us from his little boat, Mind yourselves going up that ladder. Oh, boys, oh, boys, wasn't that a grand night? Good night, boys, and good night, Father. We watch his little boat till it disappears into the dark of the Pough- keepsie riverbank. The priest says good night and goes below and the First Officer follows him. I stand on the deck with the Wireless Officer looking at the lights of America twinkling. He says, My God, that was a lovely night, Frank. Isn't this a great country altogether? XIX 'Tis."

Mes enfants On s'en souviendra longtemps Dans dix ans, on parlera Encore de la noce à Rebecca Il y avait eut un grand déjeuner La p'tite Rebecca avait l' ventre gonflé Son mari, un type sans façon Dut déboutonner son pantalon L' docteur Blum mangeait avec ses doigts Sa femme lui dit par deux fois : Ça te donne un très mauvais air Tu n'as donc pas de couvert ? Il lui répondit vivement : Ne me fais pas d' reproche Comme il était en argent Je l'ai mis dans ma poche {au Refrain} Après l' déjeuner, on dansa Les onze frères Hartmann n'attendaient qu' ça Mais ils y mirent tant d'ardeur Que cela provoqua des malheurs Voilà que, de la poche d'un gousset Deux sous tombèrent sur le parquet Tout le monde se précipita Une bagarre éclata Madame Kaufmann fut blessée Et conduite à l'hospice Les deux sous furent retrouvés Cachés entre ses cuisses {au Refrain} Pour calmer tous les invités Qui se montraient un peu surexcités Rebecca joua du piano Le fils Lévy vendit deux manteaux L'oncle Schwartz offrit des cigares Monsieur Smoutz en prit un dare-dare Mais il dit au moment d' fumer : J'ai l' bout qu'est pas coupé ! L' père Mayer cria très fort : Pas coupé !... C'est tragique Mais foutez-moi c't homme-là dehors C'est un sale catholique ! {au Refrain}"

Lijo: ALBERTO NISMAN, Fiscal General, titular de la Unidad Fiscal de Investigación del atentado perpetrado el 18 de julio de 1994 contra la sede de la AMIA [causa 3446/2012, “Velazco, Carlos Alfredo y otros por abuso de autoridad y violación de los deberes de funcionario público, del Juzgado Nacional en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal N° 4, Secretaría N° 8] ante V.S. respetuosamente me presento y digo:  I.- Objeto En cumplimiento del mandato legal impuesto en el artículo 177 inciso Io del Código Procesal Penal de la Nación, como representante del Ministerio Público Fiscal a cargo de la Unidad de Investigación de la causa “AMIA” vengo, por la presente, a denunciar la existencia de un plan delictivo destinado a dotar de impunidad a los imputados de nacionalidad iraní acusados en dicha causa, para que eludan la investigación y se sustraigan de la acción de la justicia argentina, con competencia en el caso. Esta confabulación ha sido orquestada y puesta en funcionamiento por altas autoridades del gobierno nacional argentino, con la colaboración de terceros, en lo que constituye un accionar criminal configurativo, a priori, de los delitos de encubrimiento por favorecimiento personal agravado, impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional e incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionario público (arts. 277 inc. 1 y 3, 241 inc. 2 y 248 del Código Penal). Esto resulta de la mayor gravedad teniendo en cuenta que el hecho cuyo encubrimiento se denuncia, es decir, el atentado terrorista perpetrado contra la sede de la AMIA, ha sido judicialmente declarado crimen de lesa humanidad y calificado como genocidio por el Sr. Juez de la causa. La decisión deliberada de encubrir a los imputados de origen iraní acusados por el atentado terrorista del 18 de julio de 1994, como surge de las evidencias halladas, fue tomada por la cabeza del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional, Dra. Cristina Elisabet Fernández de Kirchner e instrumentada, principalmente, por el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, Sr. Héctor Marcos Timerman. Asimismo, las pruebas examinadas revelan la intervención activa en el plan encubridor de varios sujetos con distintos grados de participación y responsabilidad que la pesquisa deberá precisar, entre los que cabe mencionar a: Luis Angel D’Elía, Femando Luis Esteche, Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, el Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, el Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia y un individuo identificado como “Alian”, que ha desempeñado un rol por demás relevante en los hechos, que responde a la Secretaria de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación y según lo sugieren los indicios obtenidos, se trataría del Sr. Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. Por otra parte, la investigación deberá también determinar el rol exacto que le cupo a ciertos individuos respecto de quienes, prima facie, se cuenta con elementos que permiten colegir que no resultan ajenos a la maniobra delictiva denunciada, entre los cabe mencionar al Ministro de Planificación Federal, Inversión Pública y Servicios de la Nación, Arquitecto Julio De Vido. Por último, corresponde a la pesquisa aquí propiciada la individualización y la determinación de la responsabilidad penal que en los hechos delictivos denunciados pudieron haber tenido todas aquellas personas -funcionarios o no- que intervinieron en la elaboración, negociación, concreción y consumación del acuerdo firmado con la República Islámica de Irán, como una de las vías para lograr la impunidad. Esto incluye tanto a aquellos cuyos roles fueron de público conocimiento, como a quienes eventualmente hayan participado sin que su intervención haya tomado estado público.  Introducción: A lo largo de esta denuncia se expondrán los elementos probatorios que dejan en evidencia la existencia de un sofisticado plan delictivo, deliberadamente ideado para encubrir y dotar de impunidad a los acusados iraníes en la causa seguida por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, con el objeto de que eludan definitivamente a la justicia argentina y se sustraigan de ella. Se verá también que, para la época en que se urdió e instrumentó el plan criminal, la urgencia energética que atravesaba y atraviesa nuestro país y el anhelo por restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal, ligados a una visión geopolítica de acercamiento con la República Islámica de Irán fueron, según las pruebas con que se cuenta, los factores determinantes para que la primera mandataria, Dra. Cristina Elisabet Fernández, con la necesaria e inestimable participación y colaboración de Héctor Timerman, tomara la aciaga decisión de llevar adelante este plan de impunidad, sacrificando la justicia en el caso AMIA. En efecto, quedará acreditado que esta confabulación criminal fue decidida por la Sra. Presidente de la Nación y puesta en funcionamiento, principalmente, por su Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Héctor Marcos Timerman. Asimismo, se probará la activa participación criminal de terceros en la maniobra, entre los que cabe mencionar a Luis Ángel D’Elía; a Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, al Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, a Fernando Esteche, al ex Fiscal designado para actuar en forma conjunta, alterna o sucesiva en la causa AMIA, Héctor Luis Yrimia y a un individuo perteneciente a la Secretaría de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación, identificado como “Alian” que, según las constancias halladas, todo indica que se trataría de Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. En ese sentido, se presentarán las pruebas que ilustran que el plan que aquí se denuncia incluyó negociaciones secretas y públicas con los iraníes, durante las cuales se acordó dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, y que dichas tratativas desembocaron en la firma de un Memorando de Entendimiento que, en su esencia, debe ser considerado como lo que realmente es: apenas uno de los medios elegidos por los aquí acusados para garantizar lo que se había acordado de antemano, esto es, la impunidad de los prófugos iraníes y su desvinculación definitiva de la causa. Como se verá en detalle durante el desarrollo de la denuncia y se adelantará unos párrafos más abajo, la firma y ratificación de tal documento implica lisa y llanamente la destrucción de las imputaciones contra los acusados de nacionalidad iraní. En primer lugar, porque las conclusiones de la llamada “Comisión de la Verdad”, como así lo revela la evidencia, ya se encontraban previamente arregladas entre los signatarios. En segunda medida, como se verificó en los hechos, debido a que el acuerdo fue la excusa que esgrimieron las partes para solicitar a Interpol que diera de baja las notificaciones rojas. En tercer término, porque su confusa y ambigua redacción y las innumerables fases sucesivas previstas, sin plazo alguno, para que sus disposiciones sean aplicadas, permite que los socios en este acuerdo de impunidad aludan indefinidamente a la existencia del Memorando, aunque en la práctica no produzca efecto legal alguno. También, se probará que el plan de impunidad pergeñado por la Sra. Presidente de la Nación incluyó un cambio de hipótesis y un redireccionamiento de la investigación judicial del caso AMIA, hacia “nuevos imputados”, fundado en pruebas falsas y destinado a desvincular definitiva y fraudulentamente a los acusados iraníes. De hecho, algunos de los aquí acusados estuvieron expresamente abocados a fabricar esta hipótesis falsa. Sabían que la “Comisión de la Verdad” no había sido creada para investigar absolutamente nada, sino para legitimar la mentira que se estaba fabricando. Se acreditará que este plan criminal también involucró acuerdos secretos, por fuera del Memorando de Entendimiento. Así, se concertó -en forma oculta- el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que pesaban y pesan sobre los funcionarios iraníes, por ser el interés cardinal de Teherán para suscribir el acuerdo. Asimismo, se probará que secretamente se había pactado que, en la práctica, el ex Ministro de Defensa iraní y actual prófugo de la justicia argentina, Ahmad Vahidi, jamás sería interrogado, a pesar de lo estipulado en el Memorando, pues así había sido convenido entre las partes: “ya había sido conversado antes”. Además, quedará evidenciado que los funcionarios involucrados en este plan criminal, ya sean argentinos o iraníes, han tenido un objetivo común. Que no se trata de dos partes negociando un acuerdo, como se lo quiso presentar públicamente, sino de dos socios buscando borrar -sin que nadie lo advierta- una imputación penal en un delito de lesa humanidad. Más aún, aquí se demostrará que los pasos y avances del plan criminal fueron comunicados en tiempo real no solo a las autoridades iraníes, sino también a uno de los prófugos de la causa AMIA, Mohsen Rabbani, quien participó de negociaciones comerciales con las autoridades argentinas involucradas en este plan e intervino en las tratativas dirigidas - fundamentalmente- a garantizar su propia impunidad. También quedará evidenciado que se lanzó una feroz campaña de descrédito hacia la investigación del caso, destinada a horadar la versión judicial de los hechos, y se la combinó con una campaña de engaño, compuesta por falacias, puestas en escena, mentiras, desmentidas, falsas promesas y la manipulación a sobrevivientes y familiares de las víctimas del atentado, a fin de evitar que la opinión pública conozca la entidad del verdadero objetivo encubridor oculto detrás del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado con Irán. Asimismo, se expondrán los elementos de prueba que acreditan que la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller efectuaron aportes en la necesaria división de tareas que implicó esta compleja maniobra delictiva. De las contribuciones concretas y específicas de la Sra. Presidente que se han podido acreditar con sólido sustento probatorio, surge con claridad que no solamente fue quien decidió la articulación de este plan criminal de impunidad, sino que, para ello, se valió de distintos actores para llevar adelante su ejecución, y en todo momento estuvo en control de la misma, ya sea impartiendo órdenes directas a sus cómplices, o bien encabezando la campaña discursiva y mediática necesaria para camuflar la perpetración del delito. Así, ha elegido a algunos de los partícipes de la maniobra delictiva, involucrando directamente a -cuanto menos- uno de sus ministros y a un legislador nacional; ha controlado la evolución del plan en cada paso; ha negociado por interpósitas personas con uno de los prófugos; y se ha involucrado personalmente en algunas acciones de ocultamiento que este sofisticado plan requería. En la misma línea, se demostrará holgadamente que el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, Héctor Timerman, ha sido - sin duda alguna- el principal instrumentador del plan de impunidad ideado y ordenado por la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fernández. Naturalmente, tratándose de un plan criminal que ha involucrado a un país extranjero, el Canciller ocupaba y ocupa el puesto clave para encargarse personalmente de muchos aspectos de este encubrimiento. Desde su función, transmitió a Irán la decisión del gobierno argentino de abandonar el reclamo de justicia en la causa AMIA; acordó la baja de las notificaciones rojas; signó acuerdos secretos con la parte iraní; participó de las negociaciones, de la redacción y de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, pieza central del plan de impunidad. Y se involucró personalmente en la campaña de descrédito y engaño, destinada a destruir la credibilidad de la causa judicial con el fin de, dolosamente, presentar al acuerdo con Irán como la única vía apta para solucionar el caso. Ambos funcionarios actuaron con un único y delictivo propósito: lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iraníes y el cese de toda actividad jurisdiccional en su contra, en pos de restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal y dar un paso hacia un acercamiento geopolítico con la República Islámica de Irán, sin soportar reproche alguno por parte de la sociedad argentina. Ello, según surge de la evidencia reunida y sin descartar en modo alguno la existencia de otros motivos adicionales a los aquí expuestos, pero que en nada modificarían o disminuirían la criminal responsabilidad de los denunciados. Quizá no resulte ocioso aclarar que nada hay de reprochable en la relación comercial o la vinculación geopolítica entre estados. La objeción surge al comprobarse, nítidamente, que dicho acercamiento implicó por parte de las autoridades del gobierno argentino aquí denunciadas, sacrificar una causa judicial en trámite, desconocer lo decidido por la justicia nacional y urdir un plan criminal para borrar de un plumazo las serias acusaciones que pesan sobre los prófugos iraníes, pretendiendo otorgarles impunidad definitiva. Algo inédito y nunca visto. No se trata de una afirmación dogmática, se aportan en esta denuncia múltiples elementos probatorios que confirman que el anhelo por el petróleo iraní fue uno de los motores de las acciones delictivas denunciadas. A modo de ejemplo puede citarse una mínima parte de la prueba descripta en este escrito, como cuando Femando Esteche, en diciembre de 2012, expresó refiriéndose al gobierno argentino: “...los tipos quieren restablecer relaciones entre los dos estados... o cuando Luis D’Elía, en mayo de 2013, agregó: “...ahí hablé con Julio [en referencia al Ministro Julio De Vido] ...acá hay urgencia energética...ellos están dispuestos a mandar a la gente de YPF a hacer negocios allá [en alusión a Irán '[...está muy interesado en cambiar lo de aquellos por granos y carne...” o, por último, cuando el agente iraní en Buenos Aires, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, confirmó “...el tema que necesita Argentina, es petróleo...hay un verdadero interés para empezar y entablar las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno, con funcionarios del gobierno de acá, una delegación de allá viajaría o a Caracas o al Golfo o a Beirut mejor ...para empezar las relaciones directas de funcionarios a funcionarios... ”. Por si ello no bastara, y aquí lo relevante, otras pruebas vienen a confirmar que el comienzo del intercambio comercial argentino-iraní estaba supeditado a la ratificación de Irán del Memorando de Entendimiento, es decir, al avance del plan de impunidad. Viene al caso destacar lo dicho por Jorge Khalil, uno de los partícipes de dicho plan: “Acá hay luz verde para hacer las operaciones...el tema es que quieren que se apure el memorándum...y se habló con De Vido...Argentina tiene una gran necesidad de petróleo e Irán tiene una gran necesidad de granos... Por otro lado, De Vido entiende que para dar un paso en esto, o sea oficial, de Estado a Estado, tiene que haber firma del Memorándum Y para sorpresa e indignación de muchos, quedará evidenciado por la prueba reunida que en estas negociaciones participó nada menos que uno de los prófugos iraníes, Mohsen Rabbani, quien recibía periódicos reportes telefónicos de los avances que ocurrían en el seno de nuestro gobierno. Para citar otro ejemplo de los tantos que constan en esta presentación, se transcribe uno de los informes telefónicos recibidos por Rabbani: “...hoy terminamos una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas... ”, a lo que Rabbani contestó: “mándeme para que evalúe” y luego de evaluarlo respondió: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina...y también comprar armas... ” Es decir, mientras la justicia nacional acusaba y acusa fundadamente a ciertos funcionarios iraníes de haber decidido, planificado y ejecutado el atentado terrorista contra la sede de la AMIA y mientras públicamente la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller aseguraban que sus acciones estaban exclusivamente motivadas en la búsqueda de justicia para la causa AMIA y que el Memorando de Entendimiento era única solución viable para el caso, uno de esos imputados, Mohsen Rabbani, secreta y clandestinamente negociaba con nuestras autoridades a través de intermediarios y canales ocultos, un intercambio de petróleo por granos, la venta de armamento, y lo que es más grave aún: su impunidad. Acaso resulte una obviedad pero no puede dejar de señalarse que las circunstancias denunciadas revisten una gravedad institucional extrema e inusitada, tanto por la jerarquía funcional de varios de los involucrados en la maniobra criminal como por la calificación legal del delito que se encubre, esto es, el “delito anterior” objeto del encubrimiento, que es, ni más ni menos, que el atentado terrorista a la sede de la AMIA, judicialmente declarado crimen de lesa humanidad y calificado de genocidio por el juez de la causa, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral. Ahora bien, para contextualizar debidamente los hechos delictivos que se denuncian, resulta útil recordar que la justicia argentina determinó que las máximas autoridades iraníes de 1994 fueron quienes tomaron la decisión de atentar contra la AMIA, diagramaron la implementación de ese ataque y encomendaron su ejecución a la organización terrorista libanesa Hezbollah. A consecuencia de ello se solicitó la captura nacional e internacional del ex Presidente de la República Islámica de Irán, Ali Akbar Hashemi Bahramaie Rafsanjani; del ex Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Ali Akbar Velayati; del ex Ministro de Inteligencia, Ali Fallahijan; del ex Jefe de la Guardia Revolucionaria, Mohsen Rezai; del ex Jefe de la Fuerza Al Quds y ex Ministro de Defensa, Ahmad Vahidi; del Ex Agregado Cultural de la Embajada iraní en Argentina, Mohsen Rabbani; del ex Tercer Secretario de la Embajada de Irán en Argentina, Ahmad Reza Asghari y del ex Embajador de la República de Irán en nuestro país, Hadi Soleimpanpour. Desde el año 2007, sobre cinco de tales imputados: Fallahijan, Rezai, Vahidi, Rabbani y Asghari pesan notificaciones rojas, es decir, la máxima prioridad de búsqueda que registra Interpol. Con apoyatura en tales imputaciones, la República Argentina ha venido reclamando por años a la República Islámica de Irán -hasta el momento, infructuosamente- la detención con fines de extradición de los acusados iraníes. En efecto, durante su presidencia, Néstor Kirchner no solo llevó el caso a la Asamblea General de la Organización de Naciones Unidas, sino que rechazó rotundamente todos los ofrecimientos de Teherán, siempre destinados a acordar una salida políticamente negociada a esta cuestión, netamente judicial. Da cuenta esta presentación de voluminosa prueba documental y de varios testimonios coincidentes -del ex Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fernández; de los ex Cancilleres, Rafael Bielsa y Jorge Taiana y del ex Vice Canciller, Roberto García Moritán- que describen los pactos propuestos por Irán y su rechazo de plano por parte del ex presidente argentino. Esa consistencia que durante años tuvo la postura oficial argentina en torno al caso AMIA, sufrió un cambio radical a partir de la decisión de la actual Presidente de avanzar en un plan encubridor que permita a los imputados iraníes eludir y sustraerse definitivamente al accionar de la justicia a efectos de facilitar, entre otros fines, un intercambio comercial a nivel estatal con la República Islámica de Irán. Dando cuenta de ello, el ex canciller Bielsa resaltó el cambio de posición del gobierno de la Dra. Fernández cuando sostuvo: ule dice a los familiares que los que comercian son las empresas y no el Estado. Me parece un argumento pelotudo, me fastidia mucho porque era un tema sagrado para Néstor ....Cuando era canciller, hablar de venderle o comprarle a Irán era casus belli ”. Así las cosas, por mucho tiempo la relación bilateral estuvo signada por la indiferencia iraní a los reclamos argentinos y, como contrapartida, por la sólida resolución de nuestro país de no avanzar en ningún frente vincular sin antes obtener cooperación por parte de Teherán, es decir, la entrega de los acusados para su juzgamiento por la justicia nacional. Se comprobará que, en este contexto histórico y con el cuadro de situación descripto, entre octubre de 2010 y enero de 2011, el gobierno argentino presidido por Cristina Fernández experimentó un giro de 180 grados en relación a su consideración del caso AMIA. Efectivamente, aquel enero de 2011, Héctor Timerman viajó a la ciudad siria de Alepo y secretamente se reunió con su par iraní, Ali Akbar Salehi, a quien le hizo saber que las autoridades políticas argentinas estaban dispuestas a renunciar a la investigación del caso AMIA y a cualquier reclamo de cooperación y justicia, con tal de provocar un acercamiento de orden geopolítico y restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales entre ambos estados. Quedará demostrado también que el Canciller Salehi tomó nota de tal ofrecimiento y se lo comunicó al entonces Presidente Ahmadinejad: “...Argentina ya no está más interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados...en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones comerciales con Irán ”. Es la primera vez que un estado agredido implora a un estado agresor que firme un acuerdo por el cual les otorgará impunidad a los agresores. De este modo, comenzó un período de negociación secreto entre los gobiernos de Argentina e Irán que se extendió hasta septiembre de 2012 y durante el cual, ambas partes realizaron gestos que, a la luz de la prueba recolectada posteriormente y analizados en forma conjunta, claramente han sido indicativos del acuerdo que, en esa época, se estaba incubando. Siempre a modo de ejemplo, dado el carácter introductorio de estos párrafos, puede citarse que el gobierno argentino, en julio de 2011, calificó de “muy positiva” una misiva de la cancillería persa por la cual se ofrecía colaborar con la investigación, curiosamente, en una nueva hipótesis, distinta a la esgrimida por la justicia. Avanzadas dichas negociaciones secretas donde se gestó el encubrimiento y el plan de impunidad de los iraníes, en el mes de septiembre de 2012, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner oficializó las reuniones, siendo que, públicamente ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, adujo que la República Islámica de Irán había expresado su voluntad de negociar por el caso AMIA. Se entienden ahora los motivos por los cuales la Sra. Presidente, en aquella oportunidad y por primera vez, no invitó a las instituciones comunitarias judías a formar parte de su comitiva a la apertura del Debate General de la citada asamblea internacional. El anuncio que haría había sido acordado con anterioridad y con una finalidad distinta a la que se invocó. Quedará aquí probado, que tal manifestación de la Sra. Presidente fue solo una puesta en escena, la primera de muchas que ocurrirían durante el camino que recorrió el plan de impunidad ideado y orquestado por los funcionarios argentinos aquí denunciados. Con este gesto, se buscó ocultar que el acercamiento había sido promovido por Argentina, y no por Irán como se dijo; y se quiso hacer creer que las negociaciones se iniciarían entonces, cuando ya llevaban -al menos- un año y medio. Así, se acreditará que mientras transcurrían las negociaciones diplomáticas públicas, el plan de impunidad avanzaba solapadamente a través de canales paralelos de comunicación y negociación con Irán, gestándose en aquel momento un aspecto fundamental del plan criminal: la desviación de la investigación hacia una nueva y falsa hipótesis que incrimine a terceros inocentes, pero -fundamentalmente- desincrimine a los iraníes, tareas de las participaron activamente Jorge Khalil, Fernando Esteche, Héctor Yrimia y el sujeto conocido como “Alian”. El resultado visible de las negociaciones, tanto secretas como públicas, fue el Memorando de Entendimiento firmado el 27 de enero de 2013 en Etiopía. La versión oficial argentina indicó que se trataba de un instrumento jurídico que permitiría avanzar con las indagatorias de los prófugos. La realidad fue que solo se trató de uno de los medios elegidos por las partes para viabilizar el plan criminal que negociaron durante dos años, pues su letra resultaba y resulta funcional a esta maniobra espuria. Que quede bien claro. El acuerdo entre representantes iraníes y las autoridades argentinas excede con creces la mera letra del memorando. El plan criminal consistió en la eliminación de las imputaciones que la justicia argentina esgrimió contra funcionarios iraníes y el mejor modo que se halló para despejar tales acusaciones, brindar impunidad y presentar el tema de la manera más prolija posible a los ojos de la ciudadanía engañada, fue la suscripción del mencionado acuerdo bilateral. Ello fue así porque su letra prevé mecanismos para lograr la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, porque su aplicación contiene tantas etapas sucesivas sin plazo alguno que permite prolongar indefinidamente su vigencia en el tiempo sin lograr avances reales, porque las conclusiones de la “Comisión de la Verdad” ya estaban arregladas de antemano y su actuación permite la introducción de la nueva hipótesis falsa, armada con pruebas inventadas. En efecto, como se verá, en la práctica, las únicas trabas a la impunidad de hecho de la que gozan los acusados iraníes han sido las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, que tienen la capacidad de dificultar su movilidad trasnacional. Por ello, las partes acordaron hacerlas cesar. De allí que el punto 7 del Memorando tenga su razón de ser. Trátase del único punto que debía tener aplicación inmediata, del único que tiene carácter operativo sin necesidad de que el acuerdo haya sido ratificado. Redactado en esos términos, carece de toda explicación lógica. Se advierte, entonces, que la baja de las notificaciones rojas fue el primer y trascendental paso acordado secretamente entre Salehi y Timerman hacia la desvinculación definitiva de los imputados. Nótese que, al mes de haberse firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, el agente de inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación “Alian” le comunicó al operador iraní Khalil, “Tengo un chisme...me dijeron ahí en 'la casa' [en referencia a la Secretaría de Inteligencia]...Interpol va a levantar el pedido de capturas de los amigos [en alusión a los prófugos iraníes]...lo va a levantar ahora”. En forma sorpresiva e inesperada para los encubridores, Interpol advirtió que se lo quiso involucrar donde nada tenía que hacer e intercedió a tiempo para evitar la baja de las prioridades de búsqueda. Se verá cómo esa intervención se erigió en un obstáculo inesperado para los autores del encubrimiento. Timerman no pudo cumplir lo que había prometido en sus negociaciones secretas con Irán, circunstancia que motivó la queja de los iraníes. Repárese, además, que desde que Interpol comunicó que las notificaciones rojas contra los acusados por el caso AMIA seguirían vigentes, la República Islámica de Irán retiró el acuerdo de su agenda parlamentaria y hasta el momento en que se formula esta presentación, no ha comunicado oficialmente su aprobación interna. El motivo de semejante vuelta atrás surge nítido de las pruebas que se presentarán. El agente persa Khalil, al día siguiente de regresar de Irán, comunicó a las autoridades argentinas la razón de la tardanza, ante el reclamo local por la demora de Teherán en la aprobación interna de Memorando de Entendimiento: “...De Vido tiene que saber que Timerman no cumplió con algunas cosas. Esto es así de claro. No cumplió con algunas cosas...” y en otra oportunidad, expresó: “...meparece que el ruso este de mierda [en alusión a Héctor Timerman] se mandó alguna...estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares [en referencia a las notificaciones rojas]... ”. Más allá de los ejemplos relatados, lo que se pretende dejar aquí en blanco sobre negro son dos conclusiones reveladoras que se desprenden de estos dichos, como de otras probanzas que también se analizarán. La primera radica en la certidumbre sobre la existencia de una promesa por parte del canciller Timerman para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas. Timerman no cumplió, no porque no haya querido, sino porque Interpol se lo impidió. Incluso, podrá apreciarse en esta denuncia que el Canciller volvió a la carga en los meses de septiembre y noviembre de 2013, con claras intenciones de convencer a Ronald Noble para que ceda y autorice el cese de las notificaciones rojas, bajo el argumento que el acuerdo entre las partes siguió avanzando, pero -por fortuna- tampoco entonces pudo lograr su cometido. La segunda conclusión que se desprende de aquella conversación transmite la certeza de que, además del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado, han existido entre las partes otros acuerdos secretos. Corrobora tal afirmación, entre otras evidencias, el testimonio del propio Salehi, quien reconoció sin ambages: “Interpol debe eliminar las acusaciones contra las autoridades iraníes ....El [contenido] del acuerdo entre Irán y Argentina en relación con la cuestión AMIA será hecho público en el momento adecuado y la cuestión [de los imputados iraníes] está incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo...”. Habiendo sido realizada esta declaración en el mes de marzo de 2013, resulta evidente que Salehi no se estaba refiriendo al Memorando de Entendimiento sino a otro convenio que a esa fecha aún no se había dado a conocer. Y en este marco deben entenderse también las manifestaciones de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, cuando comentando noticias periodísticas que difundían que el ex Ministro de Defensa iraní, Ahmad Vahidi, nunca sería interrogado pese a estar incluido en el Memorando, aseguró que el rumor era cierto, que ese tema en particular “estaba conversado antes....estaba dentro del marco ” y que el acuerdo era “más profundo todavía ”. Es decir, quedará probado que el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, Héctor Timerman no solo firmó un Memorando de Entendimiento abiertamente inconstitucional, que además garantiza la impunidad de los acusados iraníes, sino que también cerró acuerdos secretos mucho más beneficiosos para los prófugos. De allí que se compruebe que no se trató, como se presentó públicamente, de dos partes que negociaron un acuerdo bilateral, sino que fueron dos socios que confeccionaron un sofisticado plan criminal de impunidad para desligar definitivamente a los prófugos de la causa AMIA de toda relación con el atentado y cerrar toda investigación respecto de ellos. De hecho, luego de suscribirse el acuerdo, el agente argentino “Alian” le confesó a su par de Irán: “...Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me tenías fe...”, dejando en evidencia que ambas partes han tenido el mismo objetivo criminal. Ahora bien, surge de la evidencia detallada en la denuncia, que la oportuna intervención de Interpol manteniendo vigentes las notificaciones rojas no frustró ni imposibilitó a futuro el encubrimiento orquestado. Los autores habían tenido la precaución de idear mecanismos alternativos para conseguir sus fines, contenidos en la letra del Memorando de Entendimiento. Se advertirá sobre los numerosísimos mecanismos previstos en el intrincado acuerdo bilateral. Naturalmente ello no ha sido fruto de la incompetencia de los redactores sino, todo lo contrario, de su sagacidad para dotar al Memorando de un enmarañado proceso de aplicación que exige, para que un imputado iraní se siente a escuchar los cargos de la justicia argentina, la verificación de una larguísima serie de procedimientos, alguno de ellos de imposible cumplimiento, atento a la incompatibilidad con sus respectivas legislaciones:	1) que ambos países ratifiquen internamente los términos del acuerdo; 2) que se remitan mutuamente las notas reversales notificando dicha ratificación; 3) que cada uno de los signatarios proceda a la elección de personas de reconocida trayectoria jurídica y probidad personal para que integren la “Comisión de la Verdad”; 4) que los elegidos acepten la designación; 5) que entre ambas partes y de común acuerdo, seleccionen un quinto miembro de la comisión; 6) que los miembros de la Comisión redacten las reglas del procedimiento al que se sujetarán; 7) que se pida información de la causa; 8) que se envíe la información requerida y se la traduzca; 9) que cada uno de los miembros de la comisión analice las pruebas remitidas; 10) que se reúnan para emitir recomendaciones; 11) que se notifiquen dichas recomendaciones a los signatarios; 12) que se establezca una fecha para cumplir con audiencias; 13) que se cite a los imputados; 14) que éstos efectivamente comparezcan a un interrogatorio, que no reúne -como se verá- las condiciones mínimas para ser considerado una declaración indagatoria válida para el derecho argentino. Ninguno de estos pasos tiene plazo determinado para ser cumplido. Tan es así, que ha pasado más de un año y medio desde la firma del Memorando y todavía no se concluyó siquiera el primer escalón. Irán aún no ha comunicado la ratificación del acuerdo. Puede verse con claridad que los términos de este pacto, reflejo de una actividad criminal subyacente, están redactados de modo tal que muy sencillamente se puede demorar en forma indefinda su cumplimiento. Otra llave que conduce a la impunidad definitiva es la efectiva actuación de la “Comisión de la Verdad” cuya finalidad consiste en - llegado el momento- recibir y valorar nuevas pruebas y presentar una nueva hipótesis sin iraníes como acusados, legitimando el redireccionamiento de la pesquisa. La comisión evaluará una nueva verdad falsa, una verdad armada artificialmente por los inescrupulosos artífices de este siniestro plan. Nuevamente, prueba directa sostiene lo afirmado. El agente iraní Jorge Khalil, el mismo día de la firma del Memorando, expresó: “...alguien va a salir con la cara manchada de acá...” y ciertamente estaba seguro que no sería el país al que sirve porque “...Obvio, eso ya está arreglado... ¿Cómo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo? Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa... ”. En ese sentido se demostrará, con pruebas categóricas, que una vez firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento comenzó una relación de apoyo y protección del gobierno argentino a los referentes iraníes apostados en Buenos Aires que, conscientes de ello, afirmaron “el gobierno ahora está a favor""\ “...el gobierno banca...” y el propio Khalil reconoció: “...Nosotros estamos ante un acuerdo con el gobierno nacional ...atrás de una negociación con el gobierno nacional...”. En otro pasaje de la denuncia quedará demostrado que autores y cómplices, como parte integral del plan criminal, ya habían planificado y avanzado en la fabricación de una hipótesis acusatoria falsa, con pruebas inventadas para redireccionar la pesquisa hacia terceros inocentes y así desligar definitivamente a los nacionales iraníes. En referencia a dicha desincriminación fraudulenta, en una fecha tan temprana como diciembre de 2012, Esteche aseveró: “quieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla... Y de la conversación se desprende que esa tarea quedó a cargo de funcionarios de la Secretaría de Inteligencia, especialmente designados para ello. Es decir, en una época en que ni la justicia ni los familiares sabían qué estaba ocurriendo con la negociación entre Argentina e Irán, los partícipes del encubrimiento conocían perfectamente que se venía un cambio de hipótesis y el redireccionamiento de la investigación hacia nuevos imputados. Esto era así, pues ellos mismos eran justamente los encargados de armar la falsa acusación. Así se explican las palabras de “Alian” cuando afirmó “...estamos en otro país, es otra situación mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...''’' y “...va a venir otra hipótesis con otras pruebas...” que iban a descolocar al suscripto como Fiscal de la causa “porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas ...lo que viene ahora Sin importar las evidencias, los hechos o su verdadera responsabilidad en el atentado, los ciudadanos iraníes iban a ser desvinculados de la causa, se le iba a “lavar la cara” a Irán y ello estaba cerrado “muy arriba”, es decir tenía el sello presidencial. Todo había sido acordado, se iba a utilizar el caso AMIA como una pieza para saciar intereses geopolíticos en el nuevo tablero internacional. Casi con ironía, al suscribir el acuerdo, el canciller emitió un comunicado que rezaba: “...El gobierno nacional ratifica que el único compromiso es con las víctimas y el derecho de sus familiares a hallar en la verdad y en la justicia la reparación debida. Argentina reafirma que en dicho objetivo no hay lugar para intereses geopolíticos, ni propios, ni ajenos... ”. Las pruebas aquí obtenidas revelan que esto no era cierto y que intereses comerciales y geopolíticos motorizaron un plan secreto de impunidad, que nada tiene que ver con la búsqueda de justicia. Por otra parte, resulta oportuno destacar también la tranquilidad con que actuaron todos los partícipes del plan de impunidad, en particular el individuo conocido como “Alian”, que se ha venido desenvolviendo libremente sin considerar necesario actuar de modo encubierto, ni siquiera ante la extrema sensibilidad del asunto que llevaba adelante. Ello se ha debido simplemente a la circunstancia de que ha actuado por órdenes superiores, por directivas expresas de la Presidente de la Nación, razón por la cual no ha tenido que preocuparse por camuflar sus actividades. “Alian”, en primera persona, confesó esa máxima garantía. La redirección de la investigación y el desprestigio de las autoridades judiciales a cargo de la investigación tenían el sello presidencial “tranquilo, está cerrado muy arriba Además, conforme podrá apreciarse con mayor claridad en el desarrollo de las páginas correspondientes, se verá que tanto la Sra. Presidente como su Canciller contribuyeron en forma personal al perfeccionamiento del plan criminal. Ambos se involucraron en una campaña política y mediática pretendiendo instalar, entre otras falsas cuestiones, la idea de que la causa por el atentado a la AMIA estaba paralizada prácticamente desde que se inició. Quedará expuesto con sumo detalle el modo en que la Dra. Fernández y el Sr. Timerman han manipulado a sobrevivientes, a familiares de las víctimas del atentado y a instituciones judías comunitarias, desplegando una completa artillería de mentiras, falacias y engaños que tienen su ejemplo emblemático en la promesa presidencial, flagrantemente incumplida, que aseguró una consulta con familiares y víctimas, previo a la aceptación de cualquier propuesta por parte de Irán. Recuérdese que, en septiembre de 2012, la primera mandataria expresó: “...tengan la certeza de que esta Presidenta no va a tomar ninguna resolución respecto de ninguna propuesta que le sea formulada, sin consultar PREVIAMENTE con quienes han sido las víctimas directas de esto. Y, al mismo tiempo también, con las fuerzas políticas con representación parlamentaria en mi país, porque esto no puede decidir una sola fuerza política.. La realidad fue cruda. Se engañó a los familiares y a las víctimas del atentado ya que, contrario a lo prometido, jamás se los consultó. Es más, debieron enterarse de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento con la República Islámica de Irán por los medios de comunicación. Tampoco fueron escuchados cuando expresaron mayoritariamente su rechazo a la ratificación del acuerdo por parte del Congreso Nacional. Quedó claro, entonces, que dijeran lo que dijeran los familiares la decisión estaba tomada. El Memorando había sido firmado para garantizar un objetivo oculto: dotar de impunidad a los acusados iraníes y permitir al gobierno argentino justificar ante sus ciudadanos y la comunidad internacional el restablecimiento de las relaciones comerciales y el alineamiento con Teherán. Por ello, el acuerdo debía ser aprobado a cualquier costo, porque despejaba el único escollo que existía para asociarse con Irán. Era estrictamente necesario para la consecución del plan criminal pergeñado. Vaya ironía. Una Presidente que públicamente se ha regodeado manifestando a los sobrevivientes y a los familiares de las víctimas su compromiso en la búsqueda de verdad y justicia, que ha declarado que su gobierno no permitirá que se use el caso AMIA en el ajedrez de la geopolítica mundial, que ha tomado cartas en el asunto porque la causa estaba paralizada; fue, en realidad, la principal artífice, junto con el Canciller Timerman, de la fraudulenta desarticulación de la investigación y del encubrimiento de estos acusados. En el discurso se habló de justicia y verdad. En los hechos se acordó impunidad. Pasmoso. Da pavor, entonces, constatar que todo se ha tratado de actuación y manipulación de hechos y personas y, más aún, de acciones delictivas. También se acreditará que la reunión del 28 de septiembre de 2012	entre los cancilleres de ambos países, fue una puesta en escena previamente pautada y, en realidad, gestada a pedido de Cristina Fernández para engañar a la opinión pública argentina. Mientras días atrás, la Presidente había exhortado con firmeza, ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, al flamante presidente iraní Hassan Rohani para que avance con la implementación del pacto; por lo bajo y a través de los canales paralelos de negociación que se desarrollaron para llevar adelante este plan criminal, la Dra. Cristina Fernández entabló comunicaciones con altos mandos iraníes y con el mismo Mohsen Rabbani. El mensajero argentino Luis D’Elía especificó el pedido: “...tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar allá urgente [en referencia a Irán], antes de mañana...Estoy en la casa de gobierno ahora...no hay asunto más importante que este, créemelo ....necesito que hables con el Sheik de allá [en referencia a Rabbani] mira que es muy groso lo que tengo eh!..”. La Sra. Presidente buscaba obtener ciertos pronunciamientos públicos por parte de Teherán, aunque fueran falsos porque serían funcionales al plan de impunidad, siempre con el objeto de avanzar en su objetivo último: el acercamiento comercial y geopolítico con Irán. El receptor del mensaje de D’Elía y transmisor a Irán, Jorge Khalil, reveló la información al expresar: “...Necesitan que el gobierno iraní junto con el gobierno argentino mañana anuncie la conformación de la Comisión de la Verdad...”. Así se adelanta lo que quedará demostrado en este punto: el interés imperioso de los encubridores en realizar nuevos aportes al plan, la existencia de canales de comunicación y negociación paralelos a los oficiales y ocultos a la opinión pública, la evidencia flagrante de que los detalles sobre el plan criminal se arreglaron en secreto por tales canales y que las manifestaciones públicas de la Presidente y el Canciller han sido solo maquillaje mediático para engañar a la ciudadanía respecto a la real situación del caso AMIA. Finalmente, quedará demostrado que este sofisticado plan, como se expuso al inicio, fue ejecutado por un conjunto de cómplices. En primer lugar, corresponde mencionar a Luis D’Elía, desde siempre un acérrimo defensor tanto del régimen iraní como del gobierno nacional, al punto de calificarse a sí mismo como “un soldado” incondicional de la Presidente: “ ...Yo tengo que hacer el juego de la Rosada...Si tengo orden de no ir, soy un soldado acá...”. Funcionó como el interlocutor oculto de las autoridades gubernamentales argentinas y operó como transmisor y receptor de los mensajes clandestinos a la contraparte iraní, destinado a remover los obstáculos que iba presentando el avance del encubrimiento. Su voz ha sido la del gobierno nacional. Sus antecedentes lo avalaban para ocupar esa función. Consustanciado ideológicamente con ambas partes del pacto delictivo, estuvo varias veces en Irán invitado por el régimen y en una ocasión, le ofrecieron un acuerdo similar al que luego firmó Timerman, que ya incluía el cese de las notificaciones rojas. En todas sus visitas a Irán, se entrevistó con las máximas autoridades, se fotografió -entre otros- con el prófugo Mohsen Rabbani, con quien está relacionado hace años. Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil es el referente más importante de las autoridades del régimen iraní en Argentina, incluso por encima del ex Encargado de Negocios de Irán en nuestro país, sobre quien -como luego se verá- tenía más poder. Militante a tiempo completo de los intereses persas, es la “voz y oídos de Irán” en Argentina. En ese carácter, ha funcionado como el nexo central en la vinculación entre funcionarios iraníes y argentinos en el marco de los hechos denunciados, operando -de ese modo- como el referente de la diplomacia paralela que comunica Buenos Aires con Teherán, que fue aprovechada para la consecución del plan de impunidad. Participó tanto del armado de la pista falsa, como de las tratativas con el gobierno argentino relativas a los intercambios comerciales que se pretendían establecer con Irán a nivel estatal. Y mantuvo constantemente informado de cada avance del plan al prófugo Mohsen Rabbani. Femando Esteche, es el líder de la agrupación Quebracho, muy cercano a algunos funcionarios del gobierno nacional y que desde antaño ha mantenido una postura favorable a los intereses iraníes, tanto que ha sido sostenido económicamente por dicho régimen. Su intervención ha sido determinante pues se trata de uno de los sujetos que viabilizó el avance del plan de encubrimiento, acercando al agente iraní Khalil a los funcionarios de inteligencia argentinos, y en especial, al ex Fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA, Héctor Yrimia, además de haber aportado ideas concretas para la construcción de la nueva hipótesis falsa. El Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque también ha sido un actor clave en la articulación del plan criminal pues, dada su cercanía tanto con la Presidente de la Nación como con los partícipes del encubrimiento ha operado como nexo e intermediario de la información transmitida entre autores y cómplices del encubrimiento. Se probarán distintos episodios en los que Larroque bajó directivas presidenciales, tanto a Khalil como a D'Elía, sobre cómo debían actuar. Como por ejemplo, la ocasión en que, en noviembre de 2012, Khalil reconoció: “...vengo de La Matanza recién he tenido una reunión con Luis D'Elía y el “Cuervo” Larroque, el de la Cámpora...que me llamaron temprano que querían hablar conmigo, que tenían un mensaje para el gobierno para dar... Y ahora me voy para Martínez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador...”. Su intervención ha resultado indispensable en la ingeniería criminal para evitar el contacto directo entre autores y ejecutores del plan de impunidad. El Dr. Héctor Yrimia, entonces Fiscal de Primera Instancia en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal, fue designado el día del atentado junto a otros fiscales para actuar en forma conjunta, alterna o sucesiva en el caso AMIA. De allí que haya conocido en detalle los hechos materia de investigación. En consecuencia, estuvo en contacto con pruebas, testimonios, peritajes e informes de la causa y -justamente- este minucioso grado de cognición lo ha tornado fundamental para el buen desarrollo del plan. Su aporte fue realizado donde resultó más útil: en el armado de una hipótesis falsa donde, valiéndose de la información obtenida en ejercicio de la función pública, ha cooperado con dicha fase del plan. Una mención aparte merece el sujeto conocido como “Alian”, que responde a la Secretaría de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación. Se trata de una persona con acceso al entorno presidencial, que cuenta con información privilegiada -incluso sobre la salud de la Sra. Presidente- y que ha declarado su simpatía con el régimen iraní, que ha actuado -en reiteradas ocasiones- a favor de intereses extranjeros en detrimento de los nacionales. Que ha transmitido informaciones secretas y protegidas por la ley de inteligencia a agentes de una potencia extranjera y en quien la Sra. Presidente ha confiado para llevar adelante parte del plan de impunidad por su dedicación, obediencia, pero -sobre todo- por su falta de escrúpulos a la hora de manipular pruebas y personas para la consecución del designio ilegal que le fuera encomendado por su jefa. Efectivamente, quedará ampliamente explicado y comprobado, que los partícipes del encubrimiento, en especial el nombrado “Alian”, junto al ex Fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA y ex Juez de Instrucción, Dr. Héctor Yrimia, han trabajado y negociado la impunidad de los prófugos de la causa AMIA, transmitiendo para ello información sensible y clasificada a la contraparte iraní, contribuyendo al armado de una pista falsa, con pruebas inventadas, conspirando contra la investigación judicial e incluso utilizando los resortes del Estado Nacional para allanar cualquier obstáculo que surgiera durante la ejecución del plan de encubrimiento. En fin, los hechos que aquí se relataron, en brevísima síntesis, constituyen la concreción de un sofisticado plan de encubrimiento para dotar de impunidad a los acusados iraníes por la causa AMIA, que fue decidido por la Sra. Presidente Cristina Fernández, e instrumentado - principalmente- por su canciller Héctor Timerman, con la colaboración de personajes que, por sus cualidades y conocimientos, resultaron ideales para llevar a cabo la maniobra criminal. La paradójica y por cierto irritante circunstancia de este entramado delictivo fue que los autores del plan, para lograr sus objetivos criminales, al mismo tiempo que clamaban públicamente que solo buscaban verdad y justicia, no trepidaron en buscar destruir la imputación de la justicia argentina a expensas de 85 muertes.  I.	- Aclaración previa sobre la prueba: Los elementos probatorios que sirven de sustento para radicar la presente denuncia son, algunos de ellos, de acceso público. Sin embargo, otros, han llegado a conocimiento del suscripto en el ejercicio de su función y en el marco de la investigación del atentado perpetrado contra la sede de la AMIA. Se tratan, estos últimos, del producto de intervenciones telefónicas dispuestas judicialmente en la causa AMIA, con anterioridad incluso al comienzo de las negociaciones espurias. Inicialmente, siempre en el marco de la pesquisa por el atentado, pruebas, indicios y circunstancias fueron hallados o conocidos en forma aislada, independientes unos de otros, de forma tal que nada revelaban respecto del sustrato delictivo que, hoy ya se advierte, tienen en común. Sin embargo, el paso del tiempo y -fundamentalmente- la aparición de nuevos elementos, insoslayables por la criminalidad que exponen, hicieron que cobrara forma y solidez la sospecha sobre la existencia del plan delictivo aquí acreditado, toda vez que las evidencias obtenidas, observadas integralmente, permiten revelar una gravísima actividad delictiva. Las graves irregularidades y delitos que fueron surgiendo de las intervenciones telefónicas analizadas se tornaron cada vez más evidentes. Quedó claro que las conversaciones mantenidas por los imputados tenían su correspondiente correlato en la realidad. Los partícipes anticipaban lo que iba ocurriendo. Así comenzó a develarse el entramado criminal que aquí se denuncia y muchas de las dudas que surgían de la actuación del gobierno argentino, por ejemplo, los términos en que había sido redactado y firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, encontraron su explicación en el producido de las escuchas judiciales. Tal como un rompecabezas que va adquiriendo forma al colocarle nuevas piezas, el plan de encubrimiento fue hallando su foco, las fases del “iter criminis” fueron tornándose más nítidas y fue posible desentrañar, al menos, una parte de esta sofisticada maniobra. No debe caerse en la simplificación o la ingenuidad de que esta presentación abarca todos los elementos del plan criminal de impunidad. En rigor de verdad, lo que se vislumbra, por grave que sea, resulta ser -apenas- la punta del iceberg. Al respecto, se advierte que los aspectos más delicados de la planificación del delito no fueron comentados vía telefónica sino convenidos personalmente, por lo que la rápida actividad jurisdiccional para reconstruir históricamente lo sucedido, resulta, en este caso, fundamental. En consecuencia, corresponde afirmar que lo denunciado, ya de una gravedad institucional inusitada, es tan solo una pequeña parte de la trama y de las conductas ilícitas llevadas adelante. Será el Magistrado instructor quien deberá determinar hasta dónde se extiende en su real dimensión este plan de encubrimiento e impunidad. Por otra parte, cabe destacar que circunstancias y referencias que surgen de las comunicaciones registradas han podido ser corroboradas, ya sea porque tomaron estado público o bien, porque se condicen con hechos o manifestaciones posteriores que también han trascendido al conocimiento de todos. En otras palabras, referencias, circunstancias, fechas, episodios, posicionamientos políticos, es decir, un conjunto heterogéneo de cuestiones mencionadas en los intercambios telefónicos que aquí se reproducen, han tenido correlato en la realidad y ello redunda en la verosimilitud de las conversaciones registradas.

Estos son solo algunos pocos ejemplos de las abundantes y variadas referencias que surgen de las escuchas judiciales, que se condicen con hechos de la realidad. Dicho de otro modo, existe una correlación entre la realidad y las cuestiones que se mencionan en estos intercambios, lo que fortalece la calidad probatoria de este material y le otorga la necesaria contundencia, dado el tenor de la maniobra que se denuncia. En consecuencia, y	en virtud de la	inusitada importancia de los hechos	denunciados y sin	perjuicio de	posteriores presentaciones ampliatorias, corresponde no solo radicar la presente denuncia sino requerir una inmediata y urgente investigación de hechos que, como el presente, poseen una gravedad institucional poca veces vista.  II.	- Antecedentes a)	La acusación judicial a funcionarios iraníes en la causa AMIA El 18 de julio de	1994, aproximadamente a las 9.53 de la mañana,	una camioneta Renault	Trafic cargada	con una cantidad estimada - en su equivalente en T.N.T.- entre 300 y 400 kgs. de un compuesto de nitrato de amonio, aluminio, un hidrocarburo pesado, T.N.T. y nitroglicerina, explotó frente al edificio de la calle Pasteur 633, donde tenían su sede, entre otras instituciones, la Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) y la Delegación de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentinas (DAIA). El hecho provocó la muerte de ochenta y cinco personas, lesiones de distinta gravedad en al menos ciento cincuenta y una, y cuantiosos daños materiales. Sin perjuicio de lo ocurrido en los primeros años de la pesquisa, con fecha 25 de octubre de 2006, el suscripto emitió un dictamen en el que se acusó a un ciudadano libanés y a siete ciudadanos iraníes, - todos ellos, altos funcionarios del entonces gobierno persa-, por su participación en el atentado del 18 de julio de 1994 (fs. 122.333/122.738 de los autos principales ). El 9 de noviembre de 2006, el Sr. Juez de la causa, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, dispuso librar órdenes de captura nacional e internacional para dar con nueve imputados (un libanés y ocho iraníes)“, con miras a su extradición y a fin de recibirles declaración indagatoria en la causa (fs. 122.775/122.800). Consecuentemente, INTERPOL Buenos Aires confeccionó y remitió a sus similares las correspondientes notificaciones rojas. Por su parte, la justicia argentina, al comprobar que los sujetos buscados no habían comparecido, el Io de diciembre de 2006, los declaró rebeldes. Las órdenes de captura dictadas por el juez Canicoba Corral a instancias de esta Fiscalía, fueron cuestionadas por la Oficina Central Nacional Teherán (OCN Teherán). La Secretaría General de INTERPOL invitó a las partes a una reunión programada para el mes de enero de 2007. El 22 de aquel mes la delegación argentina, encabezada por el suscripto, realizó una presentación ante dicha Secretaría General en la cual expuso pormenorizada y detalladamente las razones y argumentos que justificaban una nueva inscripción de las notificaciones rojas relativas a las órdenes de captura internacional dispuestas en la causa. Puntualmente se explicó que los nuevos pedidos de captura estaban fundados en una decisión judicial de un estado soberano, basados en nuevas probanzas y que respetaban los requisitos fijados por INTERPOL para la inscripción de medidas de tal naturaleza, exhortando a las autoridades de la organización a que, en forma inmediata, dispusieran la búsqueda y detención de quienes se encontraban sospechados de haber tenido participación en el mayor atentado terrorista en la historia de nuestro país. La Secretaría General de INTERPOL, tras escuchar también los argumentos de la delegación iraní, dispuso que el asunto fuera tratado por el Comité Ejecutivo del organismo a la vez que encomendó a la Oficina de Asuntos Legales la confección de un dictamen sobre la cuestión debatida. Dicha oficina efectuó una saludable distinción entre las solicitudes de detención de ciudadanos iraníes formuladas por el ex juez Galeano (a las que denominó AMIA I) y las órdenes de capturas libradas en noviembre de 2006 por el Dr. Canicoba Corral (a las que llamó AMIA II) recomendando que, sobre cinco de las ocho personas acusadas, se acceda a la solicitud de publicar las notificaciones rojas. La situación de quienes, al momento del hecho, desempeñaban los cargos de Presidente y Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de la República Islámica de Irán, fue considerada similar a la analizada por el Tribunal Internacional de Justicia en el caso: “República Democrática del Congo vs. Bélgica” y las notificaciones rojas quedaron excluidas. Tampoco se emitió notificación roja respecto del exembajador iraní en Argentina, Hadi Soleimanpour. Además, sobre la presentación que formuló el suscripto en la sede de INTERPOL, su Secretario General, Sr. Ronald Noble, sostuvo: “...la altamente profesional explicación de su caso, acusado por acusado, proporcionada por los fiscales argentinos que intervienen en la causa fue importante en la conclusión de la Oficina de Asuntos Jurídicos de que el caso del pedido de ¡as notificaciones rojas por parte de la OCN Buenos Aires no revestía un carácter político predominante como para que entrara en vigor la prohibición del artículo 3.. ” En el mes de marzo de 2007 tuvo lugar la reunión del Comité Ejecutivo del INTERPOL que debía decidir esta materia (Sudáfrica, Chile, Singapur, Italia, Argelia, Estados Unidos, Corea, España, Marruecos, Brasil, India, Rusia y Alemania). Nuevamente una delegación argentina viajó a la ciudad de Lyon, República de Francia. El día 14 de ese mes, quien firma ésta presentación expuso su postura ante los miembros del Comité Ejecutivo reunidos a tal efecto en la sede central de INTERPOL. Finalizado el alegato, algunos miembros formularon consultas relativas al caso, que fueron respondidas. Seguidamente la delegación iraní hizo lo propio. Finalmente, ambas delegaciones fueron convocadas a la sala de sesiones donde el señor Presidente del Comité Ejecutivo anunció que, tras realizar un cuidadoso estudio de las presentaciones tanto escritas como orales, efectuadas por ambas delegaciones, se llegó a una decisión unánime, consistente en ratificar y hacer suya la recomendación efectuada por el señor Secretario General de la Organización tras la reunión del 22 de enero de 2007, y en consecuencia, disponer la publicación de las notificaciones rojas respecto de Imad Fayez Moughnieh, Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rabbani, Ahmad Asghari, Ahmad Vahidi y Mohsen Rezai y rechazar la solicitud de Ali Rafsanjani, Ali Velayati y Hadi Soleimapour (éste último sólo solicitado por el Sr. Juez Canicoba Corral). Se informó además que la inscripción de las notificaciones rojas ordenadas por el Comité Ejecutivo tendría lugar a partir del 31 de marzo de 2007, salvo que mediara recurso de apelación por parte de alguna de las OCN involucradas en la controversia, en cuyo caso el asunto sería remitido a consideración de la Asamblea General de la organización que se reuniría en el Reino de Marruecos en el mes de noviembre de 2007. El 22 de marzo de 2007 esta Unidad Fiscal fue notificada que la OCN Teherán había formalmente apelado la decisión del Comité Ejecutivo solicitando que la cuestión fuera planteada ante la Asamblea General, lo que recibió acogida favorable por parte de las autoridades del organismo policial internacional, incluyendo este asunto en el orden del día de la aludida reunión de referida asamblea. Como en las anteriores ocasiones, se entendió conveniente la asistencia del titular y el coordinador general de la Unidad Fiscal, así como integrantes de la OCN Buenos Aires, a la 76a Reunión Anual de la Asamblea General de INTERPOL celebrada en la ciudad de Marrakech, Reino de Marruecos, donde se decidiría el curso de cinco nuevas notificaciones rojas ordenadas en estas actuaciones. El 16 de octubre de 2007 se recibió la comunicación, por parte de la Secretaría General del Organismo Internacional de Policía, del orden del día a tratarse durante la reunión anual. El punto 8 c) tenía previsto resolver el litigio entre Irán y Argentina por la publicación de notificaciones rojas, en razón del recurso presentado por la República Islámica contra la decisión adoptada por el Comité Ejecutivo en marzo de 2007. Pero en forma previa al inicio de las deliberaciones de la Asamblea General, el Comité Ejecutivo del Organismo debió sesionar durante los días 3 y 4 de noviembre de 2007 a raíz del pedido efectuado por la delegación iraní de postergar para el año siguiente el tratamiento de la cuestión. El Comité Ejecutivo rechazó la propuesta de aplazamiento y habilitó a la Asamblea General para tratar el asunto. El día 7 de noviembre de 2007 lo inherente a la inscripción de las notificaciones rojas fue sometido a debate y posterior votación de la ALBERTO NISMAM Ministerio Público de /a Nación	fiscal general Asamblea General de Interpol. En esa oportunidad, luego que uno de los delegados de la parte iraní expusiera su postura ante las representaciones presentes, el suscripto en representación de la delegación argentina rebatió tales alegaciones y brindó los fundamentos que justificaban que sin demora se inscribieran las notificaciones rojas. Finalizadas las exposiciones, las misiones presentes votaron. La posición argentina fue aprobada por 78 votos a favor, 14 en contra y 26 abstenciones. De acuerdo a ello, el órgano rector de la Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal dio pleno aval a la postura propiciada por la delegación argentina y como consecuencia ordenó la inscripción en carácter de notificación roja de los pedidos de captura librados contra los ciudadanos iraníes Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rezai, Ahmad Vahidi, Mohsen Rabbani y Ahmad Reza Asghari, que se sumaron así al ya vigente del libanés Imad Fayez Moughnieh. El 13 de noviembre de 2007 se recibió en el sumario la comunicación formal de Interpol acerca de la efectiva inscripción de tales órdenes de captura. Así, había culminado con éxito un largo e intrincado proceso, que, dadas las vicisitudes del sumario, significó un importante avance con miras al esclarecimiento del hecho. Por ello, la gestión de la Unidad Fiscal a cargo del suscripto logró, por un amplio margen, la publicación definitiva de las notificaciones rojas respecto de los sospechados en la causa, que no sólo implicó -en ese momento- la confirmación del enderezamiento y avance de la investigación, sino también el restablecimiento de la confianza de la comunidad internacional de naciones en la actividad, probidad y eficiencia de la justicia argentina que, en relación a este caso, se había visto seriamente dañada por el proceder del anterior juez. A partir de ello y durante los siguientes años, la República Argentina reclamó a Irán, mediante distintos medios y en distintos foros internacionales, su falta de cooperación con la investigación y su renuencia a extraditar a los acusados. Por su parte, Irán nunca cedió ante los reclamos ni aceptó ninguna de las alternativas que ofreció Argentina para someter a proceso judicial a los imputados iraníes. Hasta que, al menos públicamente, en septiembre de 2012, la Sra. Presidente de la Nación, Cristina Fernández, anunció ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, haber instruido a su Canciller, Héctor Timerman para que inicie un proceso de negociación con Irán en tomo al caso AMIA. De acuerdo a la versión oficial, el Ministro Timerman se reunió por primera vez para tratar este tema con el canciller iraní Ali Akbar Salehi el día 27 de septiembre de 2012. Oficialmente, se comunicaron una serie de encuentros entre representantes de ambos países, sobre los que no se brindaron mayores detalles (Comunicados de Prensa del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de fecha 27/9/12 - N° 313/12; 29/10/12 -N° 353/12-; 31/10/12 — N° 360/12-; 1/12/12 - N° 391/12; 7/1/13 - N° 002/13-). Exactamente cuatro meses más tarde y después de tres reuniones en Suiza, con fecha 27 de enero de 2013, ambos cancilleres coincidieron en Etiopía, donde suscribieron el ’'''Memorándum de Entendimiento entre el Gobierno de la República Argentina y el Gobierno de la República Islámica de Irán sobre los temas vinculados al ataque terrorista a la sede de la AMIA en Buenos Aires el 18 de julio de 1994” (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N°011/13, 27/01/2013). El día 7 de febrero de 2013, la Presidente de la Nación envió el acuerdo al Congreso Nacional para su aprobación (Expediente N° 296/12), debiendo convocar a esos fines a sesiones extraordinarias, dado que el parlamento estaba en receso. Luego del tratamiento en comisiones, ambas cámaras legislativas aprobaron el acuerdo, que fue sancionado Ley Nacional N° 26.843 con fecha 27 de febrero y que, al día siguiente, fue promulgada en el Boletín Oficial del 1 de marzo, todos de 2013 (B.O. N° 32.591). Por su parte, con fecha 10 de marzo de 2013, el entonces Presidente de la República Islámica de Irán, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, envió el acuerdo a su parlamento (Majlis), que el 21 de marzo entró en receso por el Año Nuevo del calendario persa (Nouruz) y recién volvió a sesionar a partir del 8 de abril, sin dar tratamiento en ningún momento al memorando, el cual fue eventualmente retirado de la agenda parlamentaria (Pagni, Carlos, “El kirchnerismo, en el peor de los mundos”, La Nación 30/5/13; “El memorandún con Argentina llega al parlamento iraní”, Europa Press, 11/3/2013; Kollmann, Raúl “Con novedades semana a semana”, Página 12, 24/3/13). Más de dos meses después, exactamente el día 20 de mayo de 2013, Alí Pakdaman, entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Buenos Aires, brindó declaraciones a la prensa informando que el día 19 de mayo el Presidente Ahmadinejad había aprobado el acuerdo con su sola firma (“Teherán aprobó el memorándum por el atentado a la AMIA”, Página 12, 20/05/2013; Kollmann, Raúl, “Ahmadinejad eligió la vía expeditiva”, Página 12, 21/05/2013). Pero lo cierto es que nunca se recibió, hasta el momento, notificación formal de esta presunta aprobación (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°110/13, 21/5/13). Con fecha 4 de agosto tuvo lugar la asunción del nuevo Presidente de la República Islámica de Irán, Hassan Rohani, y - en consecuencia- se operaron cambios de autoridades en distintos ámbitos gubernamentales de Teherán. El 28 de septiembre de 2013, transcurrido un año desde el inicio oficializado de las negociaciones, el nuevo Canciller iraní, Mohammad Javad Zarif, se reunió con el Ministro Timerman en la sede de las Naciones Unidas en Nueva York, Estados Unidos. Luego del encuentro, en declaraciones a la prensa, Timerman sostuvo que Javad Zarif le había asegurado que Irán había aprobado el memorando con el aval del Consejo Superior de Seguridad Nacional y del Líder Supremo (Miri, Ignacio, “Timerman dijo que Irán aprobó el pacto por la AMIA, pero aún no rige”, Clarín, 29/09/2013; Pisani, Silvia, “Irán le confirmó a Timerman que ya aprobó el acuerdo”, La Nación, 29/09/2013; “Timerman anunció nueva reunión con Irán en noviembre”, Prensa Argentina, 28/09/2013; “Timerman ratificó la aprobación del memorándum de entendimiento con Irán y un nuevo encuentro”, Télam, 28/09/2013; “Irán aprobó el memorándum de entendimiento por la AMIA”, Página 12, 28/09/2013). Luego de dos meses más de silencio por parte de Irán, funcionarios de ambas cancillerías volvieron a reunirse en Zúrich, los días 20 y 21 de noviembre de 2013, ocasión en que Argentina entregó una propuesta escrita sobre ciertas cuestiones relativas a la implementación del memorando. Irán se comprometió a dar pronta respuesta (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N° 279/13, 24 de noviembre de 2013) Sin embargo, hasta la fecha y a pesar de haber transcurrido más de un año y medio de su firma y sin perjuicio de las distintas declaraciones realizadas por los funcionarios persas, Irán no ha comunicado formalmente ningún tipo de aprobación interna del acuerdo y - en consecuencia - no se ha producido el intercambio de notas verbales que signa la entrada en vigencia del memorando (punto 6). Por otra parte, ante distintos estrados judiciales argentinos se han formalizado diferentes planteos que cuestionan la constitucionalidad del citado memorando. En concreto, con fecha 15 de mayo de 2014, la Sala I de la Cámara en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal de esta ciudad resolvió hacer lugar a la acción de amparo interpuesta por los representantes de AMIA y DAIA y, en consonancia con lo dictaminado por el suscripto, declaró inconstitucionales tanto el Memorándum de Entendimiento como su ley aprobatoria. Asimismo, dicho tribunal ordenó, de modo preventivo, comunicar lo resuelto al Poder Ejecutivo Nacional -en particular, a la Cancillería- para que no ejecute el acuerdo mientras transitan las vías recursivas. La Sala I también le ordenó al juez de la causa, Dr. Canicoba Corral, que reitere por vía diplomática los pedidos de extradición y cooperación judicial a la República Islámica de Irán, que requiera a Interpol que extreme los esfuerzos para hacer efectivas las ordenes de captura e insista al organismo policial para que revea la posibilidad de emitir notificaciones rojas respecto de Rafsanjani, Velayati y Soleimanpour   Ministerio Público de la Nación (CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 “AMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N°6- Secretaría N°ll). Finalmente, cabe tener presente que con fecha 30 de mayo del corriente, el Ministerio de Justicia y Derechos Humanos recurrió la citada resolución de la Alzada Federal. Sin perjuicio de la vital importancia de contar con una decisión definitiva al respecto, lo cierto es que a los fines de la presente denuncia, este derrotero judicial constituye -en todo caso- una cuestión ajena a las conductas que, en sustancia, aquí se han denunciado. b)	La postura de Irán en relación con la causa AMIA: Desde el inicio de la investigación de la causa AMIA y hasta la actualidad, la República Islámica de Irán siempre ha negado oficialmente el involucramiento de sus nacionales en el atentado; ha, además, entorpecido la pesquisa de todas las formas posibles, por ejemplo, intentando desacreditar a las autoridades judiciales intervinientes; incluso ha tildado al gobierno argentino de financiar al terrorismo y ha intentado negociar políticamente -en varias ocasiones- la absolución de los acusados. Esta postura ha sido mantenida inalterada a lo largo de todos estos años, aun con posterioridad a la firma del acuerdo en enero de 2013. La retórica iraní ha reiterado hasta el hartazgo que ninguno de sus nacionales participó en el atentado, que la justicia argentina no es confiable, que Irán condena al terrorismo y que está dispuesto a colaborar con Argentina para dar con los “verdaderos culpables”. Al hablar de “verdaderos culpables”, evidencia su postura: la acusación argentina ha sido fabricada y orquestada por autoridades judiciales que responden al sionismo y a intereses foráneos, con la participación de agencias de inteligencia de Estados Unidos e Israel. Numerosas declaraciones realizadas, a lo largo de los años, por distintos funcionarios persas, dan cuenta de la postura oficial de Irán, a saber: las misivas enviadas por el Embajador iraní ante la ONU, Mohammad Khazaee, al Presidente de la Asamblea General del organismo - fechadas en 28 de septiembre de 2007, 2008, 2009 y 2010-, las acusaciones formales y las tachas de descrédito realizadas por funcionarios iraníes en contra de distintas autoridades judiciales argentinas abocadas a la causa, etc. (cfr.: Documentos A/62/485, A/63/468, 4/64/481 y A/65/495, AGNU, ONU; “Si los desagravian, Irán colaboraría con la causa AMIA”, ADN Mundo, 4/12/2006; “AMIA: Irán pidió ubicar al responsable real”, Perfil, 29/11/2006; “AMIA: Dura advertencia de Irán al gobierno de Kirchner”, Diario de Cuyo, 11/12/2006; “Irán reaccionó con agravios al pedido de Néstor Kirchner”, Infobae, 27/09/2007; “Ahmadinejad dice que quiere expandir las relaciones con la Argentina”, Clarín, 26/09/2013; Dinatale, Martín, “Negó Irán la denuncia del fiscal Nisman y lo acusó de sionista”, La Nación, 4/6/2013; “Para Irán, la causa AMIA causó amargura en las relaciones entre Irán y Argentina”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 16/07/2013; Braslavsky, Guido, “Irán pide a Interpol la captura del fiscal Nisman y de Galeano”, Clarín, 13/11/2006; “AMIA: dura respuesta iraní a los pedidos de capturas”, Infobae, 13/11/2006; Gallo, Daniel, “Irán amenaza con pedir el arresto de agentes de Interpol”, La Nación, 16/03/2007, “Irán volvió a criticar al sionismo”, La Nación, 19/06/2013; Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, “Irán rechazó, otra vez, su participación en la AMIA”, Clarín, 19/06/2013; “Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/02/2013; “Kirchner ordenó expulsar a D'Elía del gobierno”, La Nación, 14/11/2006; “Tensión diplomática y despido de D'Elía”, La Voz, 14/11/2006; “La Cancillería respondió a otra protesta de Irán”, Clarín, 13/12/2006; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicados de Prensa N°528/06 del 13/11/2006; Comunicado de Prensa N°000/07 “Argentina rechaza pedido de exhorto de Irán”, del 14/08/2007, Comunicado de Prensa N°400/07 “La cancillería argentina rechaza declaraciones difundidas por Irán”, del 28/09/2007; “Argentina expresó un categórico rechazo a dichos de Irán”, El Día, 28/09/2007; “Que Irán respete la jurisdicción”, Página 12, 29/09/2007). Puntualmente, en sus cartas al Presidente de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, en los años 2007 a 2010, el Embajador de Irán ante el organismo Mohammad Khazaee, ha realizado afirmaciones del estilo de: “...los autores del atentado con bomba contra la AMIA han quedado impunes y, en su lugar, se ha acusado injusta e infundadamente a varios nacionales iraníes inocentes...” y “...Todos los argumentos contra los nacionales iraníes no son más que una farsa...” (cfr.: Documentos A/62/485, A/63/468, 4/64/481 y A/65/495, AGNU, ONU). Ahora bien, esta posición no está exenta de consecuencias prácticas. La República Islámica nunca ha prestado colaboración a las autoridades judiciales argentinas, pese a declamar reiteradamente lo contrario. De hecho, de 17 cartas rogatorias libradas  a Irán en el marco de la causa judicial requiriendo información para la investigación del atentado, solamente se ha respondido una. Y esa respuesta fue para hacer saber su negativa a cumplir lo solicitado, argumentando excusas insostenibles y rechazando toda cooperación judicial con el caso (fs. 126.761/126.779 y 127.614/127.657). Por lo demás, también han negado rotundamente la solicitud de detención de los imputados con miras a su extradición, que se les formuló mediante exhorto diplomático en el mes de noviembre de 2006 (fs. 127.063/127.080 y 128.205/128.220). En rigor de verdad, es realmente desvergonzado hablar de cooperación con semejante historial de antecedentes. Por otra parte y como se adelantó, desde el año 2005, en la causa se encuentran acreditados distintos episodios en los cuales autoridades iraníes plantearon, por vías diplomáticas y en forma totalmente indolente, la posibilidad de “negociar” de distintas maneras la extinción de toda investigación, acusación y/o pedido de captura contra sus nacionales (ver fs. 116.381/116.383, 117.251/117.253, 118.680 y 118.952/118.953 bis). En efecto, en más de una ocasión, Irán buscó negociar la impunidad de sus nacionales. Por ejemplo, el 3 de abril de 2005, el Encargado de Negocios de la República Argentina en Irán entregó en mano al Director del Departamento de Asuntos de Derecho Internacional de la Cancillería de ese país, un nuevo exhorto librado en la causa. En esa ocasión, el funcionario iraní condicionó la respuesta de la rogatoria en los siguientes términos: “...Si asistimos al poder judicial argentino: a) ¿No estaremos siendo vistos como acusados o sospechosos? b) Supongamos que recibimos los exhortos y los contestamos [...] Estará el juez dispuesto a anunciar y declarar tajantemente que no existe conexión ni de Irán ni de sus ciudadanos con la explosión de la AMIA? c) ¿Quedará o no el dossier abierto si contestamos? d) ¿cómo podemos saber si el juez cerrará el dossier o no?” Y añadió: “el asunto principal es que de alguna manera podamos estar convencidos de que si colaboramos, el juez de la causa llegará a la conclusión de que el señor X o el señor Y no están ni estuvieron implicados en la explosión de la AMIA. Recuerden que desde el 19 de julio de 1994 nos manifestamos dispuestos a colaborar con la justicia argentina, posición y oferta que continúa aún válida. Si tuviéramos garantías objetivas, cosas tangibles (resultados tangibles) no tendríamos ningún problema en: a) recibir todos los exhortos; b) contestar todos los exhortos: c) incluso más: hacer algunas investigaciones ulteriores en Irán... ” (fs. 116.381/116.383). La misma tónica se repitió por parte de los funcionarios iraníes en la reunión celebrada en Teherán en julio de 2005 entre representantes diplomáticos de nuestro país y el Director de Asuntos de Derecho Internacional local, Dr. Mohsen Baharvand, en relación con los exhortos pendientes de recepción y respuesta por parte del poder judicial iraní. En esa ocasión, el funcionario iraní sostuvo lo siguiente: “Necesitamos de esa visión de perspectiva para poder recibir los exhortos y responderlos, pues tenga en mente que se trata de funcionarios del gobierno iraní y no ciudadanos ordinarios; en definitiva, cada vez que uno tiene algo para dar tiene expectativas de recibir también (...) La parte iraní es sumamente flexible con los exhortos, solo complicamos las cosas cuando es absolutamente necesario (sic) y ese no es el caso de las relaciones con argentina ” (fs. 117.251/117.253). Otro ejemplo de esta actitud iraní en cuanto a su colaboración en la causa surge de un “non paper” entregado por el mencionado Baharvand a diplomáticos argentinos, con una propuesta de acuerdo entre ambos países (fs. 118.680, 118.952/118.953bis). El pacto ofrecido entonces por Irán decía: “1. Las partes aceptan que no ha existido ninguna acusación contra ciudadanos iraníes en relación con la Causa AMIA; no obstante ello, el proceso que sigue el Juez argentino a cargo de la investigación en lo que respecta a los ciudadanos iraníes fue ordenado con el mero fin de recopilar información ”. “2. Las partes... se abstendrán de efectuar cualquier tipo de inferencia criminal, tanto en forma directa como indirecta, o acusación contra la otra parte y sus funcionarios “3... ¡as cartas rogatorias libradas por el Juez de la Argentina serán enmendadas de forma tal que no se formule ningún alegato o acusación, ya sea en forma explícita o implícita, contra el gobierno iraní y sus ciudadanos... ”. ""4. Tras lo dispuesto en el párrafo tercero, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Irán recibirá oficialmente ¡as cartas rogatorias... ”. “5. La parte argentina ...revocará cualquier orden de arresto librada por el Juez a cargo de la investigación contra los ciudadanos de la República Islámica de Irán... La reseña aquí efectuada revela la insólita postura asumida por el gobierno iraní en el sentido de condicionar su colaboración al compromiso de las autoridades judiciales argentinas de no incriminar a funcionarios y/o ciudadanos de ese país. Por otra parte y con motivo de dos solicitudes dirigidas a obtener información sobre titulares de líneas telefónicas, las autoridades iraníes, a través de Interpol Teherán, respondieron, a la primera de ellas: “no nos es posible responder vuestra solicitud debido la importancia del respeto de los principios y de las reglas de los derechos humanos, y también de las leyes internas de Irán acerca del respeto de la vida privada de las personas” (fs. 908 del legajo 391). En el restante pedido, lejos de brindar la información requerida, se limitaron a señalar: “...favor de explicarnos el motivo e informarnos también de dónde obtuvieron estos números de teléfono... ” (fs. 6843 del legajo 201). Sentado ello, no puede menos que considerarse absurdas y descabelladas las excusas brindadas por el régimen iraní para no dar respuesta a las solicitudes argentinas, con el agravante de que, aun cuando luego fueron enviados a Teherán los datos requeridos, ni siquiera así se obtuvo contestación. Más allá de la prueba documental, este tipo de ofrecimientos fueron reconocidos por varios funcionarios argentinos de entonces que, dadas sus posiciones en puestos claves, tomaron conocimiento de distintas propuestas de Irán para dejar de lado la imputación por AMIA. Al respecto, cabe recordar un acuerdo rechazado por Néstor Kirchner del cual dieron cuenta el ex Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fernández y el ex Vice Canciller, Roberto García Moritán. Por su parte, los ex Cancilleres Rafael Bielsa y Jorge Taiana, pusieron de manifiesto la postura de Irán aquí descripta, conforme observaron durante sus respectivas gestiones en el Palacio San Martín. Rafael Bielsa mencionó la oferta iraní de cuatro mil millones de dólares en compras de maíz y trigo para retomar así el comercio bilateral, pero a condición de dejar de lado la causa AMIA. Expresó: “...era una actitud extorsiva... ” y al describir el desempeño de la diplomacia iraní en general refirió:	“Siempre nos estaban haciendo trampa...les explicábamos que acá el Poder Ejecutivo no le da órdenes al Judicial, muchísimo menos en una causa de esta naturaleza. Ellos se hacían los que no entendían...”. Y agregó: “...Es un país manifiestamente hostil que se ha negado a contestar todos los exhortos... Les decíamos: los vamos a seguir hasta debajo de ¡a cama, acá no hay arreglo, contesten los exhortos. Uno de sus argumentos era: se están perdiendo 4 mil millones de dólares...Jamás hubo la más mínima concesión...ellos querían que un punto sugiriera que podía haber algún error por parte del Poder Judicial en el requerimiento de estos dignatarios iraníes...” (el resaltado es propio, Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013; “Causa AMIA: Para D'Elía, los acusados iraníes van a ser sobreseídos”, Infobae, 1/3/2013, “Irán le ofreció un acuerdo igual a Néstor Kirchner, pero lo rechazó”, Infobae, 14/02/2013; “Duro cruce de acusaciones entre Timerman y García Moritán”, La Nación, 19/02/2013; “Alberto Fernández: Néstor Kirchner siempre se negó a un acuerdo con Irán”, Iprofesional, 20/02/2013). En la misma línea, el ex Canciller Jorge Taiana aseveró que los iraníes habían mostrado “falta de voluntad” dado que “ni siquiera recibían las solicitudes, o sea, las rechazaban y descalificaban. No hubo ninguna muestra de que existiera la más mínima voluntad de ayudar a esclarecer el hecho...” (Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013). Incluso, las autoridades persas se han valido de ciudadanos argentinos profundamente consustanciados con las ideas del régimen y, al mismo tiempo, con vínculos con las autoridades del gobierno argentino, como Luis D’Elía, para hacer llegar sus propuestas de una solución favorable a sus intereses en torno a las imputaciones del caso AMIA. Efectivamente, el régimen de Irán aprovechó un viaje realizado por Luis D’Elía, Fernando Esteche y Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, a fines de febrero y principios de marzo de 2010, para proponer un acuerdo relacionado con el atentado (“Quejas de Israel por el viaje de D'Elía a Irán”, La Nación, 07/03/2010; “D'Elía admitió un encuentro con un ex funcionario iraní prófugo en la causa AMIA”, La Prensa, 07/03/2010; “D’Elía y Esteche vieron en Irán a un sospechoso de volar la AMIA”, Perfil, 06/03/2010; “D'Elía sigue defendiendo al prófugo de la AMIA: Es una buena persona”, Clarín, 09/03/2010; “Diputados repudió el viaje de D’Elía a Irán y pidió informes a Cancillería”, Infobae, 07/04/2010). Increíblemente ahora se constata que dicho acuerdo era similar al Memorando de Entendimiento firmado por el canciller Timerman en enero del año pasado. Así lo recordó D’Elía al manifestarle a Khalil: “...Es parecido a lo que nos propusieron en el primer viaje a Teherán ¿te acordás?...” (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado N°11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-174637-12, CD 266). Esto da la pauta, como se analizará y acreditará en detalle en el acápite correspondiente, que el instrumento jurídico que han firmado Argentina e Irán nada tiene que ver con la búsqueda de justicia ni con el avance de la investigación sino que se trata de uno de los medios elegidos para conseguir un fin delictivo y atroz: garantizar la impunidad definitiva a los acusados iraníes de la causa por el atentado contra la AMIA a través de un salvoconducto con apariencia de legalidad. Finalmente, cabe recordar, solo a modo de ejemplo porque fueron muchos los intentos de Teherán en este sentido, que en septiembre de 2007, el entonces vocero del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Irán, Mohammad Alí Hosseini, ofreció: “Como acto humanitario y para esclarecer los hechos de esta tragedia, la República Islámica anunció de antemano admitir la formación de un comité jurídico bilateral con Argentina, a pesar de la ausencia de acuerdo y desavenencia que hay entre los aparatos judiciales de ambos países'’’’ (“Irán reaccionó con agravios al pedido de Néstor Kirchner”, Infobae, 27/09/2007). Obviamente, ese ofrecimiento -no muy distinto al acuerdo firmado- fue rechazado por Néstor Kirchner. En fin, Irán siempre sostuvo y pidió lo mismo, lo que confirma que en dicho país existió y existe la decisión política no solo de no cooperar y de no reconocer la soberanía jurisdiccional argentina en el caso, sino de entorpecer y atacar todo avance que se realice. Ahora bien, resulta claro que la elocuente falta de cooperación exhibida por las autoridades iraníes respecto de esta investigación, es el reflejo, o bien la consecuencia, de la estrategia históricamente sostenida por el régimen de Teherán que consistió y consiste aún hoy en negar toda relación de sus ciudadanos con el atentado y jamás brindar cualquier tipo de información a la pesquisa para, así, desligar toda responsabilidad que le pudiera caber por actos de terrorismo, negando la detención con fines de extradición de los individuos que la justicia argentina ha imputado judicialmente por el hecho y buscando deslegitimar -de distintas formas- a la investigación y a las autoridades que la encabezan. Eso demuestra que existe una decisión política para garantizar impunidad tomada por las más altas autoridades del régimen, que también planificaron y ordenaron el atentado que acabó con la vida de 85 personas. Sin perjuicio de la firme negativa del régimen, se han obtenido declaraciones reveladoras de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, representante de los intereses y agente orgánico de Irán en Argentina y partícipe activo del encubrimiento aquí denunciado, que reconocen la responsabilidad de funcionarios iraníes en los atentados en Argentina. En referencia a un individuo señaló: “...la persona que taburó con Irán...cuando Irán mató acá” (Comunicación del 19/11/12, abonado N°11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2012-11-19-083552-16, CD 197). En otra oportunidad, confesó que el Subsecretario de Agricultura Familiar para la Nación y líder del Movimiento Evita, Emilio Pérsico: “...siempre tuvo el discurso de que nosotros fuimos....y está bien hecho... as i dice él. Es la pelea” (Comunicación del 15/8/13, abonado N°11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-08-15-234919-2, CD 118). Es decir, que los iraníes fueron los responsables del atentado y que a entender de Pérsico estaban justificados por su lucha política. En igual sentido, citando a D’Elía, Pérsico: ""...fue el que dijo que ustedes fueron el tema AMIA...”, en alusión a la responsabilidad de iraníes por el atentado (Comunicación del 15/8/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-08-15-234225-2, CD 118). Estas referencias solo deben ser entendidas como meros ejemplos y, en modo alguno, como nuevas pruebas para fundar la acusación por el atentado, que -como se sabe- ya ha sido volcada en anteriores dictámenes fiscales y en los pronunciamientos del Juez de la causa, Dr. Canicoba Corral. Estas manifestaciones tampoco hacen a la prueba del encubrimiento, sin embargo permiten visualizar que la estrategia del régimen de la República Islámica de Irán de negación perpetua rindió sus frutos. Es decir, a pesar de ser efectivamente responsables por el atentado, la circunstancia de haberlo negado por lustros y lustros acabó desembocando en este plan encubridor que pretendió desacreditar a la justicia argentina y, fundamentalmente, estuvo dirigido a garantizar la impunidad total y definitiva de los acusados iraníes. De hecho, según surge del documento que bajo juramento declaró haber leído el Sr. José Eliaschev, la solidez de la postura iraní de no cooperar judicialmente ni ceder un ápice antes las acusaciones argentinas fue reconocida por el ex canciller iraní Ali Akbar Salehi como una exitosa estrategia del Líder Supremo. Salehi elogió esta estrategia cuando -como se verá más adelante-, en enero de 2011, Héctor Timerman abandonó el reclamo argentino de justicia y le ofreció articular un modo para dejar de lado las acusaciones por el atentado y retomar el comercio bilateral (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913). En suma, Irán nunca tuvo intención de cooperar y, en la práctica, siempre estorbó la actuación judicial argentina y los acercamientos diplomáticos, políticos y judiciales que aceptó tuvieron por única finalidad extinguir las acusaciones contra sus nacionales y desvincular a Irán del caso, aunque ello se derivara de la aplicación de medios prohibidos. Resulta útil destacar que esta estrategia no solamente ha sido implementada por Teherán respecto al caso AMIA, sino que también fue   Ministerio Público de la Nación replicada en relación a otros atentados terroristas perpetrados en distintos rincones del planeta donde, también fundadamente, se ha involucrado judicialmente a funcionarios del régimen iraní como responsable de hechos de terrorismo. Jamás se ha advertido cambio alguno en la postura iraní, que ni siquiera morigeró su clásica retórica después de iniciadas oficialmente las negociaciones y aún luego de haber firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, alegando “de la boca para afuera”, como es su costumbre, su buena predisposición para el diálogo y la negociación, al tiempo que, en los hechos, buscaba deslegitimar por cualquier medio los pronunciamientos de la justicia argentina y, consecuentemente, también a sus funcionarios. En esta línea se inscriben los siguientes cuatro episodios, solo a modo de ejemplo: 1) el entonces portavoz de la cancillería iraní, Ramin Mehmanparast, declaró en octubre de 2012 -cuando las negociaciones ya eran públicas- que se rechazaban las acusaciones contra ciudadanos iraníes y que su gobierno estaba dispuesto a colaborar para dar con los ejecutores del atentado (“Irán volvió a rechazar todas las acusaciones por el atentado a la AMIA”, La Nación, 30/10/2012; Paraszczuk, Joanna, “Irán ready to identify AMIA bombing perpetrators”, Jerusalem Post, 30/10/12; Kollmann, Raúl: “Irán volvió a negar su culpabilidad”, Página 12, 31/10/12); 2) según un cable de la agencia IRNA, la postura oficial de Irán -ya firmado el acuerdo con Argentina- era que el atentado podría haber sido planeado por Israel: “...Irán dice que agentes de Tel Aviv estuvieron involucrados en el ataque...con el objetivo de aumentar su influencia sobre el gobierno de entonces en Buenos Aires...” (“Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/02/2013; “FM: Irán, Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, Irán Daily Brief, 14/2/13; “El Canciller de Irán dice que negoció durante dos años el acuerdo con Argentina”, Clarín, 12/02/2013; “Salehi: Irán Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, IRNA, 12/02/2013); 3) las expresiones de la cancillería iraní que buscaron deslegitimar el trabajo de la Unidad Fiscal a cargo del suscripto y el dictamen de fecha 29/05/2013 sosteniendo: “...Debido a la historia y carácter sionista de ese fiscal [por Nisman], nosotros no damos ninguna importancia a sus afirmaciones...” (“Irán rechazó las acusaciones del fiscal Alberto Nisman al considerarlo sionista”, La Nación, 3/6/2013; “El ministerio exteriores de Irán: No le damos importancia a las declaraciones de Nisman”, IRNA, 5/6/2013); 4) en junio de 2013, ya firmado el acuerdo, otro vocero de la cancillería iraní -Abbas Araqchi- volvió a rechazar la participación de iraníes en el atentado, declaró que para Teherán fueron agentes extranjeros y sionistas los que estuvieron detrás del ataque y agregó: “Gracias a Dios, con la colaboración de los cancilleres de Irán y la Argentina, se está viendo la manera razonable para solucionar el tema de la AMIA, y está habiendo una mayor comprensión de que los factores extranjeros y sionistas fueron los verdaderos causantes de este lamentable hecho...” (Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, “Irán rechazó, otra vez, su participación en la AMIA”, Clarín, 19/06/2013; “Irán volvió a criticar al sionismo”, La Nación, 19/06/2013), acusaciones que reiteraría el mismo portavoz en julio de 2013 (“Para Irán, la causa AMIA causó amargura en las relaciones entre Irán y Argentina”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 16/07/2013). Nunca antes el gobierno argentino había permanecido mudo ante este tipo de declaraciones. Pero desde que se produjo el acercamiento con Irán, comenzó un silencio cómplice de parte de las autoridades argentinas aquí denunciadas ante este tipo de expresiones y/o ataques a los actos jurisdiccionales soberanos de distintos órganos de la república, variando la postura que se mantuvo inalterada durante el mandato de Néstor Kirchner, lo que constituye un nuevo indicio de la existencia de un acuerdo previo entre las dos partes que -desafortunadamente- tuvo por norte el plan de encubrimiento aquí denunciado, en el cual las autoridades argentinas se mostraron más interesadas en avanzar que su contraparte. Así, el incomprensible silencio del gobierno argentino, mantenido a pesar de la gravedad de las acusaciones y desacreditaciones por parte de las autoridades del gobierno iraní, habla por sí solo en este nuevo contexto. Es decir, las autoridades iraníes persisten, hasta el presente, no solo en negar oficialmente toda colaboración de Irán con el caso, sino - fundamentalmente- agrediendo y buscando desacreditar de distintas formas la acusación de la justicia argentina, pretendiendo poner en duda la imparcialidad de las investigaciones y sugiriendo -siempre- la influencia de intereses foráneos que habían sesgado la pesquisa aviesamente en contra de Irán. Más recientemente y en ocasión del fallo de la Cámara en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal que declaró la inconstitucionalidad del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado con Irán, y de su ley aprobatoria, las autoridades iraníes tuvieron una reacción a todas luces provocativa, teniendo en cuenta, fundamentalmente, su parsimonia en tomo a la aprobación del acuerdo. En esa oportunidad, la vocera del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores, Marziyeh Afkham, condenó fuertemente el fallo y declaró: “El gobierno iraní cree que el Memorando de Entendimiento era una solución adecuada y una oportunidad para descubrir los hechos relativos a la tragedia de la AMIA y la resolución de las diferencias al respecto, pero la decisión de la corte argentina priva a ambas partes de esa oportunidad. Por ¡o tanto, la República Islámica de Irán expresa su pesar y descontento por la decisión’’’ (“Irán criticizes Argentine court decisión to declare unconstitutional joint AMIA bombing probe with Irán”, IRNA, 16/05/2014; “Irán slams argentine court ruling on AMIA probe”, Fars News Agency, 17/05/2014; “Irán condemns argentine court ruling on AMIA probe”, PressTV, 16/05/2014; Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, “Irán lamenta la decisión de la Justicia argentina”, Clarín, 16/05/2014; “Irán expresó pesar y descontento por el fallo que invalidó el memorándum sobre el atentado a la AMIA”, La Nación, 16/05/2014). El doble discurso no solo es patrimonio exclusivo de las autoridades argentinas aquí denunciadas. Los iraníes han sabido utilizarlo a la perfección. Es decir que, a pesar del tiempo transcurrido sin que exista comunicación oficial de aprobación interna del acuerdo por parte de Irán, sus autoridades sostuvieron públicamente su interés en el pacto. Nuevamente, la kilométrica distancia entre las palabras y los hechos. Finalmente, solo resta destacar que la retórica de negación y obstrucción iraní tuvo excelente resonancia en el gobierno de Cristina Fernández y, según se verá más adelante, fue usufructuada por las autoridades argentinas aquí denunciadas, para avanzar con las maniobras de encubrimiento e impunidad de los acusados. c)	Presidencia de Néstor Carlos Kirchner Durante el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner la posición de la República Argentina en relación al atentado contra la AMIA fue clara y consistente: todos los esfuerzos políticos se enderezaron a respaldar el accionar de la justicia argentina y, desde el ámbito de sus competencias, el entonces Presidente de la Nación intentó lograr la cooperación de Irán y el aval de la comunidad internacional. Es decir, durante todo su mandato, se mantuvo de manera inconmovible el apoyo del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional a las conclusiones de este Ministerio Público y a las decisiones del Poder Judicial en tomo a la causa. El caso AMIA fue una política de Estado. Este respaldo se tradujo en distintas acciones concretas, que van desde la desclasificación de información de inteligencia (Decreto N° 787 del 17 de septiembre de 2003) y la creación de esta Unidad Fiscal de Investigación en el año 2004 (Resolución MP 84/04), hasta el discurso pronunciado por el ex Presidente en el año 2007 ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, cuando denunció la falta de colaboración de Irán y solicitó que “la República Islámica de Irán, en el marco del derecho internacional aplicable, acepte y respete la jurisdicción de la justicia argentina, y colabore eficazmente con los jueces argentinos para lograr el sometimiento a juicio de las personas imputadas en aquellos hechos’’'’ (Discurso de Néstor Kirchner en la 62a Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 25 de septiembre de 2007). 2	Se trata de: Alí Akbar Hashemi Bahramaie Rafsanjani (a la época de los hechos presidente de la República Islámica de Irán), Alí Fallahijan (por entonces Ministro de Información iraní), Alí Akbar Velayati (en aquel tiempo Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de la nación persa), Mohsen Rezai (por entonces a cargo del Cuerpo de la Guardia Revolucionaria “Pasdaran”), Ahmad Vahidi (en aquella época a cargo de la fuerza de elite “Al Quds” perteneciente a la Guardia Revolucionaria), Mohsen Rabbani (al tiempo de los hechos Consejero Cultural de la Embajada iraní en nuestro país), Ahmad Reza Asghari o Mohsen Randjbaran (en aquel entonces Tercer Secretario de la representación diplomática iraní en nuestro medio), Hadi Soleimanpour (en aquella época Embajador de la República Islámica de Irán en Buenos Aires) e Imad Fayez Moughnieh (por entonces a cargo del Servicio Exterior del Hezbollah). Moughnieh era el único libanés en aquel resolutorio. Los demás eran todos ciudadanos iraníes. La Unidad Fiscal no formuló imputación a Hadi Soleimanpour, sin perjuicio de lo cual, el Sr. Juez de la causa fundó la acusación y dispuso también su captura. De ese modo, Néstor Kirchner inauguró este destacable recurso diplomático: peticionar ante la comunidad internacional, utilizando legítima y estratégicamente los foros y la opinión internacionales para poner en evidencia la inadmisible postura iraní, convirtiendo -de ese modo- al descrédito internacional en un factor de presión legítimo y conducente a lograr el objetivo requerido por los órganos judiciales: el sometimiento a proceso de los imputados iraníes para avanzar en el enjuiciamiento de aquellas personas judicialmente responsabilizadas por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA. Además, y en cada oportunidad en que el gobierno de la República Islámica de Irán, a través de declaraciones de sus funcionarios y/o por otras vías, intentó deslegitimar la investigación por el caso AMIA haciendo llegar descalificaciones respecto de los funcionarios intervinientes en la pesquisa y -más aún- cuando se conocieron acusaciones judiciales de Irán contra estos funcionarios, el gobierno del Presidente Néstor Kirchner siempre repudió aquellos descréditos, pidiendo -por las vías diplomáticas correspodientes- las explicaciones a que hubiere lugar, como un modo adecuado de proteger y respaldar el accionar de la justicia argentina. Ejemplo de ello fue la reacción que tuvo el Poder Ejecutivo cuando en el año 2006, se conocieron trascendidos que aseveraban que la justicia iraní solicitaría el arresto y la extradición del suscripto y del Dr. Juan José Galeano, ya separado de la magistratura, ocasión en que la Cancillería argentina no demoró en solicitar explicaciones sobre la cuestión al Encargado de Negocios iraní en Buenos Aires, Mohsen Baharvand, máxima autoridad diplomática persa en territorio nacional (Comunicado de Prensa N°528/06 del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de fecha 13/11/2006; Braslavsky, Guido, “Irán pide a Interpol la captura del fiscal Nisman y de Galeano”, Clarín, 13/11/2006, “AMIA: dura respuesta iraní a los pedidos de capturas”, Infobae, 13/11/2006; “Tensión diplomática y despido de D'Elía”, La Voz, 14/011/2006). Y	no fue la única oportunidad en que la cancillería argentina respondió a protestas indebidas o expresiones desafortunadas, por calificarlas de la forma más benévola, procedentes de funcionarios de Teherán (cfr.: “La Cancillería respondió a otra protesta de Irán”, Clarín, 13/12/2006; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°000/07 “Argentina rechaza pedido de exhorto de Irán”, del 14/08/2007; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°400/07, “La cancillería argentina rechaza declaraciones difundidas por Irán”, del 28/09/2007; “Argentina expresó un categórico rechazo a dichos de Irán”, El Día, 28/09/2007; “Que Irán respete la jurisdicción”, Página 12, 29/09/2007). Como prueba del posicionamiento político-estratégico que Néstor Kirchner adoptó en torno al caso AMIA desde el Palacio San Martín, cabe tener presente las palabras de los ex Cancilleres, Jorge Taiana y Rafael Bielsa. Al respecto, el ex Ministro Taiana sostuvo: “No hubo ningún diálogo. Nuestro planteo era: no se puede hablar de nada mientras no haya colaboración judicial...Nuestra posición fue:	tenemos 85 muertos argentinos y no podemos hacer ninguna concesión ni darle facilidad a un Estado que no muestra signos de buscar algún tipo de solución que ayude a esclarecer el hecho...”. Irán debía entregar a los acusados (Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013). Por su parte, Rafael Bielsa, además de describir la actitud extorsiva y las propuestas de comercio iraníes a cambio de zanjar el tema AMIA, corroboró que el caso para el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner había sido “una política de Estado” y señaló que, en cambio, el gobierno de Cristina Fernández “le dice a los familiares que los que comercian son las empresas y no el Estado. Me parece un argumento pelotudo, me fastidia mucho porque era un tema sagrado para Néstor...” y que: “Cuando era canciller, hablar de venderle o comprarle a Irán era casus belir (el resaltado es propio, Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013).  En lo concerniente al modo de llevar adelante contactos con Teherán, Bielsa destacó que, durante su gestión, la cancillería tenía una política de transparencia con los principales interesados en la causa: '''""Estábamos en permanente contacto con los familiares y la comunidad, informándolos de todo....Cada paso que dábamos, cada memorándum que enviábamos, lo consultábamos con todos, porque era una cuestión muy sensible y estaba siempre el fantasma de las ofertas...'’'1 (Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013). Esto resume la dirección que la política exterior tuvo en aquellos años en lo concerniente al caso AMIA. A nivel local, Néstor Kirchner también mantuvo en todo momento su apoyo a la causa judicial, al punto de separar del cargo a un miembro de su propio gobierno, como ocurrió con el caso de Luis D’Elía. Cabe recordar que en noviembre de 2006, casi inmediatamente después de conocerse la resolución del Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral que decretó las capturas de funcionarios iraníes por estar sospechados de participar en el atentado, el entonces Subsecretario Nacional de Tierras para el Hábitat Social, Sr. Luis D’ Elía, encabezó una protesta contra aquella decisión y emitió un comunicado expresando: “el dictamen judicial que acusa a la República Islámica de Irán por el tema AMIA está profundamente contaminado por circunstancias mundiales ajenas a la búsqueda de la verdad’’ (Comunicado del 13/11/2006, firmado por Luis D'Elía y Juan José Cantiello, entregado al entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Buenos Aires, Mohsen Baharvand). Según trascendió, la protesta en repudio a la decisión de la justicia argentina, llevada a cabo en la Embajada de Irán y liderada por D'Elía -con participación del referente de Irán en Argentina, Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil- había sido incitada por el entonces Embajador de Venezuela en Buenos Aires, Roger Capella. Este diplomático venezolano estaba estrechamente vinculado con Teherán y, ya desde aquellos años, favorecía la relación entre Irán, los imputados iraníes por el caso AMIA y ciertos referentes locales, como Luis D'Elía y Fernando Esteche (“Kirchner ordenó expulsar a D'Elía del gobierno”, La Nación, 14/11/2006; Gallo, Daniel, “Controvertida agenda política del Embajador de Venezuela”, La Nación, 16/11/2006). Tal comportamiento motivó que el ex Presidente Kirchner removiera inmediatamente a Luis D’Elía de su cargo en el Ejecutivo Nacional, al tiempo que se comunicó con su par de Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, quien a los pocos días hizo cesar la misión diplomática del Embajador Capella en Argentina. En otras palabras y en este contexto, Néstor Kirchner no hesitó en intervenir, aunque la cuestión pudiera generar tensiones con un mandatario extranjero, en este caso, Hugo Chávez, entonces presidente de Venezuela. En relación al desplazamiento de D’Elía, funcionarios del gobierno de Kirchner explicaron a la prensa que, a entender del presidente, el ex funcionario: “cruzó una línea infranqueable: nunca jamás, un funcionario del gobierno debe abrir juicios sobre causas judiciales abiertas, y menos si atañen a un tema tan sensible como la voladura de la AMIA” (“Kirchner ordenó expulsar a D'Elía del gobierno”, La Nación, 14/11/2006). También por aquellos años, como quedó expresado en el punto anterior, Néstor Kirchner rechazó distintos intentos iraníes de “negociar” una salida acordada que termine con la investigación judicial en contra de sus nacionales, lo que no solo surge de la causa (ver fs. 116.381/116.383, 117.251/117.253, 118.680 y 118.952/118.953 bis) sino también de lo relatado por los ex Cancilleres Rafael Bielsa y Jorge Taiana, por el ex Jefe de Gabinete Alberto Fernández y por el ex Vice canciller Roberto García Moritán (Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013; “Irán le ofreció un acuerdo igual a Néstor Kirchner, pero lo rechazó”, Infobae, 14/2/03; “Alberto Fernández: Néstor Kirchner siempre se negó a un acuerdo con Irán”, Iprofesional, 20/2/2013). Además de los episodios narrados en el acápite previo, apenas libradas las órdenes de captura, Kirchner rechazó un acuerdo que le ofreció Irán que, según atestiguan funcionarios con conocimiento del hecho, era /VI RF. muy parecido al memorando que terminó firmando Héctor Timerman en Etiopía (“Irán le ofreció un acuerdo igual a Néstor Kirchner, pero lo rechazó”, Infobae, 14/02/2013; “Duro cruce de acusaciones entre Timerman y García Moritán”, La Nación, 19/02/2013; “Alberto Fernández: Néstor Kirchner siempre se negó a un acuerdo con Irán”, Iprofesional, 20/02/2013). La existencia de este antecedente fue confirmada por quien fuera Vice Canciller de 2005 a 2008, Roberto García Moritán, y por el entonces Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fernández, es decir, dos altos funcionarios del gobierno de Néstor Kirchner que, por sus respectivos cargos en el Ejecutivo Nacional, se hallaban directamente involucrados en el tratamiento de estas cuestiones. García Moritán afirmó que los iraníes habían ofrecido un acuerdo que “también tenía 9 puntos y era muy similar al actuar y que “con sus matices, tenía el mismo espíritu” (“Irán le ofreció un acuerdo igual a Néstor Kirchner, pero lo rechazó”, Infobae, 14/2/03). Por su parte, Alberto Fernández aseveró que hubo “una oferta iraní de empezar conversaciones y buscar un mecanismo de salida, con un tercer país o una comisión. Pero Kirchner siempre se negó...Kirchner nunca aceptó hacer estas cosas...” (“Alberto Fernández: Néstor Kirchner siempre se negó a un acuerdo con Irán”, Iprofesional, 20/2/2013). Ante estas declaraciones y buscando ocultar los hechos aquí denunciados, Timerman decidió recurrir a la deslegitimación personal de quienes dieron testimonio sobre esta circunstancia, del mismo modo que ya lo había hecho cuando el periodista José Ricardo Eliaschev comunicó la verdadera entidad de las reuniones en Siria (“Duro cruce de acusaciones entre Timerman y García Moritán”, La Nación, 19/02/2013). En vez de rebatir o responder por los hechos que habían tomado estado público, el Canciller recurrió a la falacia “ad hominem”, para intentar ocultar las circunstancias que hacían al plan criminal. Luego, en ocasión de exponer ante los legisladores, Timerman no tuvo más que reconocer que era cierto lo dicho por García Moritán, en tanto Néstor Kirchner había rechazado un acuerdo con Irán que incluía una comisión, pero para desdibujar los hechos argumentó que lo falso era que dicha propuesta hubiera sido similar al memorando ahora suscripto y señaló: “...rechazamos lo que no incorporaba a la justicia y aceptamos el memorándum que incorpora a la justicia argentina...” (Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Justicia y Asuntos Constitucionales de la Cámara de Diputados, Congreso Nacional, desarrollado el 26 de febrero de 2013). Haber dicho que el acuerdo actual es diferente al rechazado por Kirchner porque el Memorando de Entendimiento ha incorporado a la “justicia”, constituyó una falacia argumentativa, dado que de la propia letra del pacto se desprende que la participación de las autoridades judiciales argentinas está supeditada y mediada por la actuación de la comisión, lo que toma pasible de nulidad cualquier acto que pretenda concebirse como procesal. Como se verá más adelante, no será la única ni la más grave de las faalcias. Y así, mediante estas falsas argumentaciones se buscó ocultar una realidad insoslayable: Cristina Fernández autorizó y Héctor Timerman gestionó y firmó un pacto que Néstor Kirchner nunca hubiera aceptado ni permitido suscribir. Lo afirmado por Roberto García Moritán y Alberto Fernández ha sido corroborado por prueba recientemente obtenida, donde el máximo referente iraní en Argentina, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil reconoció expresamente que el acuerdo firmado con Irán es el mismo que estuvo en danza seis años antes y que en aquel entonces había sido rechazado. En efecto, el 27 de enero de 2013, en sendas comunicaciones, Khalil manifestó en relación al Memorando de Entendimiento: “...lo único que sé, es que es el mismo documento que hicimos nosotros hace seis años y lo presentamos, tanto a la gente de la embajada de Irán como a gente del gobierno...”, “...ese plan lo hicimos con Fernando Esteche hace seis años...”, “...el acuerdo que hicimos hace seis años nosotros con Fernando Esteche y nos trataron de locos a nosotros ...cuando lo planteamos, lo mismo, está escrito, hace seis, siete años, en el 2006...nos dijeron 'están locos, esto no tiene asidero'...hoy lo sacaron...”, “...el mismo, boludo, el mismo pusieron... como lo dijimos nosotros ...todo como lo escribimos con Fernando hace seis años...” (Comunicaciones del 27/01/2013, abonado N°11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l 009-2013-01-27-112032-4, CD 266; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-112552-12, CD 266; Archivo B-l 009-2013-01-27- 113208-14, CD 266). Y a Luis D'Elía, le confesó: “... ¿Sabés quien me lo escribió a mí, ese día, el memorando ese, quién lo escribió?...Fernando...”, en alusión a Esteche (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado N°11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-01-27-174637-12, CD 266). Lo cierto es que en todos los casos, el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner entendió -justamente- que estas propuestas conllevaban una injerencia inadecuada del Ejecutivo en el ámbito judicial y - fundamentalmente- representaban una claudicación en el reclamo legítimo de memoria y justicia por el caso AMIA. En suma, durante todo su mandato y podría decirse mientras vivió, el ex Presidente Néstor Kirchner fue consecuente con su postura con el caso AMIA: un fuerte reclamo a Irán por su falta de cooperación en la causa, la firme decisión de rechazar las propuestas iraníes que propiciaban dejar de lado las conclusiones de la justicia argentina y su inestimable apoyo a lo actuado por ella en la investigación por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA fueron los ejes centrales de esta política de estado. a)	Presidencia de Cristina Elisabet Fernández La línea forjada por Néstor Kirchner en torno al caso continuó durante los primeros años del mandato de su esposa Cristina Fernández, quien también, en la sede de las Naciones Unidas, reclamó a Irán por su negativa a permitir que los imputados sean sometidos a la justicia argentina. La inconmovible negativa iraní a cumplir con este legítimo requerimiento fue logrando, de algún modo, erosionar las expectativas del gobierno nacional en los últimos años y, en consecuencia, los reclamos articulados desde entonces evidenciaron condicionamientos que, en cierta medida, los hicieron contraer. En este sentido, el ofrecimiento de realizar el juicio en un tercer país y/o ante la presencia de veedores internacionales representó cierta flexibilización -legítima, por cierto- de la demanda inicial. Sin embargo, aún en esas instancias, el objetivo perseguido consistió siempre en que Irán someta a los imputados a nuestra jurisdicción, es decir, a nuestras leyes, nuestros jueces y a nuestra investigación. Justamente, en esa línea, el 24 de septiembre de 2010, la Sra. Presidente Cristina Fernández se dirigió a la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas y ofreció la posibilidad de elegir de común acuerdo un tercer país en donde llevar a cabo el enjuiciamiento de los ciudadanos iraníes acusados por el atentado (Discurso de Cristina Fernández en la 65° Asamblea General de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2010). Dicha oferta fue respondida mediante una carta del Representante Permanente de la República Islámica de Irán ante Naciones Unidas, Embajador Mohammed Khazaee, en la cual expresó que las acusaciones argentinas carecían de fundamento y que la actual investigación transitaba un ''''camino equivocado” que no llevaría a encontrar a los “auténticos autores” del atentado. Tachó de falsa, arbitraria e infundada la acusación a los ciudadanos iraníes, afirmando que el procedimiento judicial argentino estaba plagado de irregularidades, violaba garantías procesales y derechos fundamentales y no tenía por fin la verdad y la justicia. Asimismo, aseveró que: “El Gobierno de la República Islámica del Irán se ha cerciorado de que ningún ciudadano iraní estuvo implicado, directa o indirectamente, en la explosión del AMIA”. Y acusó a las autoridades argentinas de colaborar y financiar a grupos terroristas -como los Muyahidin Jalq- para, finalmente, afirmar que había sido el gobierno argentino el que -hasta ese momento- se había sistemáticamente negado a negociar un marco jurídico de cooperación en cuestiones judiciales, insistiendo en imponer sus decisiones unilaterales (Carta del 28 de septiembre de 2010 dirigida al Presidente de la Asamblea General por el Representante Permanente de la República Islámica de Irán ante las /\: ^f-RTO NISMA Ministerio Público de la Nación	riscAL; ■- Naciones Unidas, Mohammad Khazaee). En suma, este último ofrecimiento de la Dra. Fernández quedó trunco por una nueva respuesta de Teherán, tan falsa como provocativa. Hasta aquí, se ha demostrado la consistencia que durante años tuvo la postura oficial argentina en torno al caso AMIA, durante todo el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner y parte del mandato de Cristina Fernández, hasta que, como se verá a continuación, tuvo lugar un cambio radical en la política del gobierno nacional vinculado -y así se sostiene en la presente denuncia- a la decisión de la Sra. Presidente, instrumentada especialmente por su Canciller Héctor Marcos Timerman, juntamente con terceros, de avanzar en un plan encubridor que permita a los imputados de nacionalidad iraní eludir y/o sustraerse de la acción de la justicia, a efectos de facilitar un acercamiento geolpolítico e intercambios comerciales a nivel estatal con la República Islámica de Irán, siendo éstos -a juzgar por la prueba reunida- los principales pero no los únicos motivos. Debe quedar claro que no se está cuestionando un cambio de política exterior -resorte exclusivo del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional y por lo tanto, tema no judiciable-, sino que se denuncia que se haya optado lisa y llanamente por el camino del delito, para borrar una acusación y una investigación judicial en pleno trámite. IV.	- El plan de encubrimiento de los imputados iraníes en la causa AMIA La Sra. Presidente de la Nación, Cristina Fernández, decidió restablecer relaciones interestatales con Irán. Sabía que para hacerlo plenamente, sin restricciones, debía encausar de algún modo la causa AMIA, que estaba pendiente desde hace años, obstruyendo la agenda bilateral, en virtud de las capturas ordenadas, ratificadas y nunca concretadas. Para abordar y resolver este tema, la Dra. Fernández, junto a su Canciller, Héctor Timerman, orquestaron y ejecutaron un plan delictivo destinado a garantizar la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iraníes, desvinculándolos fraudulentamente de la pesquisa, y redireccionando la investigación hacia una pista falsa, con otros imputados. Para ello, mantuvieron negociaciones ocultas con representantes iraníes, por más de un año y medio, a los que se sumaron otros cuatro meses de negociaciones oficiales. Estas tratativas culminaron en la firma del “Memorando de Entendimiento”, suscripto en enero de 2013, una pieza central del plan criminal, dado que sus disposiciones contienen distintos recursos y mecanismos aptos para viabilizar el encubrimiento, con la apariencia de legalidad que la maniobra requiere para ser efectiva. Irán fue atraído al plan, y así se probará a continuación, por la promesa del Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores argentino de permitir la baja de las notificaciones rojas que pesaban y pesan sobre cinco de sus nacionales. Ello, y así lo indican varios elementos, fue acordado secretamente por Timerman y Salehi por fuera del texto del acuerdo. La frustración de este objetivo, por la intervención de terceros ajenos a la maniobra -Interpol-, desalentó la predisposición iraní hacia el tema, sin que ello impeda el avance del plan criminal por parte de las autoridades argentinas denunciadas, que siguió operativo. Precisamente, en este punto se analizará de forma completa, el plan de impunidad llevado adelante, que incluye: la decisión de encubrir, la predisposición de ciertas autoridades ejecutivas argentinas a abandonar el reclamo de justicia, la negociación secreta con Irán y los intentos por mantenerla oculta, la negociación pública cuyo contenido también se mantuvo en secreto, el interés por el petróleo iraní, las razones geopolíticas de realineamiento con Teherán, la prometida aquiescencia de Timerman para el cese de las notificaciones rojas, la existencia de compromisos secretos por fuera del Memorando y el armado de una falsa hipótesis alternativa para desplazar las acusaciones judiciales contra los iraníes. Ministerio Público de la Nación ""^Tlberto nis^an FISCAL GENERAL Asimismo, se examinará en detalle el texto del Memorando de Entendimiento y se demostrará cómo sus disposiciones viabilizan ciertos aspectos del plan criminal. a)	La decisión de encubrir: Naturalmente, la decisión de la Presidente Fernández de restablecer relaciones con la República Islámica de Irán no es cuestionable judicialmente. Aquí no se denuncia ni es materia de crítica el cambio en el enfoque político de una cuestión por parte del gobierno o sus funcionarios, ni tampoco el giro en el modo de relacionarse intemacionalmente ante un conflicto y/o con otros estados. Ni siquiera se denuncia ni mucho menos se cuestiona el mero hecho de entablar negociaciones con la República Islámica de Irán en particular, ya sean comerciales o aún respecto a la causa AMIA. Está claro que todas estas cuestiones y acciones corresponden al ámbito exclusivo y excluyente del Poder Ejecutivo que, por ejercer la jefatura suprema de la Nación, la jefatura de gobierno y la administración general del país, cuenta con la potestad constitucional de concluir y firmar tratados y celebrar negociaciones para el mantenimiento de las buenas relaciones con naciones extranjeras (art. 99 inc. 1 y 11 de la Constitución Nacional). Nada de esto está en discusión. La decisión de poner en marcha una negociación con las autoridades iraníes o el mismo hecho de arribar a un acuerdo con ese gobierno, constituyen -en principio- la concreción de una estrategia y de una acción de política exterior de carácter discrecional y de exclusivo resorte del órgano ejecutivo, cuyo ejercicio escapa al control judicial. Ahora, si bien es cierto que la materia, oportunidad y conveniencia de lo actuado resulta ajena al conocimiento de los jueces, el Poder Judicial se encuentra obligado a intervenir cuando la ejecución de ciertos actos, aún dentro de las competencias asignadas constitucionalmente, conlleve la comisión de delitos. En otras palabras, si la negociación solamente hubiera excedido los límites constitucionales en razón a la competencia de los poderes del estado, alcanzaría con la sanción de inconstitucionalidad. Pero aquí hay algo más serio. Se trata de una acción que no solamente es inconstitucional, sino delictiva, toda vez que los actos realizados, destinados a encubrir a los imputados por este atentado, configuran conductas reprimidas por el derecho penal argentino. En consecuencia, detrás de un objetivo que puede considerarse legítimo, como el restablecimiento de relaciones plenas y comerciales con Irán, y más allá de que hayan sido las autoridades competentes las que intervinieron en el acercamiento, resulta penalmente cuestionable suprimir mediante maniobras delictivas el objetivo de alcanzar la justicia en el atentado más sangriento perpetrado en territorio argentino. El momento en que la Sra. Presidente tomó la determinación delictiva de ayudar a los imputados iraníes a eludir la actuación de la justicia debe situarse entre fines del mes de octubre de 2010 y el mes de enero de 2011. Varias razones convergen en ubicar temporalmente la decisión entre esas fechas. Existen dos hechos, datados en agosto y septiembre de 2010, que indican que hasta esas fechas, no se habían registrado cambios en el rumbo de la política argentina en tomo al caso AMIA, esto es, la decisión de encubrir aún no había sido tomada. El primero de estos hechos tuvo lugar el día 11 de agosto de 2010,	cuando el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores Timerman mantuvo una reunión con la Secretaria de Estado de Estados Unidos. En esa ocasión, la Sra. Hillary Clinton destacó la cooperación mutua entre ambos países en la lucha contra el terrorismo y señaló que su nación apoyaba el reclamo de justicia argentino por los deplorables y trágicos atentados terroristas sufridos (Declaraciones de la Secretaria de Estado Hillary Rodham Clinton con el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Argentina Héctor Timerman, 11/08/2010, Departamento de Estado, Estados Unidos). Luego de la conferencia de prensa brindada junto a la Secretaria Clinton y consultado sobre la relación con Irán, Timerman declaró: “tenemos una situación muy compleja. Hemos obtenido pruebas ALBERTO NISMA FISCAL GENERAL sobre la participación de ciertos funcionarios iraníes en el ataque contra la embajada judía  en Buenos Aires. Interpol aceptó estas pruebas y hemos pedido su captura....La Argentina no busca ninguna operación de ningún tipo que no sea la justicia. Queremos una solución de este problema gravísimo''' (“Timerman aseguró que el diálogo EEUU-UNASUR es posible y deseable”, Prensa Argentina, 11/08/2010; Barón, Ana. “Timerman, con Hillary: apoyo por Irán y diferencias por Honduras”, Clarín, 12/08/10).- A1 respecto, se reportó también que la Secretaria de Estado Norteamericana “reiteró el apoyo de su país a la Argentina en su reclamo a Irán de que entregue a los sospechosos de un atentado contra la mutual judía AMIA” y que puntualmente respaldó “...el pedido de captura de los seis iraníes (incluyendo al actual ministro de defensa iraní Ahmad Vahidi) y un libanés...” (“Hillary apoyó el pedido argentino a Irán por atentado a la AMIA”, Clarín, 11/08/2010; Barón, Ana. “Timerman, con Hilary: apoyo por Irán y diferencias por Honduras”, Clarín, 12/08/10).- Sobre ese mismo tema, tiempo antes de que se inicien los contactos directos y secretos con los iraníes, Timerman declaró: “...pude conectar que un atentado que se frustró en Estados Unidos al aeropuerto JFK involucraba a Mohsen Rabbani, el que era agregado cultural de la embajada de Irán en Buenos Aires. No lo sabía ni Hillary Clinton ni la gente que investiga acá. Ahora hay una conexión entre un atentado que se frustró en Estados Unidos y el de la AMIA...'''' (Cibeira, Fernando. “Hay que relacionarse sin intermediarios” Reportaje a Héctor Timerman, Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Página 12, 9/01/2011). Es decir, hasta aquel momento, Héctor Timerman lucía comprometido, desde su posición política de canciller, con la acusación judicial contra los imputados iraníes y con la tarea de sumar apoyo internacional al reclamo argentino de justicia. El segundo hecho destacable corresponde a lo ocurrido el 24 de septiembre de 2010, cuando la Sra. Presidente se dirigió -tal como anualmente lo viene haciendo- a la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas y, en relación al tema AMIA, ofreció a la República Islámica de Irán la posibilidad de elegir, de común acuerdo, un tercer país donde llevar a cabo el enjuiciamiento de los ciudadanos iraníes acusados por el atentado, con la participación de observadores internacionales (Discurso de Cristina Fernández en la 65° Asamblea General de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2010). La respuesta de Irán a la propuesta argentina llegó cuatro días después. En una misiva dirigida al Presidente de la Asamblea General, el Representante Permanente de la República Islámica de Irán ante Naciones Unidas, Embajador Mohammad Khazaee, reiteró -una vez más- la histórica postura de Irán en torno a este caso (Carta de fecha 28 de septiembre de 2010 dirigida al Presidente de la Asamblea General por el Representante Permanente de la República Islámica de Irán ante Naciones Unidas, Mohammad Khazaee, A/65/495, distribuida el 6/10/10).- Es decir, mientras las autoridades políticas argentinas aún intentaban avanzar en su reclamo de justicia, quizás con un ofrecimiento menos ambicioso, la diplomacia iraní literalmente invertía el eje de la cuestión, en línea con su histórica retórica, acusando a la Argentina de no querer cooperar y de apoyar al terrorismo. Hasta ese momento, no se observaron hechos ni indicios de peso que permitan sospechar que, solapadamente, ya se había decidido y avanzado en el plan de impunidad. El 27 de octubre de 2010 falleció el ex Presidente Néstor Kirchner. El dato no es anecdótico. Se ha consignado para hacer notar que en un momento casi contemporáneo a este hecho, la causa AMIA dejó de ser una “política de estado” para convertirse en un fusible de ajuste. Una pieza descartable. Y lo grave del caso es que para ello altos funcionarios del gobierno argentino, entre otros partícipes, recurrieron a conductas delictivas. ALBERTO NISMAN FISCAL GENERAL a. 1 ) La cumbre de A lepo: En efecto, el primer indicio conocido y relevante que reflejó la decisión de avanzar con el plan encubridor aquí denunciado se registró tan solo tres meses después de la muerte de Néstor Kirchner. Sucedió en enero de 2011 cuando el canciller argentino se separó de la comitiva presidencial que acompañaba a la Presidente Fernández en una gira por Emiratos Árabes Unidos, Kuwait, Qatar y Turquía, para desviarse a fin de asistir a unas reuniones en la República Árabe Siria (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130911/130913). Concretamente, el 23 de enero de 2011, Timerman arribó a Damasco, donde se reunió con el canciller sirio Walid al-Mohalem. Posteriormente, viajó a Alepo, donde se entrevistó con el Presidente Bashar Al-Assad. Extrañamente, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación no emitió ningún comunicado de prensa que diera cuenta del encuentro de nuestro Canciller con el Presidente sirio Al-Assad y con su Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, a pesar de la trascendencia histórica de semejante acercamiento y de la extraña circunstancia de que se reúnan dos funcionarios de disímil jerarquía, como son un Presidente y un Canciller. (“Argentina y Siria fortalecieron las relaciones”, Télam, 25/01/2011; “Encuentro entre el Presidente de Siria Bashar Al-Assad y el canciller argentino Héctor Timerman”, Prensa Islámica, Fuente:	SANA, 24/01/2011). Sin embargo, un cable público de la agencia oficial de noticias Siria -SANA- informó que, con fecha 23 de enero de 2011, el canciller sirio se había reunido con sus pares de Argentina y de Irán, uno después del otro, y que al día siguiente ambos cancilleres viajaron a la ciudad de Alepo, donde se entrevistaron con el Presidente Al-Assad. Según la citada agencia de noticias, Timerman y Al-Assad abordaron cuestiones relativas al fortalecimiento del intercambio económico y científico entre ambos países, al proceso de paz en Medio Oriente y a las relaciones de los países árabes y latinoamericanos (“Encuentro entre el Presidente de Siria Bashar Al-Assad y el canciller argentino Héctor Timerman”, Prensa Islámica, Fuente: SANA, 24/01/2011). Similar información hizo circular la agencia oficial de noticias argentina TÉLAM (“Argentina y Siria fortalecieron las relaciones”, Télam, 25/1/2011). Distintos elementos probatorios hoy corroboran que el entonces Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Irán, Ali Akbar Salehi participó secretamente de aquella cumbre (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). Según el periodista Gabriel Levinas, quien refirió haber accedido a “fuentes oficiosas de la cancillería de IsraeY’: “...A dicha reunión asistieron, la delegación argentina que acompañó a Timerman, integrada por el Embajador Ahuad y dos funcionarios de inteligencia argentina; de la parte siria, el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores Mohalem y el Presidente Bashar Al Assad. Pero, a diferencia de lo informado por los medios en ese momento, al encuentro también asistieron en representación de Irán, el diplomático Walid Almohalem y el ministro de relaciones exteriores, Ali Akbar Salehi. Pasada la parte introductoria en la que todos participaron, la conversación de poco más de una hora, derivó en un mano a mano entre Salehi y Timerman para tratar el tema principal... ” (Levinas, Gabriel, El Pequeño Timerman, Editorial B, Grupo Zeta, Buenos Aires, 2013, pags. 244 y 281). Por otra parte, Levinas agregó que, según pudo reconstruir de las fuentes israelíes, Timerman habría asegurado: “...Yo estoy aquí bajo precisas órdenes de nuestra presidenta para tratar de encontrar o buscar una solución a la causa AMIA. Los tiempos y humores de nuestro país es un tema que resolveremos internamente...'’’’ (Levinas, Gabriel, op.cit., pags. 246 y 281). ALBERTO NISMA Ministerio Público de la Nación	fiscal general Dos meses después de ocurrido el encuentro, la noticia sobre la reunión de Alepo llegó a la sociedad argentina a través de la prensa. Un artículo publicado por el periodista José Eliaschev informaba acerca de la reunión secreta y de distintas cuestiones relativas a la misma (Pepe Eliaschev, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913). Esta primicia fue profundizada en una segunda nota, días después, en el mismo medio gráfico (Pepe Eliaschev, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). Bajo juramento, el Sr. José Ricardo Eliaschev declaró haber accedido a una copia de un documento secreto redactado por el Ministro Salehi, y dirigido al entonces Presidente iraní Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, que narraba datos y conclusiones de ese encuentro. Fundamentalmente, como se analizará más adelante, Salehi informó a su presidente que el gobierno de Cristina Fernández se encontraba dispuesto a suspender de hecho las investigaciones de los ataques terroristas sufridos en 1992 y en 1994, con tal de avanzar en el terreno comercial (fs. 131.189/131.194 y ver: Pepe Eliaschev, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913 y Pepe Eliaschev, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). Y	como si estos elementos no fueran suficientes, el propio Alí Akbar Salehi reconoció posteriormente que las negociaciones con Timerman principiaron dos años antes de firmar el “Memorando de Entendimiento”, lo que literalmente ubica el inicio de las mismas en enero de 2011, esto es, justamente, para la reunión de Alepo. Así, las declaraciones del canciller iraní corroboran las pruebas aquí señaladas y zanjan toda duda sobre el momento en que se iniciaron las negociaciones (“Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/2/13; “FM: Irán, Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, Irán Daily Brief, 14/2/13; “El Canciller de Irán dice que negoció durante dos años el acuerdo con Argentina”, Clarín, 12/02/2013; “Salehi: Irán Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, IRNA, 12/02/2013). En efecto, la secreta cumbre de Alepo fue llevada a cabo entre los cancilleres argentino e iraní, y el Presidente y el Canciller sirios no solo actuaron como “intermediarios” del acercamiento sino también como “pantalla” para mantener oculta la existencia de aquel contacto. Por todo lo expuesto, la cumbre de Alepo -sobre la base de la evidencia detallada- marca el primer indicio concreto y corroborado que da cuenta de la existencia de una decisión de los más altos funcionarios denunciados del gobierno argentino de abandonar la legítima pretensión de enjuiciar a los acusados iraníes judicialmente imputados por el caso AMIA para posibilitar, entre otros objetivos, intercambios comerciales directos a nivel estatal, aun cuando ello implicara desplegar un plan para encubrir a estos imputados. Según las pruebas halladas hasta el momento, aquella decisión fue comunicada secretamente a las autoridades iraníes por el mismísimo canciller Timerman en Alepo en enero de 2011. a.	2) La predisposición a abandonar el reclamo de justicia por el caso AMIA: Tanto secreto reflejaba la necesidad de esconder algo. Se pretendía ocultar la predisposición de la Dra. Fernández a sacrificar el caso AMIA con tal de acercarse geopolíticamente a Irán y avanzar en relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado con Teherán, tal como lo comunicó el Canciller Timerman a su par iraní. Así surge del documento al que, bajo juramento, declaró hacer accedido el Sr. Eliaschev, y mediante el cual Salehi informó de lo ocurrido en esa cumbre secreta al Presidente Ahmadinejad. En efecto, el testigo Eliaschev declaró que el citado instrumento secreto, redactado por el Ministro Salehi con posterioridad a la reunión de Alepo, ha circulado por las cancillerías de varios países. En este reporte, se informaba que “/a Argentina ya no está más interesada en   ALBERTO NISMa/ FISCAL GENERAL-' resolver aquellos dos atentados, pero que en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones económicas con Irán”. En otras palabras, el gobierno argentino había renunciado a llevar ante la justicia a los funcionarios iraníes imputados y presentaba una expectativa por multiplicar los intercambios comerciales entre ambos países (fs. 131.189/131.194 y ver: Pepe Eliaschev, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913 y Pepe Eliaschev, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011).- A1 declarar ante el suscripto, el testigo aclaró que “la revelación de las reuniones” llegaron a sus manos en idioma inglés, no en farsi, y por constataciones propias, revestían total verosimilitud. Asimismo, precisó que dicho informe contenía las recomendaciones del canciller al presidente de Irán (fs. 131.189/131.194).- También explicó que el citado informe “no se trata de un cable como se lo llama en la jerga periodística”, sino que consiste en “un informe de la cancillería iraní al presidente Ahmadinejad, un típico 'paper' intergubernamental, donde el responsable de las relaciones exteriores del régimen de ese país le sugiere al presidente que en virtud de los elementos de juicio que maneja la cancillería iraní corresponde avanzar en un acuerdo importante con la Argentina por que... están dadas las condiciones para que los argentinos decidan dar vuelta de página...” (fs. 131.189/131.194). Está claro que ningún canciller cometería la imprudencia de formular a su presidente tamaña aseveración de no encontrarse completamente seguro de la información transmitida, lo que constituye una evidencia más que el canciller Timerman efectivamente comunicó a Teherán la predisposición a abandonar la investigación judicial del caso AMIA. De allí, la conclusión iraní -volcada en el documento- sobre la exitosa estrategia de negar las acusaciones en su contra que, a la luz de lo ocurrido en Alepo, rendía sus frutos. En este instrumento, la Cancillería persa concluyó que si las acusaciones judiciales eran dejadas de lado, ambos países podían encarar una nueva etapa vincular y destacaba lo propicio de esta oportunidad, dado el paso del tiempo, la poca relevancia de los casos en la opinión pública actual y, fundamentalmente, la conveniencia del rotundo cambio de postura del gobierno argentino. No obstante ello, los funcionarios iraníes sabían que debían operar asumiendo que el gobierno argentino jamás podría admitir públicamente el retroceso que significaba este acercamiento y, menos aún, la predisposición a dejar de lado el histórico reclamo. Ahora bien, todos los hechos y verificaciones posteriores no hacen más que darle la razón a lo expresado por el Sr. Eliaschev. Las circunstancias constatadas desde entonces ratifican lo expresado por el testigo en relación con el documento al que tuvo acceso. Tan es esto así que, justamente, la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento entre ambos países es la expresión final de lo que anticipaba el “paper” de Salehi. Las más altas autoridades del gobierno argentino estaban dispuestas a dejar de lado su propio reclamo de justicia en beneficio de extranjeros prófugos. El acuerdo conduce a la impunidad de los acusados iraníes. Por un lado, se previo expresamente la incorporación en su letra de mecanismos sumamente intrincados que pudieran tornar inaplicable el convenio, como un modo de garantizar la impunidad. Por otro y ante su eventual implementación, se previo la actuación de la “Comisión de la Verdad”, cuyas conclusiones ya estaban acordadas de antemano y, como surge de la prueba, sería la vía para introducir una nueva hipótesis sobre el atentado, falsa pero verosímil, destinada a desincriminar definitivamente a los imputados iraníes. En suma, las pruebas revelan que existió una iniciativa secreta de ciertas autoridades políticas argentinas destinada a negociar un pacto con Irán para “olvidar” los atentados y reactivar el intercambio comercial a nivel estatal. También ponen al descubierto que esta cuestión no podía ser articulada en forma pública, es decir, los funcionarios argentinos no podían reconocer ni sostener semejante decisión ante la ciudadanía. Teherán lo  ALBERTO NIS  Ministerio Público de la Nación entendía. Había que encontrar, entonces, una forma solapada de poder articular estos intereses. Esto llevaría, eventualmente, a la peculiar redacción del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado a principios de 2013, que no es más que un instrumento y uno de los medios a través de los cuales se lograría la impunidad. a.	3) Indicios de la negociación secreta. A partir de enero de 2011 y hasta fines de septiembre de 2012 los funcionarios argentinos e iraníes negociaron en secreto un acuerdo para destruir las imputaciones de la causa AMIA y brindar impunidad a los prófugos iraníes. No obstante el empeñoso intento para mantener ocultas estas maniobras delictivas, surgió a la luz información y tuvieron lugar episodios que evidenciaron la gestación y el crecimiento del plan criminal, durante ese año y medio de encuentros secretos. Se trata de situaciones de conocimiento público que, examinadas de forma aislada no revelan su verdadero significado, pero que analizadas en conjunto, concatenadamente y a la luz del plan de encubrimiento aquí denunciado cobran su real dimensión, en cuanto demuestran el progreso en el camino del delito así como la cimentación del terreno para hacer público el acercamiento bilateral en el momento más propicio. Cabe aclarar que, si bien no se trata de acciones delictivas per se, estas circunstancias deben ser leídas como manifestaciones que hoy evidencian con claridad el plan delictivo que subrepticiamente se estaba llevando a cabo. Y esa es la única relevancia jurídico-penal de las circunstancias que se mencionarán a continuación. El primer indicio se reveló en la reacción a la noticia publicada por José “Pepe” Eliaschev en el diario Perfil. Cuando, en marzo de 2011, el periodista informó sobre la reunión en Alepo y sobre la decisión de abandonar las acciones judiciales para retomar intercambios comerciales, se generó un importante revuelo en la opinión pública e incluso dentro del gobierno de la Dra. Cristina Fernández. La respuesta no se hizo esperar y estuvo directamente dirigida a desacreditar al portador de la información como una maniobra aviesa de deslegitimación de la versión publicada. En lugar de dar explicaciones que esclarecieran las graves implicancias del trascendido informativo, el Canciller Timerman en persona salió a cuestionar al Sr. Eliaschev, sosteniendo simplemente que los datos publicados eran falsos y tenían por objeto dañar su casi contemporánea visita a Israel. Expresó: “...esa fue una información falsa, fue una operación que se hizo en contra de mis relaciones, o sea de mi viaje a Israel ...Fue el oportunismo de un pseudo-periodista que no vaciló en decir cualquier cosa con tal de ofenderme...'''’ (“Brutal cruce entre Héctor Timerman y Pepe Eliaschev por el pacto con Irán”, Mañana Sylvestre, Radio La Red y Diario Perfil, 20/4/11; el resaltado es propio). A todas luces, se trató de una torpe falacia “ad hominem”, ya que nada dijo acerca de la reunión. Sin embargo, fue la propia contraparte iraní la que terminó por desmentir categóricamente al canciller Timerman. El Ministro Salehi, que había intervenido personalmente en el proceso de negociación, reconoció públicamente, en febrero de 2013, que las negociaciones habían durado dos años. Concretamente expresó: “...nos hemos reunido durante dos años con el canciller Argentino Héctor Timerman''’ (“Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/2/13; “FM: Irán, Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, Irán Daily Brief, 14/2/13; “El Canciller de Irán dice que negoció durante dos años el acuerdo con Argentina”, Clarín, 12/02/2013; “Salehi: Irán Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, IRNA, 12/02/2013). Tal confesión obligó al mendaz canciller argentino a tamizar su primera versión aseverando: “hace dos años que hay un interés de Irán” por tratar el caso. Agregó que no se acordó antes porque “como nunca querían involucrar a la justicia argentina, no había posibilidad de diálogo’’'’ y, finalmente tuvo que reconocer llanamente que “hubo conversaciones, hubo mensajes”. (Piqué, Martín. “Si se lleva adelante el memorándum, se activa la causa y comienza el juicio”, Tiempo Argentino, 17/2/2013). Es decir, no solamente se negó el verdadero motivo de aquel encuentro y se ocultó la negociación que allí principió, sino que cuando estos hechos cobraron estado público a través de la prensa, se decidió cuestionar al periodista responsable de la primicia, como una vía de deslegitimar la información y tornarla inverosímil. Cabe destacar que el testigo Eliaschev declaró bajo juramento de ley haber tenido ante su vista la copia del citado documento, explicando las circunstancias en las que accedió al mismo. Estas críticas a la prensa marcaron el interés por mantener estas negociaciones en la oscuridad. Y no sería la única vez que el Canciller, para desacreditar fuentes en el marco de este plan criminal, en lugar de controvertir los hechos narrados, recurrió al cuestionamiento de quienes comunicaron las circunstancias que el ministro prefería ocultar, como ocurrió con las declaraciones del ex Vice Canciller Roberto García Moritán. Lógicamente el funcionario argentino no podía admitir públicamente que se había renunciado al reclamo de justicia por el caso AMIA para habilitar un acercamiento comercial con la República Islámica de Irán. El segundo indicio tuvo lugar en la víspera del 17° aniversario del atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, cuando la prensa persa informó sobre un comunicado de la cancillería de ese país, fechado en 16 de julio de 2011,	mediante el cual manifestó estar “dispuesta a un diálogo constructivo'1'' y “a cooperar con el gobierno Argentino para que se haga toda la luz en el marco de la ley y del respeto mutuo para ayudar a evitar que la investigación judicial continúe por un camino errado”. Según los trascendidos, el gobierno iraní había expresado su indignación “por el hecho de que la búsqueda de la verdad sobre la acción criminal se haya convertido en objeto de conjuras y juegos políticos” destinado a implicar a Irán, “para desviar el proceso judicial de su camino e impedir que los verdaderos responsables de este crimen caigan en manos de la justicia”. Agregó que “La Cancillería de Irán expresa también su malestar por la continuación de estos hechos por quienes han venido actuando en el Poder Judicial argentino desde aquella época”. (“Irán, dispuesto a cooperar con Argentina por atentado contra AMIA de 1994”, El Comunal, 16/07/2011; “Irán to cooperate over Argentina Jewish Centre bomb”, BBC News, 17/07/11; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in AMIA bombing probe”, Tehran Times, 18/07/2011; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in 1994 bombing inquiry”, BBC News, 18/7/11; “Irán promete ayuda para esclarecer el caso AMIA”, La Nación, 17/07/11; Eliaschev, Pepe. “Las condiciones que pone Irán para dialogar”, Perfil, 23/7/11).- Cabe destacar que, en aquel momento, el ofrecimiento de cooperación apareció, al menos para la sociedad argentina, totalmente fuera de contexto. De un día para el otro Irán se decía dispuesto a cooperar sin motivo o razón alguna que justifique dicho paso. Hoy se comprende que se trataba de un gesto expresado en el marco de las negociaciones que se estaban llevando a cabo en forma secreta. En respuesta a ello, el 17 de julio, la cancillería argentina emitió un comunicado por el que hacía saber que había tomado conocimiento, a través de la prensa, del anuncio de la cancillería iraní y que esperaba “recibir la comunicación oficial de su par irán?"" en relación con el ofrecimiento de cooperación. El comunicado argentino agregó que “de confirmarse lo publicado significaría un avance inédito y muy positivo de las autoridades de la República Islámica de Irán en la causa AMIA”. Y finalizaba diciendo “La Argentina ratifica que la ley y la justicia son el único camino que deben seguir las sociedades y sus gobiernos para combatir el terrorismo internacional” (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N°336/l 1 “Respuesta del gobierno argentino ante el anuncio de cooperación del gobierno iraní en la causa AMIA”, 17/7/11; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in AMIA bombing probe”, Tehran Times, 18/07/2011; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in 1994 bombing inquiry”, BBC News, 18/7/11; “AMIA: promesa iraní para el aniversario”, Ámbito Financiero, 18/7/11).   Ministerio Público de la Nación Así, si bien las autoridades argentinas mantuvieron cierto ambiguo respaldo oficial a la justicia nacional como vía obligada de tratamiento de esta cuestión, nada respondieron, a contramano de lo que venía ocurriendo hasta entonces, a las afirmaciones iraníes que sugerían que las conclusiones judiciales argentinas estaban sesgadas por intereses políticos, que constituían un camino equivocado y que la ayuda prometida por Irán tenía por objeto modificar esa trayectoria y reencausar la investigación hacia otra hipótesis que tuviera otros imputados, desincriminando a Irán del caso. En otras palabras, Irán repetía su retórica de siempre. No estaba ofreciendo allanarse a los pedidos de cooperación emanados de la justicia nacional ni mucho menos a detener a los prófugos que ha mantenido resguardados en su territorio, sino que se ofrecía a colaborar en el redireccionamiento de la investigación hacia otra hipótesis, en la que - obviamente- Irán no estuviera involucrado. La respuesta del gobierno argentino no tomó razón de esta circunstancia como así tampoco de las palabras de descrédito hacia la justicia nacional y nada objetó al respecto. Al contrario, pareció apoyarlas de manera inédita en ese entonces. De hecho, a pesar de la elocuente descalificación a la actuación de la justicia argentina, y lejos de exigir -como otrora lo hiciera la cancillería de nuestro país ante este tipo de expresiones- rectificación por la implicancia de lo dicho, el Canciller Timerman manifestó que la propuesta “sería un avance inédito y muy positivo” (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N°336/ll, 17/07/2011). Hoy queda evidenciado que se estaba preparando el terreno para el encubrimiento de un crimen de lesa humanidad. Y	corresponde agregar aquí una reflexión: ¿qué sucedió con aquel ofrecimiento de cooperación de Irán? Previsiblemente, nada. Quedó simplemente en palabras vacías, como siempre ha ocurrido con Irán en esta causa. Debe hacerse notar, además, que a propósito de aquella oferta iraní, la Unidad Fiscal que el suscripto dirige reenvió dos nuevos exhortos a la República Islámica de Irán consignando en su texto el ofrecimiento de colaboración de las autoridades iraníes como una manera de capitalizar en beneficio de la investigación la declamada predisposición a cooperar. Nunca los respondieron (fs. 1179 del Legajo 415 y fs. 6416 del Legajo 392). Lamentablemente, ahora se constata que todo se trató de una puesta en escena para seguir avanzando con el plan de impunidad que en aquellos tiempos se gestaba. El tercer indicio ocurrió dos meses más tarde, en ocasión de la apertura de la 66° Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, el 22 septiembre del año 2011. Por primera vez desde 2009, la Sra. Presidente instruyó al entonces Embajador argentino ante dicha organización, Jorge Argüello, para que permanezca en su asiento mientras pronunciaba su discurso el, en aquel tiempo, Presidente de la República Islámica, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Ello, en contraste con la decisión sostenida por la mandataria en los años previos, de retirar a la delegación argentina del piso y no presenciar los discursos de Ahmadinejad (“La AMIA reclamó que la delegación argentina abandone la ONU cuando hable el presidente de Irán”, La Prensa, 11/09/2012; Mindez, Leonardo, “AMIA: Con otro gesto oficial se confirmó el giro ante Irán”, Clarín, 23/09/2011; Levinas, Gabriel, op.cit., pags. 173, 189, 208, 20 y 279). Semejante signo comunicacional resulta menos críptico si se lo contextualiza en el marco de las negociaciones que estaban manteniendo secretamente ambos países. Como ya se sostuvo, no se cuestiona la decisión política de la Sra. Presidente de ordenar al embajador argentino ante la ONU que permanezca en su asiento escuchando el discurso del primer mandatario iraní. Simplemente, es mencionado en este punto por tratarse de un indicio importante de la existencia de las negociaciones entonces secretas. El cuarto indicio tuvo lugar, ya en el mes de septiembre de 2012, cuando -por primera vez en años- Presidencia de la Nación decidió no   Ministerio Público de la Nación invitar a formar parte de la comitiva argentina que viajó a la 67a Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas a ninguno de los dirigentes comunitarios de las instituciones judías locales. Así lo reconoció uno de ellos: “...el último año no hemos sido invitados, lamentablemente. Y es cuando surge justamente la propuesta de esta mesa de diálogo por parte de la Presidenta de la Nación...” (Borger, Guillermo. Versión taquigráfica del plenario de comisiones en el Honorable Senado de la Nación del 13 de febrero de 2013). Este dato resulta sumamente llamativo si se tiene en cuenta que - justamente- en esa oportunidad, la Dra. Fernández anunció oficialmente su decisión de “iniciar” un diálogo con Irán en torno al caso AMIA. La existencia de negociaciones y acuerdos previos con Irán y el conocimiento anticipado del anuncio que se haría, debieron motivar la decisión de no sumar a la dirigencia comunitaria judía a la comitiva. Esto demuestra, como las demás pruebas lo corroboran, que la Sra. Presidente mintió al sostener que en ese momento se iniciaban las negociaciones. No sería la única mentira ni la más grave. Es decir, durante el transcurso de las negociaciones secretas, de enero de 2011 a septiembre de 2012, existieron señales de cambio que, hoy se entiende, respondían al acercamiento entre funcionarios de ambos países y -fundamentalmente- al plan criminal que se había gestado, cuyo objetivo final era brindar impunidad a los acusados prófugos y vaciar de contenido la imputación del suscripto y del Sr. Juez que obtuvo un fuerte y decisivo respaldo internacional en las sucesivas votaciones de Interpol. En síntesis, pese a que las autoridades del gobierno argentino involucradas en el encubrimiento de los imputados iraníes, con toda lógica, intentaron mantener bajo estricto secreto las negociaciones que estaban llevando adelante con los funcionarios persas, fueron surgiendo a la luz varios indicios que claramente se erigieron en señales de la existencia de dichas tratativas. En efecto, trascendió a la prensa la reunión secreta que Héctor Timerman mantuvo en Alepo y el canciller argentino cuestionó duramente al periodista que difundió la noticia. De un día para el otro y sin justificativo alguno, en julio de 2011, Irán se declaró dispuesto a negociar en relación al atentado. El gobierno argentino presenciaba por intermedio de su embajador, después de dos años, el discurso del Presidente Ahmadinejad ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas. La Presidente Fernández no invitó a las instituciones comunitarias judías, como había sido su costumbre, a formar parte de la comitiva que la acompañó a la siguiente reunión anual de las Naciones Unidas y justamente, en esa oportunidad, anunció una negociación con la República Islámica de Irán en relación al ataque terrorista del 18 de julio de 1994. ¿Pueden todos estos signos ser tomados simplemente como frutos de la casualidad? El sentido común indica que no, pero son las pruebas a las que se ha accedido las que confirman que todos estos gestos se debieron al acercamiento secreto que había ocurrido entre las partes y cuyo objetivo final fue brindar impunidad a los acusados iraníes prófugos. a.	4) Negociación Pública. El 25 de septiembre de 2012, la Sra. Presidente de la Nación, Cristina Fernández, anunció ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas que había instruido a su canciller Héctor Timerman, para que inicie un proceso de negociación con Irán en torno al caso AMIA. Oficialmente se comunicó que esta decisión respondía a un pedido articulado por Irán siete días antes de la apertura del Debate General de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, Comunicado de Prensa N°302, 18/09/2012). Sin embargo, como ya se probó, los elementos aquí obtenidos demuestran que eso fue solo una puesta en escena, dado que las partes estaban negociando desde hacía más de un año. Ello se desprende de lo analizado en los puntos anteriores. Así, “...Cristina y su canciller solo estaban oficializando un hecho consumado...” (Ver: Levinas, Gabriel, op cit, pag. 237). Ello también se sustenta tanto en lo testificado por el Sr. Eliaschev como en lo declarado públicamente por el propio Canciller Salehi, que demuestra que el “inicio” de las negociaciones anunciado por la Dra. Fernández y su Canciller en septiembre de 2012 fue sencillamente falso (“Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/2/13; “FM: Irán, Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, Irán Daily Brief, 14/2/13; “El Canciller de Irán dice que negoció durante dos años el acuerdo con Argentina”, Clarín, 12/02/2013; “Salehi: Irán Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, IRNA, 12/02/2013; fs. 131.189/131.194; Pepe Eliaschev, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Pepe Eliaschev, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011; Eliaschev, Pepe. “Las condiciones que pone Irán para dialogar”, Perfil, 23/7/11). Por otra parte, para el diario The Tehran Times, la negociación entre Argentina e Irán había comenzado incluso un tiempo antes que la cumbre de Alepo, a mediados de 2010, a partir de una serie de reuniones secretas entre funcionarios de ambos gobiernos “...parapreparar el terreno para la firma del memorándum de entendimiento...” (Soroush, M. “Irán and Argentina deal a serious blow to zionists”, Tehran Times, 23/02/2013; Levinas, Gabriel, op cit, pag. 238; “La prensa iraní afirma que la negociación con Argentina empezó en 2010”, La Nación, 24/02/2013); circunstancia que también mencionó el Sr. Eliaschev en sus notas periodísticas (Pepe Eliaschev, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011). Ahora bien, lo cierto fue que el 25 de septiembre de 2012 en Naciones Unidas, la Dra. Fernández decidió oficializar las negociaciones con la República Islámica de Irán. Naturalmente, nada dijo del año y medio de tratativas secretas que tuvieron lugar entre enero de 2011 y septiembre de 2012. Lo que sí aseveró a las víctimas y a los familiares de las víctimas fue: “tengan la certeza de que esta Presidenta no va a tomar ninguna resolución respecto de ninguna propuesta que le sea formulada, sin consultar PREVIAMENTE con quienes han sido las víctimas directas de esto. Y, al mismo tiempo también, con las fuerzas políticas con representación parlamentaria en mi país, porque esto no lo puede decidir una sola fuerza política...” (Discurso de Cristina Fernández ante la 67a Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, de fecha 25 de septiembre de 2012,	el resaltado es propio). Sin embargo y pese a haberse comprometido públicamente a consultarlos previo a tomar cualquier resolución, nada de eso ocurrió y luego de tres reuniones con los funcionarios iraníes en Suiza, con fecha 27 de enero de 2013, se dio a conocer en Adís Abeba, Reino de Etiopía, la suscripción del “Memorándum de Entendimiento entre el Gobierno de la República Argentina y el Gobierno de la República Islámica de Irán sobre los temas vinculados al ataque terrorista a la sede de la AMIA en Buenos Aires el 18 de julio de 1994” (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información para la Prensa N° 011/13, 27/01/2013). La firma del acuerdo dejó en evidencia que la Sra. Presidente faltó a su palabra. Más adelante se verá que esta promesa incumplida no es solo moralmente reprochable -lo cual no es relevante en términos judiciales-, sino que -y esto sí importa- ha sido una acción especialmente destinada a contribuir con el avance del plan delictivo denunciado. La Sra. Presidente comunicó este acuerdo a través de su cuenta oficial de “Twitter”, un día domingo, coincidente con el “Día Internacional de Conmemoración en Memoria de las Víctimas del Holocausto”. Y al hacerlo, lo calificó de un hecho “histórico” (Mensajes de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 de horas: 10:26 a 10:32). En ese sentido, las autoridades de la AMIA hablaron de un “memorando inconsulto” y señalaron que: “la propuesta aparece firmada, un hecho del que no hemos sido informados”, “este memorando nos sorprende a toda la ciudadanía el pasado 27 de enero, jamás fue consultado, ni siquiera comentado’1'1 (Borger, Guillermo en: “La AMIA  Al BERTO MISM TiSCAL GENERAL advirtió un momento difícil, tras el acuerdo entre Argentina e Irán”, La Nación, 3/2/2013; “Presidente de la AMIA prometió no bajar los brazos y se comprometió a evitar que la causa por el atentado causa en la nulidad”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 4/3/2013). Por su parte, los representantes de la DAIA afirmaron haber tomado conocimiento del acuerdo en el mismo momento que el resto de la opinión	pública y	aclararon que	la institución	no fue	consultada previamente ni participó de la redacción del documento (Schlosser, Julio en: “LA DAIA reconoció que hay un resquemor en la comunidad judía por el acuerdo que la Argentina firmó con Irán”, Itongadol, 4/2/2013). Volviendo al mes de septiembre de 2012 y luego del anuncio presidencial ante Naciones Unidas, la Cancillería Argentina y el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores iraní emitieron un comunicado conjunto que - como se verá- contribuyó a amplificar la mentira presidencial. En ese informe,	ambos ministerios decían	haberse comprometido	a explorar mecanismos legales que no estuvieran en contradicción con los sistemas legales de Argentina e Irán (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información para la Prensa 313/12, 27/09/2012). Es menester adelantar aquí que el resultado de los encuentros diplomáticos no respetó precisamente el sistema legal argentino. Todo lo contrario, en consonancia con lo dictaminado oportunamente por la Unidad Fiscal a mi cargo, el Memorando de Entendimiento vulneró la Constitución Nacional	y normas	internacionales	de Derechos	Humanos de igual jerarquía.	Ello fue	sostenido en el	fallo de la	Cámara	Criminal y Correccional Federal de esta ciudad, que declaró la inconstitucionalidad del pacto y de su ley aprobatoria (CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 “AMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N°6- Secretaría N°ll). Es decir, en contraposición a lo anunciado, el canciller Timerman suscribió un instrumento jurídico en flagrante contradicción con el orden jurídico local. Aclarado ello, cabe agregar que a aquel primer comunicado de prensa le siguieron otros, en los cuales la Cancillería daba cuenta de breves encuentros entre ambas partes, pero nada decía en concreto sobre el contenido del diálogo ni sobre el alcance de las cuestiones negociadas (Comunicados de Prensa del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de fecha 27/9/12 - N°313/12; 29/10/12 -N°353/12-; 31/10/12 - N°360/12-; 1/12/12 - N°391/12; 7/1/13 - N°002/13-). Hasta el día de hoy, las autoridades argentinas no han brindado la más mínima información sobre lo negociado en esos encuentros. Incluso, ante el pedido articulado por el suscripto a solicitud de las instituciones querellantes AMIA (Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina) y DAIA (Delegación de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentina), requiriendo información sobre los encuentros con Teherán, la cartera de Timerman hizo saber “que tratándose de un proceso de negociación diplomática entre Estados las partes han acordado mantener reserva de su contenido mientras dure el mismo” (oficio de fecha 5 de noviembre de 2012 glosado a fs. 132.805 y Nota N°2194 fechada en 8 de noviembre de 2012 de la Carpeta DIAJU N°7102/11, Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto). En realidad, valiéndose de las prerrogativas de secreto propias de la actividad diplomática, ocultándose detrás de la confidencialidad que se le permite a ciertos encuentros, el Canciller Timerman mantuvo en reserva sus tratativas porque no estaba en condiciones de hacerlas públicas. Se estaba negociando un encubrimiento y la publicidad y el control ciudadano era el mayor enemigo. Es un caso más de utilización dual de las funciones diplomáticas para ocultar acciones delictivas destinadas a encubrir al terrorismo. No es nuevo para Teherán ni, evidentemente, para los encubridores en esta maniobra delictiva. En síntesis, tal como lo revelan los hechos aquí enunciados, las tratativas sobre este tema fueron iniciadas en el mayor de los secretos, ocultas detrás de intermediarios y reuniones “pantalla”, y así se mantuvieron durante el siguiente año y medio, hasta que se anunció públicamente el “inicio” del diálogo, cuyo contenido y alcance ha permanecido en reserva. Para impedir que trasciendan, primero la existencia de los contactos y después, su contenido, se recurrió a la negación de los hechos, a su tergiversación y hasta se llegó a cuestionar y desacreditar a las fuentes que brindaban información sobre el tema, como estrategia para impedir -de la forma que fuere necesaria- la verificación de estas circunstancias, sin expedirse sobre los cuestionamientos realizados. Este fue el inicio del plan criminal. Luego se fue perdiendo todo formalismo, si se quiere, para adentrarse en una actividad y conjunto de hechos delictivos de los que la historia judicial argentina no debe registrar muchos antecedentes. Como se verá, son la clara muestra de una impunidad y un uso arbitrario y delictivo del poder estatal pocas veces visto. a)	Los motivos del encubrimiento. Aun cuando la configuración del delito de encubrimiento no exija normativamente la acreditación de los intereses que pudieron haber motivado al sujeto activo a desplegar la conducta típica, dada la sofisticación que reviste este caso, es sumamente ilustrativo explayarse, según los indicios y elementos probatorios obtenidos, sobre aspectos de esta cuestión ya que, a criterio del suscripto, contribuyen a comprender acabadamente el plan criminal aquí denunciado. Quedó ya acreditado que las autoridades argentinas decidieron que resultaba conveniente restablecer relaciones bilaterales plenas con la República Islámica de Irán. Se reitera que sobre ese punto, nada hay para discutir pues, compartida o no, dicha decisión es propia del Poder Ejecutivo y no es materia judiciable. Por otra parte, cabe aclarar que las razones de índole comercial que motivaron a las autoridades argentinas y demás partícipes, exaltadas por la severa crisis energética, se desprenden de los elementos con que se cuenta y por ello, se las considera determinantes de las conductas que se denuncian, pero no únicas. También se cuenta con elementos probatorios que demuestran que existieron razones de índole geopolítica que motivaron el acercamiento con Teherán. Según estas pruebas, se entendió que el actual escenario mundial favorecía la proximidad con Irán e imponía la necesidad de aniquilar la causa AMIA. Por lo demás, no se puede descartar que hayan existido otros motivos alternativos y complementarios a los aquí constatados, que hayan contribuido también a impulsar la decisión y las maniobras de encubrimiento aquí expuestas. En ese caso, la determinación de estas razones concurrentes podrá ser abordada en la investigación aquí propiciada. Ahora bien, la Dra. Cristina Fernández fue lo suficientemente sagaz para advertir, a priori, que esa decisión jamás sería tolerada pacíficamente por la opinión pública argentina debido al pronunciamiento de la justicia nacional sobre la responsabilidad de funcionarios iraníes en el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA. Es decir, acercarse y negociar con el gobierno de un país cuyos funcionarios y ex funcionarios están acusados de participar del más grave atentado perpetrado en territorio nacional, generaría una fuerte polémica si no se abordaba la cuestión pendiente en torno a la causa AMIA antes del inicio de las tratativas comerciales. Presente ello, el modo del que se valió la Sra. Presidente para zanjar esta cuestión espinosa resulta verdaderamente inexplicable y, lo que es central, delictivo. Decidió, lisa y llanamente, obviar el problema. Optó entonces por desconocer lo decidido por la justicia y ordenar la ejecución de un plan de encubrimiento que permita liberar a los prófugos iraníes de toda sospecha, eximiéndolos de responsabilidad penal y garantizándoles impunidad para el futuro. Sin acusación que entorpezca las relaciones, no habría objeciones para avanzar en el terreno comercial a nivel estatal. Existía, entonces, la necesidad de “lavarle la cara” a Irán. Con esta idea en mente, se negoció secretamente un acuerdo de impunidad, aceptando dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol de los cinco imputados iraníes y -como se verá- construyendo, clandestinamente, una hipótesis alternativa que señalara nuevos y falsos acusados para desincriminar a los verdaderos culpables. En ese camino, se realizaron negociaciones secretas y luego públicas, se suscribió el Memorando de Entendimiento, se impulsó velozmente su aprobación en el Congreso Nacional; se mintió a familiares y víctimas del atentado prometiéndoles que serían consultados sobre las propuestas esgrimidas en la negociación; se destinaron agentes del servicio de inteligencia de la Presidencia de la Nación para que “construyan” una falsa pero verosímil hipótesis alternativa a la obtenida judicialmente y basada en las pruebas del caso, recurriendo a un ex fiscal de la causa para que aporte su conocimiento; se estableció un canal de comunicación paralelo con Teherán; se articuló una campaña política y mediática para desacreditar las imputaciones judiciales y se montaron verdaderas actuaciones para disimular el plan criminal. En síntesis, se realizaron un sinfín de conductas que, analizadas globalmente, reflejan tanto el dolo directo de los partícipes de esta maniobra delictiva como la minuciosidad con que el encubrimiento estuvo pensado y ejecutado. a.	1) Un encubrimiento peculiar Las pruebas acumuladas permiten concluir que el acercamiento que llevó a la suscripción del memorando de entendimiento como medio para lograr impunidad, como así también su constante impulso, no ha sido motorizado por Irán, sino que fueron las mencionadas autoridades argentinas las que han venido ejecutando, principalmente, este plan criminal. Esto, como ya se señaló, marca una peculiaridad en la perpetración del delito, dado que, aunque parezca irracional, este encubrimiento ha sido impulsado por el interés del encubridor, más que por el de los sujetos encubiertos. No fueron las autoridades ni los prófugos iraníes quienes cruzaron océanos y desiertos para llegar a la septentrional Alepo en Siria a negociar secretamente un pacto, ofreciendo impunidad, como se probará seguidamente. Por su parte, los hechos revelan que a las autoridades iraníes solo les ha importado lograr el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que pesan sobre cinco de sus nacionales, personas de gran relevancia de la vida política iraní. Habían acusado recibo de la afrenta sufrida cuando el ex Ministro de Defensa, Ahmad Vahidi, debió abandonar territorio boliviano ante la presión generada por la vigencia de la notificación roja en su contra (“Bolivia echó a Ministro de Defensa iraní acusado por atentado en la Argentina”, Infobae.com, 31/5/2011; “Evo expulsó a un funcionario iraní”, Página 12, 1/6/2011; “Bolivia pide disculpas a la Argentina y expulsa a Ministro de Defensa iraní”, El mundo, 1/6/2011). Episodios como estos han obligado al régimen a dotar de inmunidad diplomática a cada uno de los prófugos en cada ocasión en que viajan al exterior. De hecho, en mayo de este año, representantes de la República de Corea consultaron sobre las implicancias de una posible invitación al imputado Mohsen Rezai para que visite dicho país, por lo que se dispuso comunicar inmediatamente a Interpol que, en caso de concretarse la visita, se haga efectiva la orden de captura internacional, con notificación roja, que pesa sobre el nombrado (Oficio del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto del 9/05/2014, Nota n°5572/14; Oficio al Jefe del Departamento Interpol de la Policía Federal Argentina fechado en 12/5/2014). Esto demuestra que, como se dijo, si bien las notificaciones rojas no han conseguido -por el momento- la detención de los imputados, claramente los afectan, dado que continúan siendo un obstáculo que dificulta su movilidad transnacional. Por lo demás, el interés iraní en torno a la ratificación del acuerdo desapareció al no caer las notificaciones rojas, como se había convenido. Nótese que con fecha 10 de marzo de 2013, el Memorando de Entendimiento fue elevado al Parlamento de Irán para su convalidación. Una semana después, el día 15 de marzo, Interpol garantizó la estabilidad de las notificaciones rojas. Al día siguiente, el Canciller Salehi expresó públicamente su disconformidad con lo resuelto por la Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal, al aclarar que, conforme lo convenido, _juÁ ALBERTO NISMAjfi FISCAL GENERAL con la sola firma del acuerdo, Interpol debía hacer cesar las notificaciones rojas. La consecuencia de dicho revés desalentador para Irán fue que el tratado nunca recibió tratamiento parlamentario y pareció quedar fuera de la agenda legislativa iraní. (Pagni, Carlos, “El kirchnerismo, en el peor de los mundos”, La Nación 30/5/13; “El memorandún con Argentina llega al parlamento iraní”, Europa Press, 11/3/2013; Kollmann, Raúl “Con novedades semana a semana”, Página 12, 24/3/13; Nota N°LA/35678-47- 3.1 EGI/tsa, Consejería jurídica, Secretaría General, Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal, 15/3/2013; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado N°044/13 del 15/03/2013; IRNA, “Salehi, Irán y Argentina trabajan conjuntamente para resolver las acusaciones sobre la AMIA”, 18/3/2013; “Irán asegura que el acuerdo con Argentina incluye retirar las “notas rojas” de Interpol”, La Nación, 18/3/2013). Esto demuestra la relevancia que la cuestión de las notificaciones rojas tenía para la parte iraní, lo cual también quedó evidenciado en las palabras del Ministro Salehi, negociador del acuerdo, que dio cuenta de la existencia de acuerdos secretos entre ambos países sobre ese tema, que fueron escondidos y negados por las autoridades argentinas, y cuyo cumplimiento quedó trunco -como lo demuestra la prueba- por la intermediación de Interpol. Ahora bien y volviendo a la peculiaridad de este encubrimiento, cabe destacar que las evidencias revelan una profunda disparidad de intereses entre las autoridades argentinas e iraníes, que también quedó expuesta en las siguientes circunstancias: 1)	El viaje del canciller Héctor Timerman a Alepo, para iniciar secretamente las negociaciones, ofreciendo lo que Teherán siempre pidió: el abandono de las acusaciones contra sus ciudadanos por el mayor hecho de terrorismo sufrido en territorio argentino (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011; Levinas, Gabriel, op. cit., pags. 244, 246 y 281). 2)	El absoluto silencio del gobierno argentino, durante el período de negociaciones públicas y aun luego de haberse firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, frente a las agraviantes declaraciones de funcionarios iraníes, tendientes a descalificar la investigación judicial argentina y/o a las autoridades judiciales que han intervenido en la misma (“Irán volvió a rechazar todas las acusaciones por el atentado a la AMIA”, La Nación, 30/10/2012; Paraszczuk, Joanna, “Irán ready to identify AMIA bombing perpetrators”, Jerusalem Post, 30/10/12; Kollmann, Raúl: “Irán volvió a negar su culpabilidad”, Página 12, 31/10/12; “Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/02/2013; “Irán rechazó las acusaciones del fiscal Alberto Nisman al considerarlo sionista”, La Nación, 3/6/20113; “El ministerio exteriores de Irán: No le damos importancia a las declaraciones de Nisman”, IRNA, 5/6/2013; Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, “Irán rechazó, otra vez, su participación en la AMIA”, Clarín, 19/06/2013; “Irán volvió a criticar al sionismo”, La Nación, 19/06/2013; “Para Irán, la causa AMIA causó amargura en las relaciones entre Irán y Argentina”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 16/07/2013). 3)	La sobreactuación elogiosa del canciller argentino ante un planteo del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores iraní para “colaborar” con la causa, en Julio de 2011, que, como siempre ocurrió con Irán en esta causa, nunca se concretó (“Irán, dispuesto a cooperar con Argentina por atentado contra AMIA de 1994”, El Comunal, 16/07/2011; “Irán to cooperate over Argentina Jewish Centre bomb”, BBC News, 17/07/11; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in AMIA bombing probe”, Tehran Times, 18/07/2011; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in 1994 bombing inquiry”, BBC News, 18/7/11; “Irán promete ayuda para esclarecer el caso AMIA”, La Nación, 17/07/11; Eliaschev, Pepe. “Las condiciones que pone Irán para dialogar”, Perfil, 23/7/11; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N°336/l 1 “Respuesta del gobierno argentino ante el anuncio de cooperación del gobierno iraní en la causa AMIA”, 17/7/11; “AMIA: promesa iraní para el aniversario”, Ambito Financiero, 18/7/11). ALBERTO MIS FISCAL GENEfi^ 4)	La presencia de la legación argentina en la sala de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas durante los discursos del mandatario persa, en septiembre de 2011 y de 2012 (“La AMIA reclamó que la delegación argentina abandone la ONU cuando hable el presidente de Irán”, La Prensa, 11/09/2012; Mindez, Leonardo, “AMIA: Con otro gesto oficial se confirmó el giro ante Irán”, Clarín, 23/09/2011; Levinas, Gabriel, op.cit., pags. 173, 189, 208, 20 y 279). 5)	La rápida ratificación del acuerdo por parte del Congreso Argentino, en contraposición con la aún pendiente aprobación iraní (Sofía Guterman, “Se está haciendo todo lo posible para que Irán salga triunfante de esto”, Radio JAI, 14/02/2013; “Sobre el cruce en el debate por el memorándum: Lo de ayer fue miserable”, La Razón, 14/02/2013; “Familiares de las víctimas del atentado a la AMIA piden participar en el plenario de Diputados”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 22/02/2013; Pagni, Carlos, “El kirchnerismo, en el peor de los mundos”, La Nación 30/5/13; “El memorandún con Argentina llega al parlamento iraní”, Europa Press, 11/3/2013; Kollmann, Raúl “Con novedades semana a semana”, Página 12, 24/3/13). 6)	los posteriores reclamos y propuestas de la Sra. Presidente y del Sr. Canciller, ante la falta de notificación fehaciente de ratificación interna del acuerdo por parte de Irán, además de los públicos pedidos para acelerar la conformación de la comisión creada en el acuerdo y fijar la fecha de las audiencias previstas en el mismo. (“Timerman estimó que en el próximo mes y medio el parlamento iraní aprobará el acuerdo por la AMIA”, Télam, 18/4/13; “Cuánto más tarde Irán en aprobar el memorando, más dudas va a generar”, Ámbito Financiero, 18/4/13; “Ultimátum oficial a Irán: Espero que en un mes aprueben el memorándum”, Infobae, 18/04/2013; “Reclaman a Irán el aval al acuerdo”, Clarín, 19/04/2013; “Timerman confía en que Irán firmará el pacto en un mes”, La Gaceta, 19/04/2013; Discurso de Cristina Fernández, 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2013; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°279/13, Declaración de prensa leída por el Canciller Timerman en Casa Rosada, 24 de noviembre de 2013; Dinatale, Martín, “La negociación con Irán, empantanada por la lista de Interpol”, La Nación, 08/12/2013). 7)	Los aprestos a nivel ministerial para iniciar el intercambio comercial de “petróleo por granos”, deseado y promovido por las autoridades argentinas, ni bien Irán apruebe el acuerdo (Comunicaciones del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l 009-2013-05-20- 133130-8, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-111124-8, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 114842-2, CD 31; Archivo B-l009-2013-05-20- 140034-12, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-143508-24, CD 31; Archivo B-l009-2013-05-20-161759-6, CD 31; del 21/05/2013 abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo 2542, CD 32 y del 28/05/2013, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). 8)	La “puesta en escena” de la diplomacia argentina, perpetrada en septiembre de 2013, intentando mostrar avances específicos en la relación con Irán (ver punto V.b.2). 9)	La construcción de una hipótesis falsa con nuevos autores y pruebas fraudulentas, que desplace a la actual acusación judicial, con el objeto de desinvicular definitivamente a los imputados iraníes (Comunicación del 27/1/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266; Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l 009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43; Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	12-18-183332-8, CD 226; Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-02-14-164341-10, CD 284). En suma, las circunstancias acreditadas a lo largo de toda esta presentación y aquí sucintamente enumeradas, demuestran a las claras que, en este caso, los encubridores se han mostrado mucho más interesados que los encubiertos en avanzar hacia los pasos finales del plan y esto, hoy ya se sabe, guarda relación directa con el hecho de que ha sido el interés de restablecer un comercio de Estado a Estado y de posicionarse geopolíticamente cerca de Teherán, conforme lo decidieron las autoridades Ministerio Público de la Nación AL®,fiTiro NISM FISCAL GENERA1 argentinas aquí involucradas, lo que motivó tanto el acercamiento a negociar como la definición y consecución del plan encubridor. Las conversaciones interceptadas entre los reales negociadores de ambos estados así lo acreditan. a.	2) Pruebas del interés por restablecer relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado Existen numerosas evidencias que demuestran que un fuerte interés subyacente a las probadas acciones criminales direccionadas a garantizar impunidad era, como ya se anunció; restablecer relaciones comerciales al nivel de los estados, como una salida a la grave crisis energética nacional. De hecho, las intervenciones telefónicas dispuestas judicialmente han permitido conocer y probar estas circunstancias, dado que estos temas fueron tratados a través de los canales paralelos de comunicación y negociación establecidos con Teherán, para avanzar con el plan encubridor. Primero. Antes de la firma del acuerdo, cuando nada se sabía de lo que se estaba negociando en Suiza, Fernando Esteche, partícipe de esta maniobra, líder del grupo “Quebracho”, histórico defensor del régimen iraní y allegado a funcionarios del gobierno nacional, aseveró: “...los tipos quieren restablecer relaciones ...que lo van a hacer... multidimensionalmente eso. A nivel gobierno, te digo, a nivel Estado...lo que tiene que ver con establecer relaciones entre los dos Estados...” (Comunicación del 18/12/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Los partícipes del plan estaban al tanto de los intereses subyacentes al acuerdo. Además se evidencia que personajes locales histórica y fuertemente ligados a la República Islámica de Irán, y que, al mismo tiempo, poseen estrechos vínculos con funcionarios del gobierno nacional, ya conocían los intereses del acuerdo que viabiliza la impunidad de los prófugos iraníes. Segundo. Un contacto de Jorge Khalil, el empresario iraní Heshmatollah Rahnema, también estaba al tanto del interés del gobierno argentino por comerciar con Irán. Por dicha razón, se comunicó con Khalil para hacerle saber de su gestión ante la Cámara de Comercio de Teherán, la cual tenía intención de reunirse en Irán con representantes diplomáticos argentinos, para abrir el camino a todas las empresas iraníes, para que éstas comiencen a negociar con Argentina. Este pedido de acercamiento y reunión por parte de grupos económicos iraníes hubiera sido impensado antes del acuerdo por AMIA. Nada tiene de malo el comercio, muy por el contrario, pero resulta delictivo que para viabilizarlo se desarticulen ilegalmente las acusaciones judiciales y se dote de impunidad a los prófugos iraníes. Sobre el particular Rahnema expresó: “...yo ahora necesito a ver si hay una palanca a través de D'Elía...de Cancillería...de Pérsico ...de Fernando*’... porque yo quiero llamar a la Embajada Argentina en Teherán...porque la Cámara de Comercio de Teherán quiere tener una reunión para abrir el camino que todas las empresas privadas directamente ...para llevarlo a la Cámara de Comercio de Teherán, el agregado del negocio de Argentina que están en Teherán...quería llevarlo ahí, para hablar en la Cámara y la Cámara está muy interesada que las empresas privadas...empiezan a arrancar los negocios con Argentina... ’’(Comunicación del 14/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-14-125442-12, CD 0025). Más allá de que Rahnema planteaba un interés relativo a relaciones comerciales entre particulares, Khalil le explicó que había transmitido estas inquietudes a Luis D'Elía, quien, a su vez, se las había comunicado al Diputado Andrés “Cuervo” Larroque, quien lo hablaría con la Sra. Presidente de la Nación (Comunicación del 14/05/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-14-131007-12.wav, CD 0025). Khalil explicó: “...yo fui a hablar con D'Elía y le dije...todas las propuestas y de  FISCAL uENEnAL  la cancillería, de la cancillería también...lo que me había propuesto... Y él lo elevó al ""Cuervo” Larroque...el de ""La Cámpora”, el Jefe de ""La Cámpora”...Y ya iban a hablar con Cristina...” (Comunicación del 14/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-14-131007- 12.wav, CD 0025). Tercero. Pocos días después del regreso de Irán del referente local del régimen, Jorge Khalil, y luego de varias comunicaciones en la que puso al tanto a Luis D'Elía de los mensajes de Teherán, debe mencionarse la secuencia ocurrida a partir del día 15 de mayo de 2013, cuando lo llamaron a Khalil para que se comunique urgente con D'Elía que estaba “en Presidencia”. D'Elía puso la comunicación telefónica en altavoz y aclaró que había un funcionario escuchando: “...yo estoy con una persona amiga, que te está escuchando, que yo no voy a nombrar...”. Seguidamente, hablaron de la posibilidad de que delegaciones de ambos países se reunieran en Caracas, en Beirut o en alguna zona del golfo -como habían propuesto los iraníes- para restablecer las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno. En palabras de Khalil: “...Perfecto...si hay un verdadero interés para empezar y entablar las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno, con funcionario de gobierno de acá, una delegación de allá viajaría o a Caracas o al Golfo o a Beirut mejor...o a alguna zona del golfo...para empezar las relaciones directas de funcionarios a funcionarios...”, a lo cual D'Elía le contestó, dado que su acompañante permaneció en silencio: “Bueno. Ok. Con lo que nosotros queremos... ¿no?”, para, luego, terminar acordando (Comunicaciones del 15/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-100907-10, CD 26; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-101055-4, CD 26). Esos contactos ponen en evidencia que para D'Elía, “nosotros” son ciertas autoridades gubernamentales argentinas, para las que opera y para Khalil, en el mismo contexto, “nosotros” es Irán. Fundamentalmente, queda claro el interés de las altas esferas locales por restablecer el comercio entre ambos Estados. Puede inferirse claramente que Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil está transmitiendo la respuesta de Irán a la solicitud argentina de negociar. Cuarto. El evidente interés comercial que motorizó el plan de impunidad se comprueba de modo contundente en las comunicaciones telefónicas registradas los días 19 y 20 de mayo de 2013, que dan cuenta de la reunión entre Luis D'Elía y el Ministro de Planificación Federal, Inversión Pública y Servicios, Arquitecto Julio De Vido, llevada a cabo por orden de Cristina Fernández. Además, como se verá a continuación, las propuestas comunicadas por el Ministro De Vido, a pedido de la Sra. Presidente, fueron posteriormente puestas a consideración del prófugo iraní Mohsen Rabbani, quien dado su poder político intervino indirectamente en las negociaciones con sus encubridores, participando del encubrimiento que lo tiene por beneficiario. Tan insólito como inaceptable. El día 19 de mayo, Luis D’Elía se comunicó con Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil y le dijo: “Ahí hablé con Julio.... Lo tengo que ver mañana a las 10.00...”, en referencia al Ministro De Vido -que para D'Elía es sencillamente “Julio”-, para finalmente aclararle: “...y acá hay urgencia energética, ¿entendés lo que te digo?...” (Comunicación del 19/05/2013, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo 51.78404.20130519.225357, CD 80). Al día siguiente, tuvo lugar la reunión entre D’Elía y el Ministro De Vido. Se transcribe la comunicación: D’Elía: Estoy acá en la puerta de Planificación y entro a ver a Julio ehl Khalil: Bueno, bueno, llamame después. D’Elía: Le voy a tirar eso, eh ¿Dale? Khalil: Dale, si, si tranquilo. (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo 3815, CD 31) Transcurrida la reunión, D'Elía volvió a comunicarse con Khalil: D’Elía: Bueno, mirá, acá estuve hablando con el ‘quía Khalil: sí. D’Elía: Ellos están dispuestos a mandar la gente de YPF con nosotros dos...   Ministerio Público de la Nación Khalil: sí. D’Elía: A hacer negocios allá. Khalil: Bien. D’Elía: Está muy interesado en intercambiar lo de aquellos por granos y carne allá eh. Khalil: Bueno. D’Elía: Y... ¿cómo es? Tiene un problema político, necesitan que se apruebe el memorándum, ¿sí? Khalil: Y si, está el arito ese tema Luis...y o te lo dije el otro día, ¿Manifestaste lo que te dije? D’Elía: Si, yo les dije hace 10 días y me dijeron que en 30 días se aprobaba. Khalil: No, no, yo te dije que el memorándum se iba a aprobar ...yo te lo dije a vos, pero que lo estaban retrasando por esa cuestión* D’Elía: No...no, ahí hubo alguna....conté lo que vos me contaste, el incidente que hubo. Khalil: Si. D’Elía: Y... la reunión fue porque lo pidió la jefa ¡eh! Khalil: Bueno. D’Elía: Estamos al más alto nivel. Khalil: quiere decir que estamos bien. D’Elía: Si, si, re bien	ahora, si a nosotros no nos aprueban el memo ese, quedamos como unos pelotudos allá, ¿viste? Khalil: ¿Si no lo aprueban? Lo van a aprobar, eso lo van a aprobar... D’Elía: Bueno, pero a la brevedad lo tienen que aprobar, viste Khalil: Lo van a aprobar Luis, vos sabés cómo son los tiempos en Persiay aparte la lógicas que no se cumplen, o sea....eehh...De Vido tiene que saber que “Timerman no cumplió con algunas cosas "", esto es así de claro. no cumplió con algunas cosas.... (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-111124-8, CD31). Se refiere a que no se habían dado de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Cinco revelaciones primordiales surgen de estas conversaciones. 1) La familiaridad con De Vido, a quien llaman por su nombre de pila: “Julio”. 2) El interés por enviar a YPF a negociar con Irán, para intercambiar “granos por petróleo”, que llevó a las más altas autoridades nacionales a ordenar y ejecutar un encubrimiento. 3) La necesidad de que Irán apruebe el Memorando de Entendimiento como condición para iniciar los intercambios comerciales. Aquí radica una de las razones por las que se firmó semejante documento y la evidencia de que el acuerdo ha sido un medio para habilitar el comercio. 4) La reunión entre el Ministro De Vido y D’Elía, “/a pidió la jefa ”, la primera interesada en que el plan de encubrimiento avance pues se trata de la llave que destraba el comercio. 5) El acuerdo secreto del canciller Timerman para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, su fracaso en las acciones destinadas a lograrlo y la consecuente frustración iraní por la persistencia de las prioridades de búsqueda policial. Más tarde, ese mismo día, Jorge Khalil informó a Irán del avance de las negociaciones. Le avisó a Abdul Karim Paz, sheik de la mezquita “At Tauhid”, líder religioso de la comunidad musulmana chiita y mano derecha de Mohsen Rabbani, quien se encontraba en Irán, que: “...el tema que necesita Argentina es petróleo, todo petróleo, y todo lo que está comprando...Irán en grano se lo pueden dar, ese petróleo a cambio de granos... ” y agregó: “...Argentina tiene una gran necesidad de petróleo e Irán tiene una gran necesidad de granos y todo eso, empezar el intercambio...'"" (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-133130-8, CD 31). Seguidamente, continuó reportando a Irán: “ ...mirá que está todo para darse, decile, que se dejen de hinchar las pelotas...” y destacó: “...yo te estoy diciendo ahora es el tema de...que me lo pide Cancillería y De Vido respondió: si yo tengo que mandar a la gente responsable de YPF para hacer negocio ...necesitan crudo, petróleo...y empezar a intercambiar...” (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-133130- 8, CD 31). Al BPRTO MISM Ministerio Público de la Nación	fiscal	geneha. Y	lo resumió: “...Acá hay luz verde para hacer las operaciones y mandar a la gente, el tema es que quieren que se apure el memorándum ...En principio, deciles que el tema que necesita Argentina es petróleo, todo petróleo, y todo lo que está comprando...Irán en grano se lo pueden dar, ese petróleo a cambio de granos... ¿entendés? ...y se habló con De Vi do... que todo esto se habló con De Vido... Argentina tiene una gran necesidad de petróleo e Irán tiene una gran necesidad de granos y todo eso, empezar el intercambio. Eso por un lado. Por el otro lado, De Vido entiende que para dar un paso en esto...o sea oficial, de Estado a Estado, tiene que haber firma del memorándum, porque si no, siguen los privados, nada más...como están laburando...O sea, que se firme primero el memorándum para empezar a hacerlo de Estado a Estado, porque por ahora los únicos que están trabajando son los privados...” (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 133130-8, CD 31). También resaltó: “...hay otro mensaje más importante de hoy, fresco, de que están dispuestos a mandar ya a los jefes de YPF a Caracas a juntarse con los responsables que sea...de ahí...’’’' y le aclaró que viajarían tanto él -Khalil- como Luis D'Elía (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-05-20-132253-6, CD 31). Luego de estos reportes de Khalil, Abdul Karim Paz -quien se encontraba en Irán- efectuó consultas a las autoridades locales y transmitió la respuesta: “...acá están listos desde siempre, que el problema lo tienen más que nada allá... per o dicen que pongan fecha y que acá no hay problema, va una delegación para allá a Venezuela y arreglan todo, no hay problema...que ellos pongan la fecha cuando quieren ir...” (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 140034-12, CD 31). Seguidamente, Khalil retransmitió el mensaje de Teherán a un colaborador de Luis D'Elía: “...Hablé con Baharvand...transmitile esto a Luis...me dice Bahai’vand que están interesados, que pongan fecha y ya mandan a la delegación a donde crean ellos conveniente para empezar las tratativas, es decir, no hay ningún tipo de inconveniente...el que viaja creo que es Baha...va a ir él, no va a ir cualquier cuatro de copas...es el que ¡leva las negociaciones...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-143508-24, CD 31). Por si esto fuera poco, toda esta negociación culmina en manos del imputado Mohsen Rabbani. Así se lo informó Khalil: “...hoy terminamos una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos...”, a lo que Rabbani le contesta: “Mándeme para que yo evalúe... ”, dejando totalmente claro que Rabbani conserva capacidad de decisión dentro del régimen en todas las cuestiones relacionadas con la República Argentina (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31). Es inconcebible, altos funcionarios del gobierno argentino terminan negociando secretamente con un imputado de la causa AMIA, a quien, además, benefician con una desvinculación judicial ilegal mediante sofisticadas maniobras de encubrimiento. Unos días más tarde, Rabbani volvió a tomar parte en las negociaciones afirmando: “Yo les dije que nosotros...eh...habíamos conversado con Argentina, la verdad de...sufrimos mucho para que Irán, todas las compras ...Irán fue el primer comprador de Argentina y ahora no compra casi nada” y agregó: “pero puede cambiar...algo que es muy importante aquí, hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina, vender tractores ....y comprar armas...” (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Difícil de entender y mucho más de aceptar: altas autoridades argentinas entablaron una negociación secreta con un imputado de la causa AMIA, que además planifica “comprar armas”. Nótese en la secuencia. El 18 de julio de 1994 ocurrió un atentado terrorista en Buenos Aires. La justicia investigó y determinó responsabilidades de varios sujetos de nacionalidad iraní en la ideación y planificación de ese atentado. Esas personas han estado hasta la actualidad protegidas por el régimen al que pertenecen y que gobierna la República Islámica de Irán. El gobierno nacional negoció un acuerdo con ese país y, pasando por alto a la justicia y a la Constitución Nacional, brindó el marco jurídico necesario para que aquellos acusados puedan quedar desvinculados fraudulentamente de la causa por el atentado e impunes. Y en ese contexto, uno de los prófugos de la justicia argentina y beneficiario del pacto ilegal, Mohsen Rabbani, envalentonado por la posición del gobierno argentino, en lugar de responder las serias acusaciones que se alzan en su contra, negocia su impunidad, decide los pasos a seguir, controla el avance del plan criminal y, además, planifica “comprar armas”. Es decir, en el marco de este acercamiento entre las partes, que garantiza la impunidad de los acusados, uno de los principales prófugos decide y negocia comprarle armas a nuestro país. Esta cadena de conversaciones es importante debido a que revela, por un lado, que quienes motorizaron el plan de encubrimiento fue un grupo de funcionarios argentinos y sus cómplices. Demuestra también que Irán no necesitaba aprobar el Memorando de Entendimiento para negociar. Estaba dispuesto a comerciar de todos modos y así lo manifestó uno de sus más importantes representantes oficiales, el Ex Encargado de negocios en Argentina, Mohsen Baharvand expresando que estaban “listos desde siempre ”. Esto último es central. Desde el primer momento la cúpula del régimen iraní supo que para las autoridades argentinas imputadas en esta maniobra, era vital encaminar primero el Memorando de Entendimiento antes de avanzar con el intercambio comercial. Ese mensaje había llegado perfectamente a Teherán. Por su parte, las autoridades iraníes habían expresado su histórico interés por comerciar. Les resultaba indiferente la aprobación o no del Memorando de Entendimiento. No existen indicios que sustenten que la cuestión en torno a la causa AMIA fuera impedimento alguno para que Teherán retomara los lazos comerciales con Buenos Aires. Sólo firmaron el Memorando de Entendimiento, por haber acordado que ello sería suficiente para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas. No preocupaban las acusaciones de la justicia argentina, sino únicamente que sus funcionarios puedan circular irrestrictamente por el mundo. De hecho, señales históricas previas a estas acciones delictivas, dan cuenta de la siempre vigente intención de Teherán por comerciar con Buenos Aires. Ejemplo de ello, en el año 2007, tras una reunión con el entonces canciller iraní, Manuchehr Nottaki, D'Elía -ya entonces activo partícipe de este entramado de contactos- anunció que Irán quería reabrir la relación comercial con Argentina (Obarrio, Mariano, “D'Elía prometió acercarse más a Irán”, La Nación, 28/02/2007; “Causa AMIA: Para D'Elía, los acusados iraníes van a ser sobreseídos”, Infobae, 1/3/2013). Además, una vez oficializadas las negociaciones entre ambos países en relación a la causa AMIA, el entonces Presidente iraní declaró públicamente: “Estoy seguro de que cuando las investigaciones tengan lugar de manera precisa e imparcial, a continuación se avanzará en la ampliación de las relaciones entre Irán y Argentina” (“Ahmadinejad: Iran- Argentina transparent talks over AMIA leads to expansión of ties”, Fars News, 2/10/2012). Días antes, en rueda de prensa, había aseverado que esperaba “sostener conversaciones tendientes a alcanzar la verdad’ en relación al caso. Dijo: “Afortunadamente los argentinos han aceptado la propuesta. Tengo esperanza de que el diálogo entre los dos cancilleres pueda sentar las bases y una agenda para lograr este objetivo ”, agregando: “Queremos expandir nuestras relaciones....” (“Ahmadinejad dice que quiere 'expandir las relaciones' con la Argentina”, Clarín, 26/09/2012). Estas expresiones por parte del presidente iraní en ejercicio en aquel momento, en el marco de las tratativas que estaban llevándose a cabo, remiten nuevamente a la retórica de deslegitimación sobre la actuación judicial argentina, sobre la necesidad de otra dirección en la pesquisa y - fundamentalmente- sobre el siempre vigente interés por comerciar.   Estos son ejemplos que demuestran que la República Islámica de Irán estaba dispuesta a negociar sin necesidad de ratificar el Memorando de Entendimiento porque, a diferencia del gobierno argentino, nada tenía que explicar a su ciudadanía. De allí que su interés en la firma de ese documento, como se verá, no estuvo centrado en el comercio entre Estados sino el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que pesan sobre sus funcionarios. Una vez más, corresponde aclarar que el comercio con Irán o con cualquier estado es, en sí mismo, perfectamente legítimo. Delictivo es acordar la impunidad de un crimen de lesa humanidad, cualquiera fuera el motivo. En suma, las pruebas demuestran la existencia de un manifiesto interés de la cúpula del gobierno argentino por restablecer las relaciones comerciales con Irán -dada la severa crisis energética nacional-, como así también la urgente necesidad de borrar de un plumazo las acusaciones del caso AMIA para poder llevar adelante ese propósito. Aquí radica, según la evidencia reunida, uno de los motivos -quizás el principal- de la Presidente para impulsar el plan de encubrimiento, cuya investigación se propicia con la presente denuncia, para el juzgamiento y castigo de todos los que han tomado parte. Aclárese una vez más que aquí no se pone en tela de juicio la decisión de establecer relaciones comerciales con otras potencias extranjeras. Se conoce que dichas decisiones no son judiciables. Además son, en su esencia, legítimas. Lo que sí se cuestiona y se denuncia son las circunstancias que han tornado delictivo este cuadro de situación, esto es, la decisión de encubrir a un conjunto de prófugos de la justicia argentina en un caso de terrorismo internacional como medio ilegal para resolver un conflicto bilateral nacido de una investigación judicial, y así habilitar, entre otras cosas, el comercio entre los países. Sucede que las autoridades argentinas no han condicionado por capricho el restablecimiento de las tan anheladas relaciones comerciales con Irán, a ciertos pasos en la ejecución del plan encubridor. Cristina Fernández estaba convencida que sin la aprobación del Memorando de Entendimiento y, por ende, del encubrimiento, le hubiese resultado muy costoso avanzar en el terreno comercial. Por ello, como ya se aseveró y se probó, se tomó el camino de la mentira, el engaño, la manipulación y el delito. Se pergeñó un plan de encubrimiento y, en su parte pública, se lo disfrazó de negociaciones diplomáticas y de tratado bilateral. Todo esto motiva la presente denuncia. b.	3) Pruebas del interés geopolítico por alinearse con Irán En paralelo al interés de la Dra. Fernández y su Canciller por restablecer intercambios comerciales al nivel estatal con Irán, como paliativo para la severa crisis energética, también se obtuvieron elementos probatorios que dan cuenta de una motivación de índole geopolítica, que - según esas pruebas- contribuyó a impulsar la decisión y la ejecución del plan de impunidad aquí denunciado. En este sentido, resultan sustancialmente reveladoras las palabras de “Alian”, quien ha jugado un papel clave en el plan criminal, dada su vinculación a la Secretaría de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación y cercanía al entorno presidencial, y su activa relación con el operador local de Teherán, Jorge Khalil. Este individuo, que funcionó como nexo entre distintos partícipes del plan y que contribuyó activamente en la elaboración de la pista falsa para redireccionar la investigación, afirmó: “...ya estamos en otro país, es otra situación mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Con esas palabras, aludía a que existía un nuevo escenario geopolítico en el que ya no convenía sostener la enemistad con Irán, por lo que estos operadores, y así lo dijo “Alian”, se vieron en la necesidad de “trabajar en otro contexto”, para lo cual se planeó que viniera “...otra hipótesis con otras pruebas...”, que descolocara al suscripto, que lo dejara ALBEBTONIS^AN FISCAL GENER “...culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas...lo que viene ahora...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). En una misma conversación telefónica, “Alian” explicó esta íntima ligazón entre la nueva situación mundial y la necesidad de redireccionar la acusación para desvincular definitiva y fraudulentamente a Irán. Ya en noviembre de 2012, previo a la firma del pacto, los partícipes hablaban de la necesidad de “...construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA...”, y del rol de los servicios de inteligencia en esa tarea (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-l 009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Y las palabras de “Alian” explican que ello también se originó en un reposicionamiento geopolítico de la Argentina. Nuevamente, cabe señalar que las decisiones políticas que hacen a la dirección de las relaciones exteriores de la Nación no están siendo analizadas ni cuestionadas en estas líneas. Solamente se las menciona porque, según las pruebas, revelan que el plan de impunidad también estuvo motorizado por razones de índole geopolítica. Pero como ya se dijo en relación al interés comercial, es la decisión de dotar de impunidad a los prófugos iraníes, y no tal o cual alineamiento internacional, lo que posee importancia jurídico-penal. Por lo demás, cabe señalar que más allá de los intereses comerciales y geopolíticos constatados en el material probatorio obtenido hasta el momento, no se puede descartar que hayan existido otros motivos alternativos y complementarios que hayan contribuido también a impulsar la decisión y las maniobras de encubrimiento aquí expuestas, los cuales podrán ser determinados en el curso de la pesquisa que aquí se propicia. b)	Memorando de Entendimiento Explicada la decisión y los motivos de los encubridores para colocar intereses espurios y delictivos por encima de la justicia y la ley, se explicará en este punto otro aspecto del plan de encubrimiento. El Memorando de Entendimiento ha sido concebido como el instrumento que contribuye más eficazmente a la consecución del plan destinado a desvincular del caso y dotar de impunidad a un conjunto de imputados por el atentado contra la AMIA. Se advierte que este plan criminal se distingue por su sofisticación. No se trata de alguien que ayuda a un prófugo ocultándolo circunstancialmente en su casa, para eludir a las agencias de seguridad en la persecución. Aquí se tomó la decisión y se acordó la impunidad de los imputados y, luego, se buscó diagramar un modo de llevarlo adelante con visos de aparente legalidad, para hacerlo pasar por un acto legítimo ante los ojos de la sociedad argentina, primero, y del mundo después, insistiendo que el diálogo era el mejor mecanismo para solucionar los conflictos. El acuerdo debía poder ser presentado como un instrumento pensado para procurar justicia, cuando -en realidad- estaba y está claramente destinado a lo contrario: a obstruirla y a impedirla. De allí la elaborada sofisticación del delito denunciado. La suscripción del Memorando de Entendimiento entre Argentina e Irán fue anunciado el 27 de enero de 2013 en Adís Abeba, Reino de Etiopía. Tanto la Sra. Presidente como el Canciller Timerman lo presentaron como un “logro histórico'1'’ y, como reiterarían hasta el hartazgo, afirmaron que se trataba de una herramienta que facilitaría la cooperación internacional, especialmente pensada para colaborar con la justicia argentina en la causa AMIA. Ese mismo día, Jorge Khalil, agente del régimen iraní en Buenos Aires y contacto personal del prófugo Mohsen Rabbani, celebraba: “...este acuerdo...esta nueva relación...esta nueva etapa...” (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-27-112032-4, CD 266). Pero si el acuerdo, en teoría, había sido creado para contribuir con los requerimientos de la justicia argentina, si -como se dijo luego- se había logrado que Teherán se allane y si -como también se dijo- esto Ministerio Público de la Nación	A!	berto	nism rlSCAL GENERA,. serviría para sentar a los prófugos ante el Juez de la causa: ¿qué es lo que festejaba Jorge Khalil, uno de los hombres de máxima confianza de Mohsen Rabbani en Buenos Aires? ¿La indagatoria de su jefe? ¿Qué finalmente la justicia tenía un modo de obligarlo a comparecer, cuando éste evitó hacerlo por casi una década, amparándose en inmunidades diplomáticas y en el territorio de Irán? Si el pacto tenía por único norte lograr las indagatorias de los imputados, como se afirmó, ¿por qué se negociaron en secreto intercambios comerciales por petróleo? ¿Y, en todo caso, por qué se negó que hubiera tratativas al respecto? ¿Por qué el Ministro De Vido se reunió y habló con Luis D'Elía de este intercambio, a pedido de la Presidente Cristina Fernández, si lo único que importaba era asistir a la justicia? De hecho, mientras se afirmaba que se pretendía contribuir al avance con la causa judicial, por detrás, en el mayor de los secretos, sin que los sobrevivientes y los familiares de las víctimas supieran, sin que nadie supiera nada, ¡negociaban con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani por petróleo y armas! Al día siguiente de la firma del pacto, el sujeto identificado como “Alian”, partícipe de este encubrimiento, que responde a un sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia y tiene acceso al entorno presidencial, llamó - justamente- a Jorge Khalil y exultante dijo: “Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me tenías feen clara alusión a la suscripción del acuerdo (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). Nuevamente cabe preguntarse: ¿Por qué la firma de un acuerdo que teóricamente pondría a su jefe, Mohsen Rabbani, frente a la justicia que venía eludiendo iba a tranquilizar y/o alegrar a Khalil? ¿Qué parte de semejante escenario podía ser considerado un triunfo por Khalil? ¿Por qué un agente de inteligencia argentino, como “Alian”, comparte los intereses con un agente orgánico del régimen iraní en la Argentina? Las circunstancias que se analizarán en todo este acápite revelan, justamente, que Khalil tenía claros motivos para alegrarse, festejar y tranquilizarse ante la firma del “Memorando de Entendimiento”, porque significaba que se materializaba el plan de encubrimiento de Rabbani y de todos los otros acusados iraníes. Y Khalil lo sabía, conocía perfectamente que el documento que se había firmado era un simple camuflaje jurídico que escondía bajo una apariencia legal un pacto mucho más amplio, acordado de antemano, que beneficiaba a sus jefes, puesto que tenía la capacidad para desvincularlos definitivamente de las imputaciones que se les habían hecho por su responsabilidad en el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA. Esta reflexión viene al caso pues en este punto se planteará justamente el rol que este acuerdo tiene en un plan delictivo mucho más amplio y del cual no es la única ni la última pieza, aunque -sin lugar a dudas- la más visible de todas. En efecto, la vaguedad, ambigüedad e imprecisión de su texto ha permitido dotar de flexibilidad al plan, previendo distintos caminos hacia el encubrimiento y la impunidad de los imputados iraníes. Estas disposiciones incluidas en un mismo texto son lo suficientemente versátiles para poder alternarse entre unas y otras o bien combinarse de acuerdo a las necesidades políticas de quienes se encuentran involucrados en este plan. Así, a priori, existen disposiciones en el texto que permiten encubrir a los acusados de distintas maneras: a) propiciando el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol (punto 7); b) garantizando impunidad mediante la instauración acordada de un procedimiento intrincado, infinito, que no conduce a nada y que solo diluye acusaciones y viabiliza desincriminación, alternativa notablemente favorecida por la ausencia total de plazos que marquen la implementación del acuerdo; y c) articulando, a través de la “Comisión de la Verdad” creada en el pacto, la desvinculación total de los imputados respecto del atentado contra la AMIA, permitiendo redireccionar la pesquisa hacia otros autores e hipótesis. En fin, el documento contiene numerosos recursos y opciones para avanzar con el plan criminal, conforme lo exijan sus autores y Ministerio Público de la Nación	r FISCAL GENEriA ejecutores, en virtud de la enorme cantidad de variables que operan en una maniobra de tamaña sofisticación. c.	1) Cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Interés de Irán De los ocho	imputados de origen iraní	con pedido de captura nacional	e	internacional	por el caso AMIA, hay cinco que -como ya se explicó en la parte introductoria- tienen la máxima prioridad de búsqueda por parte de Interpol (notificaciones rojas) y, cabe tener presente, estos sujetos ostentan un significativo peso en la escena política iraní. Las pruebas	obtenidas indican que han	existido negociaciones y acuerdos	previos entre	las partes sobre el cese de	las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. En efecto, los elementos reunidos hasta el momento permiten concluir que la baja de las notificaciones rojas constituyó el interés central para las autoridades iraníes en este acuerdo y el Canciller Timerman aceptó y contribuyó a ello. Hizo todo lo posible para que ese objetivo fuera cumplido por Interpol. Más allá, claro está, de sus declaraciones públicas en sentido contrario, porque sostener la verdad, además de confesar su participación en el plan delictivo, hubiese sido incompatible con los reclamos de justicia en este expediente. La diligente y a la vez inesperada - para los encubridores- actitud de Interpol, específicamente de su Secretario General, Ronald Noble, se lo impidió. La primera prueba que abona dicha afirmación es la existencia del documento que describió el Sr. José Ricardo “Pepe” Eliaschev en su declaración testimonial. En el mismo, el Ministro Salehi proponía al Presidente Ahmadinejad, que lo autoricen a solicitar la revocación de los pedidos de captura internacional con respaldo de Interpol, expresando un especial interés en mejorar la situación procesal del entonces Ministro de Defensa Ahmad Vahidi, uno de los imputados con notificación roja vigente (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). No está de más recordar que entre los días 31 de mayo y 1 de junio de 2011, Bolivia había recibido al entonces Ministro de Defensa de Irán, Ahmad Vahidi, uno de los prófugos de la causa AMIA, haciendo caso omiso de la orden de captura internacional dictada por la justicia argentina y las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Solo el repudio generalizado que desató este recibimiento forzó al gobierno boliviano a expulsar al funcionario iraní (“Bolivia echó a Ministro de Defensa iraní acusado por atentado en la Argentina”, Infobae.com, 31/5/2011; “Evo expulsó a un funcionario iraní”, Página 12, 1/6/2011; “Bolivia pide disculpas a la Argentina y expulsa a Ministro de Defensa iraní”, El mundo, 1/6/2011). Bajo juramento el testigo Eliaschev aseveró que el documento que tuvo oportunidad de ver consistía en “un informe de la cancillería iraní al presidente Ahmadinejad, un típico ‘paper’ intergubernamental, donde el responsable de las relaciones exteriores del régimen de ese país le sugiere al presidente que en virtud de los elementos de juicio que maneja la cancillería iraní corresponde avanzar en un acuerdo importante con Argentina porque...están dadas las condiciones para que los argentinos decidan dar vuelta de página... ” (fs. 131.189/131.194). Como ya se mencionó al hablar de los ofrecimientos rechazados por Néstor Kirchner, existió un antecedente al pacto con Irán, del año 2006, que fue redactado por Fernando Esteche quien, junto con Jorge Khalil, lo hicieron llegar a las autoridades de ambos gobiernos. De ello dan cuenta una serie de comunicaciones telefónicas que han quedado judicialmente registradas: “...lo único que sé que es el mismo documento que hicimos nosotros hace seis años y lo presentamos, tanto en la Embajada de Irán como a gente del gobierno... ”, “...el mismo, boludo, el mismo pusieron...como lo dijimos nosotros ...todo como lo escribimos con Fernando hace seis años... ”, “...el acuerdo que hicimos hace seis años nosotros con Fernando Esteche y nos trataron de locos a nosotros ...cuando lo planteamos, lo mismo, está escrito, hace seis, siete años, en el 2006...nos dijeron 'están locos, esto no tiene asidero’...hoy lo sacaron... ”, “...decían que esto era imposible, que no se podía hacer... ”, ""... ¿Sabes quien me lo escribió a mí, ese día, el memorando ese, quién lo escribió?...Fernando... ”, en alusión a Esteche (Comunicaciones del 27/01/13, abonado N°11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01 -27-174637-12, CD 266; Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-27-112032-4, CD 266; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-112552-12, CD 266; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266). En esa oportunidad, Khalil había aclarado: “...ese plan lo hicimos con Fernando Esteche hace seis años ...cuando se lo llevé a Baharvand, me dijo no...” (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado N°ll- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266). Es decir, que si bien Kirchner no lo había aceptado, tampoco había tenido acogida en Irán. Hoy se puede concluir que el rechazo iraní se pudo deber a que, en aquella época, INTERPOL no había emitido aún las notificaciones rojas contra los funcionarios persas y, en consecuencia, no existía el motivo que activó posteriormente el interés de Teherán en avanzar con un acuerdo por el tema,	conforme ha sido probado en esta	presentación.	Sin notificaciones rojas que desactivar, no había interés de Irán para firmar ningún acuerdo con Argentina. Esto implica que desde el inicio mismo de estas negociaciones, la parte iraní estaba especialmente interesada en	dar de	baja	las notificaciones	rojas de Interpol y tenía como norte	favorecer	con	esa medida a los	cinco afectados, pero en particular, al	entonces	Ministro Vahidi. De hecho, las pruebas no revelan otros intereses tan concretos por parte de Teherán. La disposición séptima del Memorando de Entendimiento fue el punto de partida para habilitar la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, es decir, el primer paso para garantizar la impunidad de los imputados. b.	l.a) El punto séptimo, la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas y el consecuente desinterés de Irán La maniobra para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol se tradujo con sutileza en el texto del acuerdo, precisamente en el punto 7o que establece: “Este acuerdo, luego de ser firmado, será remitido conjuntamente por ambos cancilleres al Secretario General de Interpol en cumplimiento a requisitos exigidos por Interpol con relación a este caso”. La falta de precisiones en el texto sobre la implicancia de la comunicación prevista en esta disposición, cuya operatividad a sola firma -la única de todo el acuerdo- y sin necesidad de ratificación interna la distingue del resto del acuerdo, permitió esgrimir argumentos dirigidos a relativizar la razonable sospecha inmediata que despertó este punto. Al conocerse el memorando, tanto la dirigencia comunitaria judía local como grupos de familiares y víctimas del atentado, entre otros, expresaron su profunda preocupación sobre la verdadera implicancia de esta comunicación y su potencial letalidad respecto de las búsquedas prioritarias ordenadas por Interpol. En este sentido, se alegó que mediante esta comunicación se estaban cumpliendo compromisos asumidos ante Interpol que son inexistentes. Nada se había acordado ni existía compromiso alguno. De hecho, agrupaciones de víctimas, familiares y entidades comunitarias intentaron que la cancillería argentina propicie un anexo al memorando de entendimiento donde se especifique -entre otras cosas- que su suscripción en nada afectaría a la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas. Como se verá más adelante, si bien primero trascendió que ello había sido acordado con Timerman, luego el Canciller negó haberse comprometido con familiares y dirigentes comunitarios a tramitar un anexo al acuerdo. Estaba claro que numerosos sectores sociales argentinos, guiados por conclusiones hermenéuticas surgidas del análisis de este punto 7 advirtieron que su aplicación podría derivar en el cese de las notificaciones rojas. Lo novedoso es que se han hallado pruebas que confirman esa sospecha. Ahora se encuentra probado que justamente el cese   Ministerio Público de la Nación de esas notificaciones fue uno de los puntos pactados secretamente por el Canciller Timerman por tratarse del interés principal de la contraparte iraní para firmar el acuerdo. La prueba reveladora de que las expectativas iniciales de los firmantes del acuerdo eran que Interpol levante las capturas son las manifestaciones de quienes participaron activamente de las tratativas entre las autoridades argentinas e iraníes, por canales paralelos y en secreto, y que -naturalmente- sabían de la existencia del acuerdo secreto de Timerman para el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. En febrero de 2013, apenas un mes después del acuerdo, hablando con el referente local de Irán Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, “Alian” le confesó que en la Secretaría de Inteligencia se comentaba que Interpol iba a levantar las notificaciones rojas que pesaban sobre los imputados iraníes. En concreto, dijo: “Tengo un chisme...me dijeron ahí en la casa ...Interpol va a levantar el pedido de captura de los amigos...Lo va a levantar ahora ”. Khalil se alegró: “¡No me digas! ¡Menos mal!” (Comunicación del 25/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-25-151137-12, CD 295). El entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán, Alí Pakdaman, ya le había avisado a Khalil, el mismo día de la firma del acuerdo con Irán, que iba a tener mejores noticias aún. Así lo explicó Khalil: “...lo llamé a Pakdaman...yo ya estaba al tanto, me dice. Son buenas noticias, me dice, y vas a tener mejores noticias todavía, me dijo. Recién, recién, hace un ratito...” (Comunicación del 27/01/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-122441-28, CD 266). Esto contribuye a corroborar que el levantamiento de las notificaciones rojas formó parte de la negociación secreta. En otras palabras, esa era la información que circulaba y, tal como había sido acordado por argentinos e iraníes en la ejecución del plan de impunidad y plasmado en el punto 7 de la letra del memorando, el cese de las notificaciones rojas asomaba como una posibilidad cierta. Por su parte, la interpretación que Irán tenía del punto siete del acuerdo, resulta ser un elemento central para entender el verdadero significado del mismo. En ese sentido, un primer indicio surgió cuando la agencia oficial de noticias iraní (IRNA) publicó bajo el título “Memorando de Entendimiento firmado entre Irán y Argentina: Gran éxito diplomático”, el análisis jurídico que del texto del acuerdo realizó el experto iraní en derecho internacional, Mohammad Hossein Mahdavi. En ese documento, el jurista sostuvo: “El propósito del artículo [punto 7 del memorando], en realidad, era que las dos partes conjuntamente señalaban a INTERPOL que la diferencia entre las dos partes por el caso AMIA, y que motivó que algunas personas aparezcan en la lista de alerta roja de esta organización, se había resuelto a través de la cooperación mutua, y por lo tanto, la INTERPOL podía anular esta lista...” (Mahdavi, Mohammad Hossein, “Memorando de Entendimiento firmado entre Irán y Argentina: Gran éxito diplomático”, IRNA, 7/2/2013). Esta interpretación fue indiscutidamente refrendada por las declaraciones del propio Ministro Salehi -cofirmante del tratado- cuando, según informó la agencia de noticias IRNA, manifestó que: “según el acuerdo firmado por ambos países, la Interpol (Policía Internacional) debe eliminar las acusaciones contra las autoridades iraníes” y criticó a Interpol por haber aseverado que las mismas permanecían vigentes (IRNA, “Salehi: Irán y Argentina trabajan conjuntamente para resolver las acusaciones sobre la AMIA”, 18/03/2013; “Irán asegura que el acuerdo con Argentina incluye retirar las “notas rojas” de Interpol”, La Nación, 18 de marzo de 2013; “Tehran insists accord with Argentina includes Interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects”, Mercopress, 19/03/2013). Como bien lo aclaró el canciller iraní, se esperaba que aun sin entrar en vigencia, el acuerdo sirviera para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Si éstas cayeran, ya nada llevaría a los sospechados a ponerse verdaderamente a disposición de la justicia argentina. Porque aunque las notificaciones rojas no han tenido la capacidad para obligar a los acusados iraníes a comparecer ante el juez argentino, claramente se erigieron como el único elemento que dificultó la movilidad internacional de varios de los imputados, estorbando la total impunidad con la que se han conducido hasta ahora. Al respecto, cabe tener presente que en reiteradas ocasiones, esta Unidad Fiscal ha tomado conocimiento de viajes de los acusados al exterior, oportunidades en las que se arriesgaron a ser detenidos, en virtud de los pedidos de captura internacional y notificaciones rojas vigentes. Sin más, en mayo de este año, representantes de la República de Corea consultaron sobre las implicancias de una posible invitación al imputado Mohsen Rezai para que visite dicho país, por lo que el abajo firmante dispuso comunicar inmediatamente a Interpol que, en caso de concretarse la visita, se haga efectiva la orden de captura internacional, con notificación roja, que pesa sobre el nombrado (Oficio del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto del 9/05/2014, Nota n°5572/14; Oficio al Jefe del Departamento Interpol de la Policía Federal Argentina fechado en 12/5/2014). Las evidencias obtenidas demuestran que Salehi había acordado con Timerman que el cese de las notificaciones rojas se produciría con la sola firma del memorando de entendimiento. Por ello, el artículo 7mo - referido a la comunicación a Interpol- fue el único previsto con carácter operativo. El único que podía y debía tener aplicación inmediata. El resto de los puntos del acuerdo necesitan la ratificación de ambas partes, el intercambio de notas reversales y la vigencia del tratado para que puedan ser cumplidos. La comunicación de la firma del acuerdo a un organismo exclusivamente policial, sin injerencia ni interés alguno en los tratados o avenimientos entre sus estados miembros, como es Interpol, tuvo como único propósito el cese de las notificaciones rojas de los prófugos iraníes. Lo cierto fue que las intenciones criminales para viabilizar la impunidad de los cinco acusados con prioridad de búsqueda policial por la causa AMIA, chocaron con un obstáculo inesperado. Con fecha 15 de marzo de 2013, la Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal - Interpol- envió una misiva al Canciller Timerman, firmada por Joel Sollier, Consejero Jurídico del organismo, en la que, en referencia al memorando de entendimiento, afirmaba:	La	Oficina de Asuntos Jurídicos de la Secretaría General de INTERPOL manifiesta que dicho acuerdo no implica ningún tipo de cambio en el estatus de las notificaciones rojas publicadas en relación a los crímenes investigados en la causa AMIA...” (Nota N° LA/35678-47/3.1/EGI/tsa, Consejería Jurídica, Secretaría General, Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal, 15/03/2013). Seguidamente, en el mes de mayo de 2013, el canciller argentino se reunió con el Secretario General de Interpol, Sr. Ronald Noble en Lyon, Francia. El Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto emitió un comunicado donde afirmó: “...Durante ¡a reunión, el Secretario General Noble reafirmó los términos vertidos por el Consejero General de Interpol en la carta del 15 de marzo, en el sentido que el Memorándum con Irán no afecta en forma alguna el estatus de ¡as notificaciones rojas emitidas por Interpol a instancias de la Argentina...” (Comunicado de Prensa N° 122/13 del 30/05/2013). Por su parte, Interpol reiteró esta misma información por comunicado oficial (Interpol, “La visita del canciller argentino a Interpol se centró en la colaboración policial internacional”, 30/05/2013). Justamente, la demora y reticencia del gobierno de Irán en la ratificación del memorando respondió a que el Canciller Timerman se vio impedido de cumplir con el compromiso secreto asumido respecto de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que debían cesar y no cesaron. Esto explica un hecho palpable: el retraimiento de Irán. Desde el momento en que Interpol comunicó que no caerían las notificaciones, Irán suspendió el tratamiento interno de ratificación del acuerdo, retirándolo del parlamento donde estaba incluido en el orden de temas a ser tratados, difiriendo en forma indefinida su implementación (Pagni, Carlos, “El kirchnerismo en el peor de los mundos”, La Nación, 30/05/2013; “Timerman estimó que en el próximo mes y medio el parlamento iraní aprobará el acuerdo por la AMIA”, Télam, 18/4/13; “Ultimátum oficial a   Ministerio Público de la Nación Irán: Espero que en un mes aprueben el memorándum”, Infobae, 18/04/2013; “Reclaman a Irán el aval al acuerdo”, Clarín, 19/04/2013). Sin perjuicio de ello y hasta la actualidad, las autoridades argentinas involucradas en este tema han intentado subsanar este contratiempo y han buscado persuadir a Irán para que acelere sus procesos internos, a fin de contribuir al plan de encubrimiento en marcha. En ese contexto, en abril de 2013, Timerman declaró: “Yo espero que en el próximo mes, mes y medio ya esté aprobado ...cuanto más tarden ellos, más dudas se van a crear sobre sus intenciones. Nosotros cumplimos con nuestra parte y estamos esperando que Irán cumpla con la suya"" (“Timerman estimó que en el próximo mes y medio el parlamento iraní aprobará el acuerdo por la AMIA”, Télam, 18/4/13; “Cuánto más tarde Irán en aprobar el memorando, más dudas va a generar”, Ámbito Financiero, 18/4/13; “Ultimátum oficial a Irán: Espero que en un mes aprueben el memorándum”, Infobae, 18/04/2013; “Reclaman a Irán el aval al acuerdo”, Clarín, 19/04/2013). En esa oportunidad, el Canciller explicó que el parlamento iraní debía volver del receso legislativo y a partir de allí tenía como prioridad el tratamiento del presupuesto anual y “luego está el tratado con la Argentina” (“Timerman confía en que Irán firmará el pacto en un mes”, La Gaceta, 19/04/2013). Ese mes, mes y medio, ya cumplió más de un año. Con el correr de los meses y, sobre todo, luego de la comunicación de Interpol de que las notificaciones rojas seguirían vigentes, Teherán advirtió que al canciller argentino le había sido impedido, por razones ajenas a su voluntad, cumplir lo prometido. Y así lo hizo saber, transmitiendo su malestar. Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, al día siguiente de haber regresado de la República Islámica de Irán, y luego de haberse reunido “con las más altas esferas...con los responsables capos...con la cancillería...” (Comunicación del 11/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-11 - 173407-12, CD 0022), le transmitió claramente al interlocutor paralelo de los funcionarios argentinos, Luis D’Elía, la desilusión iraní frente al compromiso incumplido. Manifestó: Khalil: Juntémonos, porque tenemos algunas tareas para hacer. D’Elía: Ah bueno, bueno, dale, dale, dale...che, ¿por qué está demorado todo eso? Khalil: Yyyyy...hay un poquito de....esto entre nosotros, hay un poquito de desazón de allá, de allá, no sé porque, hay desazón. D’Elía: ¿¡Desazón!? Khalil: Desazón, sí, sí, sí. No gustó algunas palabras que se dijeron eh, me parece... D’Elía: Ajá Khalil: Me parece que el ruso este de mierda  se mandó alguna. D’Elía: ¿Ah sí? Khalil: Si, sí. D’Elía: ¿Qué dijo? Khalil: No..., estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares"" también parece, pero bueno lo hablamos personalmente. D’Elía: Bueno, dale, dale, dale. (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	05-1 l-083146-8.wav, CD 0022). Las palabras de Khalil dejan entrever que, además del Memorando de Entendimiento, se había firmado otro documento, privado y reservado en este caso, en el que estaba incluido el tema de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Esto adquiere mayor veracidad si se lo conjuga con declaraciones del canciller iraní Salehi quien en marzo de 2013 expresó: “...El [contenido] del acuerdo entre Irán y Argentina en relación con la cuestión de la AMIA será hecho público en el momento adecuado y la cuestión [de los imputados iraníes] está incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo...” (“Tehran insists accord with Argentina includes Interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects”, Mercopress, 19/03/2013). Habiendo sido formulada esta declaración en el mes de marzo de 2013, es decir, dos meses después de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, resulta evidente que Salehi estaba hablando de otro acuerdo, de un convenio que en marzo de 2013 todavía no había sido dado a conocer al público en general y que incluía el tema de las notificaciones rojas de los acusados iraníes que, según había dicho anteriormente, debieron haber caído. En otras palabras, al verse truncada la posibilidad de avanzar con el compromiso asumido por parte de Timerman, Salehi reconoció la existencia de un acuerdo secreto sobre el tema. No trepidó en poner en evidencia a Timerman al sentirse traicionado. Cuatro días después de la conversación en la que Khalil comunicó a D'Elía la “desazón” de Teherán porque Timerman se “mandó alguna”, le pidieron a Khalil que se contacte urgente con D'Elía que estaba “en Presidencia”. D'Elía puso la comunicación telefónica en altavoz y aclaró que había un funcionario escuchando: “...yo estoy con una persona amiga, que te está escuchando, que yo no voy a nombrar...”. En esa conversación, Khalil destacó: “...Si, eso es importante, que cuentes eso también. Esos dos mensajes que...que molestaron. Y que de alguna manera u otra están perjudicando la relación...” (Comunicaciones del 15/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-100907-10, CD 26; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-101055-4, CD 26). Luego, el 20 de mayo y a raíz de la reunión entre D'Elía y el Ministro Julio De Vido, Khalil volvió sobre el tema cuando le reiteró a D’Elía: “...De Vido tiene que saber que Timerman no cumplió con algunas cosas, esto es así de claro, no cumplió con algunas cosas...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	05-20-111124-8, CD 31). Y al día siguiente, en relación al mismo tema, D'Elía repitió “...quedó en hablar con la número uno y me llamaba...”, en obvia alusión a la Dra. Fernández (Comunicación del 21/05/2013 abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo 2542, CD 32). El mensaje de “desazón” por el incumplimiento respecto de las notificaciones rojas había llegado de Teherán a la Casa Rosada. Esta cuestión siguió vigente muchos meses después, cuando Khalil volvió a señalar que no existió “dejadez” por parte de Irán en relación a la ratificación interna del pacto (Comunicación del 24/02/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-24-171304-2, CD 311). Ahora bien, frente a la contundencia del compromiso trunco, la reacción de Irán fue engañosa, dado que dijeron haber aprobado el acuerdo por una vía alternativa, sin comunicación oficial alguna y sin generar efectos legales. Aunque astutamente los iraníes actuaron como si se hubiera ratificado. En efecto, con fecha 20 de mayo de 2013 el entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, Alí Pakdaman, informó en una entrevista radial que su país había ratificado el memorando de entendimiento. El acuerdo había sido aprobado por el entonces Presidente de Irán, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, el día anterior, sin tratamiento parlamentario alguno (“Teherán aprobó el memorándum por el atentado a la AMIA”, Página 12, 20/05/2013; Kollmann, Raúl, “Ahmadinejad eligió la vía expeditiva”, Página 12,21/05/2013). En ese contexto, Khalil le dijo a D'Elía: “...Te dije, boludo, que se iba a aprobar, que te quedes tranquilo...” y le reclamó: “...que haga gestos este gobierno, Luis, nosotros ya nos cansamos de hacer gestos, que este gobierno empiece a hacer gestos...” (Comunicación del 20/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-122551 -14, CD 31). Los gestos a los que se refería Khalil eran la baja de las notificaciones rojas, aspiración principal de Irán, prometida por Timerman y nunca concretada debido a la acción de Interpol. En respuesta a ello, el “vocero” del gobierno argentino, Luis D'Elía, respondió: “...pero hay un matiz acá, que va a generar quilombo...lo aprobó Ahmadinejad, no lo aprobó el congreso iraní...” (Comunicación del 20/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-20-130940-28, CD 31) En junio de ese mismo año trascendió que en los días siguientes se daría a conocer la notificación de Irán sobre la aprobación del acuerdo y se realizaría una presentación conjunta de ambos países, para comunicar los pasos a seguir (Dinatale, Martín, “Negó Irán la denuncia del fiscal Nisman y lo acusó de sionista”; La Nación, 4/06/2013). A pesar de la reticencia de Irán, las autoridades argentinas seguían esforzándose para que se ratifique el acuerdo, dado el interés de varios de sus más altos funcionarios en continuar con el plan criminal. En esa línea deben interpretarse las palabras de la Sra. Presidente en ocasión de su discurso en la apertura de la 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, el 24 de septiembre de 2013, cuando afirmó que ya había transcurrido un tiempo prudencial, que la Argentina ya había dado aprobación al acuerdo y que ahora era el tumo de Irán. En sus palabras: “...Ahora esperamos que nos digan si se ha aprobado el acuerdo, cuándo se va a aprobar en caso negativo y que, además, pudiésemos tener una fecha de conformación de la comisión, una fecha también para que el juez argentino pueda ir a Teherán...para que no se confunda...nuestra paciencia con ingenuidad o estupidez” (Discurso de Cristina Fernández, 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2013). Este vivo reclamo derivó en el encuentro de cancilleres que tuvo lugar el 28 de septiembre de 2013, en la sede de Nueva York de las Naciones Unidas, el cual -como se determinó luego y más adelante se verá- se trató de una inaceptable “puesta en escena” motorizada por la Sra. Presidente y su Canciller. Sin noticias de la mentada ratificación, con fecha 20 y 21 de noviembre de 2013, en reuniones mantenidas en Zúrich, el Ministro Timerman manifestó haber presentado a los representantes iraníes una nueva propuesta, en el marco del pacto encubridor, mediante la que buscó avanzar con las cuestión de las declaraciones de los imputados (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N° 279/13, Declaración de prensa leída por el Canciller Timerman en Casa Rosada, 24 de noviembre de 2013). Según informó el mismo Canciller, funcionarios argentinos se habían reunido, “...para negociar los tiempos que llevará el cumplimiento de cada punto del Memorándum de Entendimiento entre la República Islámica de Irán y la República Argentina para allanar el camino de la justicia en la resolución del atentado a la AMIA.. En ese encuentro, “...la República Argentina le entregó a la delegación iraní una propuesta que permitiría concluir el mandato del Memorándum en 12 meses luego de la conformación de la Comisión de Expertos e incluye las garantías e inmunidades que permitan al Juez argentino de la Causa AMIA realizar las indagatorias en la ciudad de Teherán. Los funcionarios iraníes se comprometieron a dar una rápida respuesta a la propuesta argentina...”, aunque nada dijeron al respecto (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°279/13, Declaración de prensa leída por el Canciller Timerman en Casa Rosada, 24 de noviembre de 2013). También se informó que: “...Timerman habría reiterado a Zarif que la interpretación de la vigencia de las órdenes de captura de los acusados no la hizo Argentina, sino la misma Interpol...” (Dinatale, Martín, “La negociación con irán, empantanada por la lista de Interpol”, La Nación, 08/12/2013). Como una suerte de disculpa que deja entrever algo aquí ya probado: la persistente vigencia de las notificaciones rojas es una contrariedad, dado que existía un compromiso a dejarlas caer. Paralelamente, también en noviembre de ese año, Timerman continuó intentando subsanar la subsistencia inesperada de las notificaciones rojas. Volvió a reunirse con Noble, a quien informó de la continuación de las tratativas de ambos países en tomo al memorándum (Interpol, Comunicado de Prensa: “La seguridad mundial, eje de la visita a INTERPOL del Ministro argentino de Asuntos Exteriores”, Lyon, Francia, 26/11/2013). La intención era clara: con su visita, Timerman estaba intentando convencer a Ronald Noble que la controversia con Irán por el caso AMIA ya estaba encausada, a través del Memorando de Entendimiento, para que cediera y dispusiera el cese de las notificaciones rojas. En enero de 2014, a días de cumplirse un año de la firma del acuerdo con Irán, el Palacio San Martín emitió un comunicado relativo al República Islámica de Irán y la República Argentina para allanar el camino de la justicia en la resolución del atentado a la AMIA.. En ese encuentro, “...la República Argentina le entregó a la delegación iraní una propuesta que permitiría concluir el mandato del Memorándum en 12 meses luego de la conformación de la Comisión de Expertos e incluye las garantías e inmunidades que permitan al Juez argentino de la Causa AMIA realizar las indagatorias en la ciudad de Teherán. Los funcionarios iraníes se comprometieron a dar una rápida respuesta a la propuesta argentina...”, aunque nada dijeron al respecto (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°279/13, Declaración de prensa leída por el Canciller Timerman en Casa Rosada, 24 de noviembre de 2013). También se informó que: “...Timerman habría reiterado a Zarif que la interpretación de la vigencia de las órdenes de captura de los acusados no la hizo Argentina, sino la misma Interpol...” (Dinatale, Martín, “La negociación con irán, empantanada por la lista de Interpol”, La Nación, 08/12/2013). Como una suerte de disculpa que deja entrever algo aquí ya probado: la persistente vigencia de las notificaciones rojas es una contrariedad, dado que existía un compromiso a dejarlas caer. Paralelamente, también en noviembre de ese año, Timerman continuó intentando subsanar la subsistencia inesperada de las notificaciones rojas. Volvió a reunirse con Noble, a quien informó de la continuación de las tratativas de ambos países en tomo al memorándum (Interpol, Comunicado de Prensa: “La seguridad mundial, eje de la visita a INTERPOL del Ministro argentino de Asuntos Exteriores”, Lyon, Francia, 26/11/2013). La intención era clara: con su visita, Timerman estaba intentando convencer a Ronald Noble que la controversia con Irán por el caso AMIA ya estaba encausada, a través del Memorando de Entendimiento, para que cediera y dispusiera el cese de las notificaciones rojas. En enero de 2014, a días de cumplirse un año de la firma del acuerdo con Irán, el Palacio San Martín emitió un comunicado relativo al ALBERTO N'IS FISCAL GtNEÓAt. acuerdo celebrado por terceros países en torno al desarrollo nuclear de Irán y aseveró: “La Causa AMIA ha cumplido 19 años sin que se haya podido esclarecer y condenar a los responsables; es por ello que con el mismo espíritu que se lleva adelante la negociación por el programa nuclear iraní, el Gobierno argentino espera resolver con la República Islámica de Irán los aspectos pendientes que le permitan a las autoridades judiciales nacionales avanzar en los pasos procesales indispensables para la alcanzar la verdad y hacer justicia en la Causa AMIA.’1'' (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°006/14, “La Argentina celebra nuevo acuerdo diplomático entre los P5+1 e Irán”, 13 de enero de 2014). Efectivamente, la aprobación por parte de Irán nunca se concretó. Nuevamente, la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas, cuando se había pactado lo contrario, primó a la hora de decidir. En concreto, hasta la fecha, no se ha producido el intercambio de las notas reversales y, en consecuencia, el tratado no ha entrado en vigencia (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°110/13, del 21/05/2013). Luce evidente que el compromiso de Timerman, por orden de la Sra. Presidente, fue gestionar el cese de las notificaciones rojas en Interpol, dado que se trataba del interés cardinal de Irán para firmar el acuerdo. El apego a la legalidad del organismo internacional de policía frustró este primer objetivo del cometido criminal de los autores de este terrible plan de impunidad. Al cabo de un tiempo, consciente de la imposibilidad de barrer con las notificaciones rojas, Timerman hizo saber a su contraparte que el fracaso de ese punto no había sido su responsabilidad y que pese a todos sus esfuerzos en ese sentido, las notificaciones rojas no cayeron. Ello no significó la desarticulación del plan de impunidad. Fuera de toda duda, el interés de Teherán giró en torno al cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. No obstante ello, cabe tener en claro tres cuestiones. Primero, este revés no implica que el interés de Irán en el acuerdo haya desaparecido por completo. Segundo, para la configuración del encubrimiento aquí denunciado resulta irrelevante el interés de Irán o su predisposición respecto de la maniobra desplegada por los autores argentinos y sus cómplices. Esto es así, porque la configuración de este tipo penal no exige el consentimiento, ni siquiera demanda el conocimiento por parte del sujeto encubierto. Tercero, este revés no conlleva la desarticulación de la operación de encubrimiento llevada adelante por altos funcionarios del gobierno argentino y demás partícipes, activada por el acuerdo y que será explicada en detalle en el acápite siguiente. En suma, la existencia de este compromiso secreto y su frustrado cumplimiento permite comprender el retraimiento de Irán en relación a este primer objetivo del plan aquí denunciado y la desconfianza que debió generar entre encubridores y encubiertos. c. l.b) Punto Quinto del Memorando de Entendimiento En torno al tema de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol resta analizar un último punto. Como ya se dijo, el memorando de entendimiento cuenta con variados mecanismos o recursos, incorporados a su letra, para llevar adelante los distintos pasos convenidos en el marco del plan de encubrimiento. Esto, como se adelantó, dota al plan de flexibilidad y adaptabilidad a distintos escenarios, dada la enorme cantidad de variables imposibles de controlar por autores y partícipes. Gracias a esta característica del texto, la cuestión del cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, de máximo interés para la parte iraní, aún puede ser implementada siguiendo la letra del memorando, aunque no de manera tan directa y simple como lo prevé el artículo séptimo. En ese sentido, aún cabe la posibilidad de conseguir dicho objetivo, pero -esta vez- a través del punto 5 del acuerdo, esto es, en el marco de las audiencias a ser llevadas a cabo en Teherán, en las cuales la “Comisión de la Verdad” creada por este tratado, entrevistará a los cinco imputados iraníes que tienen notificaciones rojas de Interpol, en presencia   Ministerio Público de la Nación de autoridades judiciales iraníes y argentinas y de los representantes de ambos estados. Nótese que de los ocho imputados iraníes cuya declaración indagatoria ha sido ordenada en la causa, en el punto 5 del acuerdo que regla las “Audiencias de Teherán” únicamente se incluyó a los imputados con notificación roja de Interpol, cuyo cese -conforme lo determinado por la prueba- era esencial para Irán y así se había acordado. No existe explicación plausible para entender por qué las autoridades argentinas aceptaron que sólo se prevean audiencias respecto de aquellos cuyas notificaciones rojas podían caer, dejando de lado a los restantes imputados iraníes con captura judicial vigente, ordenada por el Sr. Juez Federal, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral. Así, del modo	en	que ha sido redactado el	punto 5 del memorando surge que los imputados sin notificaciones rojas de Interpol (Rafsanjani, Velayati y Soleimanpour) no tienen incentivo alguno para presentarse ante la justicia. El acuerdo preserva la impunidad de facto de la que gozan actualmente y la actuación de la comisión podría garantizársela para siempre. Por otro lado, los imputados con notificación roja (Fallahijan, Vahidi, Rezai, Rabbani y Asghari) podrían presentarse ante un juez iraní, miembros de la Comisión	y	el juez argentino, sin por	ello estar sometiéndose al proceso penal nacional. Si hubiera habido	una voluntad de someter	a	todos los acusados iraníes a la acción	de	la justicia argentina, como	se	argumentó para justificar el pacto ante la opinión pública, se hubiera incluido a todos los acusados y se hubieran acordado verdaderas declaraciones indagatorias conforme la ley argentina para todos los imputados y no meras entrevistas, solo para aquellos con notificación roja de Interpol. Presente ello, corresponde resaltar la verdadera entidad de estas “audiencias” y su posible implicancia. En primer lugar, cabe tener presente que en el debate parlamentario de aprobación del acuerdo, el Canciller Timerman aseveró que la presentación de los imputados ante este conjunto heterogéneo de actores políticos y judiciales se equipara al acto de encontrarse a derecho ante autoridades judiciales en el marco de un proceso penal en trámite. En sus palabras: “El memorándum establece que las autoridades judiciales argentinas procederán a interrogar a aquellas personas respecto de las cuales Interpol ha emitido una notificación roja de captura. Esta previsión sigue estrictamente la normativa procesal penal nacional que regula la procedencia de la declaración indagatoria de los imputados...” (Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de Comisiones en el Senado de la Nación, 13 de febrero de 2013). Esto mismo ya había dicho a los medios días atrás, cuando declaró que: “Lo concreto es que los sospechosos iraníes se van a sentar en el banquillo y se someterán a la indagatoria en los términos de la ley argentina, ante un juez argentino y un fiscal argentino” (Kollmann, Raúl, “Los iraníes se someterán a la ley argentina”, Página 12, 30/01/2013). Cabe aclarar, aunque resulte redundante, que del acuerdo no surge en modo alguno que el interrogatorio esté a cargo de las autoridades judiciales argentinas como así tampoco incluye referencias expresas a la aplicación de la normativa procesal argentina en ese acto y, menos aún, habilita al juez a detener a los imputados a su disposición, si lo creyera necesario, conforme lo prevé el derecho argentino. Primero, la acusación debe estar respaldada por un juez iraní de acuerdo a lo reglado por la ley iraní, lo que colisiona con lo expresado públicamente por el régimen de Teherán, en tanto afirmó haberse asegurado de la inocencia de todos sus ciudadanos. Además, no son todos “los sospechosos iraníes” los que se sentarían en el banquillo, como señala el Canciller, sino que está previsto en el acuerdo, como ya se indicó, que se interrogue solamente a cinco de los ocho imputados iraníes. Sobra decir que se está haciendo referencia a una actividad netamente judicial que el acuerdo delega ilegalmente en la “Comisión de la Verdad”, cuyas conclusiones -como la prueba lo refiere- ya estaban acordadas de antemano. Al 8ERT0 NI FISCAL GENERAL Pero, volviendo al análisis, una vez que los mencionados imputados comparezcan ante el juez iraní, los miembros de la “Comisión de la Verdad” y el juez argentino, se podría argumentar que ya no existirían motivos legales -en principio- para que Argentina siga requiriendo a Interpol la máxima prioridad de búsqueda de estos imputados que, desde esta lógica, ya estarían presentados en el proceso seguido en su contra. Esto haría, sin más, caer las notificaciones rojas, aunque el juez nunca tuvo posibilidades concretas de interrogarlos ni detenerlos, si así lo considerase. Otro ardid para lograr la impunidad de los acusados. En efecto, como en el acuerdo no se ha garantizado de forma alguna que el juez pueda proceder a la detención de los imputados, si éste decidiera dictar su procesamiento y prisión preventiva después de la supuesta “indagatoria”, se activa la trampa: ya presentados ante la “Comisión de la Verdad”, caen las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, pero no hay forma de sujetar a proceso a los imputados, que ahora quedan más libres que antes, sin ninguna restricción a su movilidad, con una justicia atada de pies y manos. Ahora bien, cabe destacar que las audiencias de Teherán previstas en el propio memorando distan enormemente de lo que se considera una declaración indagatoria conforme la normativa procesal vigente (art. 294 y cctes. del C.P.P.) y solo pueden ser entendidas -de acuerdo con la letra del tratado- como una simple entrevista ante los comisionados, en presencia de autoridades judiciales y representantes de ambos países. Como ya se expuso, en el escenario que describe el tratado, la magistratura argentina tiene totalmente restringidas sus facultades legalmente previstas. El acuerdo no prevé que el juez argentino pueda hacer comparecer por la fuerza pública a los imputados, ni que lleve adelante el referido interrogatorio, al resguardar los derechos garantizados por la ley iraní, que -además- impide que se pueda forzar la comparecencia, fundamentalmente, ante un magistrado foráneo (punto 8). Asimismo, conforme el tratado, el juez no puede disponer su detención -de considerarlo adecuado- y/o su traslado a nuestro país. El documento tampoco garantiza la aplicación de la ley argentina en la materialización de este acto sino que, por el contrario, todo indica que la ley aplicable -por razones de territorialidad- sería la iraní. En consecuencia, es completamente falaz afirmar que los imputados se encontrarían a derecho con solo presentarse a la entrevista ante la comisión, conforme lo estipula el punto 5. Sin embargo, la amplitud y vaguedad del instrumento y las múltiples interpretaciones posibles, abrirían necesariamente un debate, con el sólido riesgo de que esta discusión se desarrolle con las notificaciones rojas ya extintas, es decir, con el encubrimiento más avanzado aún. Como puede advertirse, todo está estructurado para la impunidad, con varias alternativas posibles para lograr tal fin. c.2) Impunidad por imposibilidad de aplicación de las disposiciones del tratado Como se dijo previamente, entre los mecanismos previstos en el pacto para garantizar la impunidad de los prófugos iraníes, existe una vía que descansa en la imposibilidad de aplicar sus disposiciones, por trabas a partir de un procedimiento intrincado, que no conduce a nada y que solo diluye acusaciones y viabiliza la desincriminación, lo que está favorecido por una interminable sucesión de pasos a definir y la ausencia total de plazos que marquen su implementación. En concreto, el memorando no tiene previsto ningún plazo. No se pautaron tiempos para crear la comisión, ni para emitir sus reglas de procedimiento, ni para la remisión de las pruebas e informaciones, ni para la elaboración del informe, ni para la realización de las audiencias en Teherán. Para nada. Nada tiene plazo en este acuerdo. ¿Y por qué? Porque lo único que importa del mismo es que permita favorecer y encubrir a los imputados, garantizándoles impunidad. Por eso el acuerdo no garantiza ley ni proceso y solo garantiza impunidad. De hecho, en la propuesta de noviembre de 2013, el Canciller Timerman dijo estar buscando fijar el plazo de un año para “...concluir el mandato del memorándum...”. No obstante, en los hechos, estipuló que dicho plazo comenzaría a correr recién a partir de la creación de la comisión, lo que supeditaba un plazo cierto a una condición o circunstancia incierta y sin término temporal que la rija. Lo mismo que nada. Fue un nuevo intento por ocultar los mecanismos de impunidad del plan. Y, además, sobra decir que a la fecha, Irán no ha respondido a la supuesta propuesta (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N°279/13, “Declaración de prensa leída por el canciller Timerman en Casa Rosada el domingo 24 de noviembre a las 21 horas”, 24/11/2013). En suma, esta omisión en materia de plazos y lo intrincado del procedimiento previsto, también constituyen salvoconductos de impunidad, dado que permiten alegar que hubo un acuerdo de partes y así viabilizar políticamente el restablecimiento de relaciones plenas entre ambos estados, sin solucionar realmente el tema AMIA. c.3) La “Comisión de la Verdad” y la invención de una hipótesis alternativa para desvincular a los iraníes de la causa AMIA. El plan criminal desplegado tiene por fin encubrir a los imputados iraníes en la causa AMIA, contribuyendo a sustraerlos de la acción de la justicia argentina, desvincularlos de la imputación judicial que pesa sobre ellos y -de ese modo- garantizarles su impunidad y cerrar definitivamente toda investigación respecto de ellos. Esta maniobra delictiva estuvo motivada por el interés de ciertos funcionarios argentinos de acercarse geopolíticamente a Irán y restablecer las relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado. Para ello se acordó, a través de conductas evidentemente delictivas, remover el impedimento que ha obstruido la relación bilateral por años, esto es, la cuestión judicial pendiente por la causa AMIA. En este punto habrán de exponerse los elementos probatorios que demuestran que la “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en el memorando de entendimiento firmado con Irán, constituye una de las principales vías aptas para posibilitar la desincriminación de los imputados iraníes respecto del atentado contra la AMIA, sin perjuicio de su real responsabilidad en el hecho, permitiendo agotar la maniobra de encubrimiento aquí denunciada. Asimismo, se enumerarán las pruebas que demuestran que autores y cómplices, como parte integrante del plan, habían planificado y avanzado en la fabricación de una hipótesis acusatoria alternativa, falsa pero verosímil, con “nuevas” pruebas fraudulentas, para redireccionar ilegalmente la pesquisa hacia otros imputados y así desligar definitivamente a los nacionales iraníes de toda relación con el atentado, engañando de esta manera a familiares, a víctimas, a la justicia y a la sociedad toda. c.3.a) La “Comisión de la verdad ” y su verdadero rol en el plan. El esquema gestado en el acuerdo permite contar con herramientas para avanzar hacia este objetivo que, como se advierte, es mucho más amplio e importante que el simple cese de la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Así, el Memorando de Entendimiento y fundamentalmente los puntos que prevén la creación, conformación, facultades y obligaciones de la “Comisión de la Verdad” (1 a 5 y 8) están redactados de modo tal de posibilitar: 1) la deslegitimación de la investigación sustanciada ante la justicia nacional, 2) la desautorización de los funcionarios que intervinieron en ella, 3) la tergiversación de pruebas y conclusiones, 4) la desacreditación de la acusación contra los actuales imputados y 5) el redireccionamiento de la investigación hacia nuevos culpables, como siempre solicitó Irán y ahora, delictivamente fue concedido por ciertas autoridades argentinas, en un giro de ciento ochenta grados con lo sostenido por el gobierno de Néstor Carlos Kirchner y parte del de Cristina Fernández. Estas acciones, sin importar si son realizadas en forma individual o conjunta, tienen por objeto generar un salvoconducto destinado a encubrir en forma definitiva a los imputados, permitiendo que éstos eludan la acción de la justicia, con el objeto de garantizarles su impunidad y que no se los vuelva a investigar nunca más. Como ya se dijo, el pacto guarda en la amplitud de su redacción cierto grado de sutileza, para que los objetivos delictivos subyacentes no emerjan en forma grotesca a los ojos del mundo. Con ese norte, se decidió que las conclusiones de la comisión no fueran propiamente vinculantes, dado que ello hubiera sido demasiado visible. Pero en los hechos es como si lo fueran, ya que los gobiernos se comprometieron a atar “sus futuras acciones” a los descubrimientos y recomendaciones de la comisión creada, que como su nombre lo sugiere, desentrañará “la verdad”. Esto obliga al Estado Argentino y a sus distintos órganos, a atender al referido dictamen. La comisión podría, según lo habilita el acuerdo, desacreditar fraudulentamente la prueba obtenida en la causa judicial y/o incorporar informaciones o pruebas que resulten falsas o ilegítimas y, así, redireccionar la investigación o crear sospechas y suspicacias que permitan introducir “nuevas hipótesis” sobre la explosión de la AMIA, que tengan por protagonistas a “nuevos imputados” que, a la luz del dictamen de comisión, terminen siendo los “verdaderos autores” del atentado. En este rol legitimador-deslegitimador, la comisión tiene la capacidad de descartar lo actuado por la justicia, desarticulando las imputaciones, sin que exista mecanismo de revisión sobre su pronunciamiento que, una vez comunicado y aunque pudiera ser posteriormente rebatido en otros ámbitos, ya habría generado un efecto deslegitimador irreversible. Nótese que su mera creación ya constituye una flagrante descalificación a la justicia argentina que, a la luz del acuerdo, parece necesitar de avales foráneos para avanzar con sus requerimientos y procedimientos. En suma, el texto del acuerdo contiene un instrumento con la capacidad institucional de consumar el encubrimiento aquí denunciado: la “Comisión de la Verdad”. Analizada en su totalidad la letra, el espíritu y los alcances del Memorando de Entendimiento surgen los siguientes interrogantes: ¿Por qué no se previo que el juez argentino pudiera tomar declaraciones indagatorias conforme a derecho, tal como lo prevé la ley argentina? ¿Por qué si se dijo que se había logrado que los iraníes acepten la jurisdicción argentina y declaren ante nuestro juez, no se lo puso por escrito en el acuerdo? ¿Por qué no se resguardaron sus facultades judiciales para poder disponer la comparecencia por la fuerza pública de imputados renuentes y/o su posterior detención si fuera necesaria? ¿Por qué se acordó que las audiencias se llevaran a cabo en Teherán, donde impera la ley iraní y donde el fiscal de la causa tiene pedido de captura -justamente- por haber acusado a funcionarios iraníes? ¿Por qué se dice que el acuerdo es compatible con la ley argentina cuando su aplicación implica dejar de lado la normativa en vigencia, única garantía que resguarda al proceso penal de nulidades futuras? ¿Por qué no se pautó ningún plazo, pero se habilitó la comunicación a Interpol aún sin que el tratado estuviera ratificado y vigente? ¿Por qué si Irán sostiene que cuenta con pruebas sobre el caso, no se exigió en el acuerdo que las presente ante la justicia argentina? ¿Por qué se creó una comisión con la facultad de deslegitimar lo actuado por la justicia argentina y se la llamó “de la verdad”? ¿Por qué se aceptó que la justicia argentina sea examinada y juzgada por un órgano extrajudicial con facultades judiciales ilegales? ¿Por qué el Poder Ejecutivo avanzó sobre la investigación de una causa penal en trámite, y no dudó en conculcar el principio republicano de gobierno y la expresa prohibición del art. 109 de la Constitución Nacional? ¿Por qué se siguió mintiendo y diciendo que la negociación comenzó en septiembre de 2012, aun cuando las autoridades iraníes no tuvieron restricciones legales ni secretos de estado que les impidieran reconocer que las mismas se habían iniciado mucho tiempo antes? ¿Por qué se incumplió con la promesa de comunicar a las víctimas y   Ministerio Público de la Nación a los familiares sobre los avances de la negociación, previo a arribar a cualquier acuerdo? ¿Por qué se desoyó el contundente rechazo que el memorando generó en las instituciones damnificadas por el atentado y - fundamentalmente- en varios grupos de familiares y víctimas que hicieron oír su disconformidad? Y así se podría seguir con muchísimos interrogantes más. Todos estos porqués tienen una única respuesta, sencilla e institucionalmente terrible: detrás de este pacto se oculta un plan criminal dirigido a procurar la impunidad para todos los imputados iraníes, creando instancias que puedan deslegitimar completamente las acusaciones de la justicia argentina respecto de todos ellos. Con su sola letra, el memorando tiene la potencialidad de deslegitimar las conclusiones a las que la justicia argentina arribó siguiendo las pruebas obtenidas y conforme a derecho. En su texto se acordó llamar “verdad” aquello que emane de un órgano creado por poderes políticos e ilegalmente ungido de facultades judiciales. Ello, ya de por sí sumamente grave, adquiere ribetes escandalosos cuando se conocen los pormenores de la negociación, que los partícipes expusieron sin tapujos en sus conversaciones, que en el punto siguiente se detallarán. c.3.b) Nueva hipótesis. nuevos imputados y nueva prueba: el camino a la impunidad. El plan criminal ordenado por Cristina Fernández, e instrumentado principalmente por Héctor Timerman, para liberar a los imputados iraníes de la acusación emitida y avalada por la justicia argentina, tenía previsto no solo la desvinculación de la causa de los actuales prófugos, sino también que otros responsables inventados ocuparan su lugar, para cerrar el círculo de la impunidad a cualquier costo. Así, la creación de una nueva hipótesis delictiva que explique desde otra perspectiva el atentado y que, redireccione la investigación hacia “nuevos responsables”, resultó ser una pieza fundamental y de enorme utilidad en el encubrimiento. Nótese que el redireccionamiento de la pesquisa hacia nuevos responsables ha sido desde siempre la salida que ha sugerido y solicitado la República Islámica de Irán. Que se desista de acusar a sus ciudadanos y se dirija la investigación para encontrar, en sus términos, a los “verdaderos autores”. Ahora, los funcionarios y cómplices argentinos involucrados en la maniobra de encubrimiento se mostraron dispuestos a aceptar ese abordaje pero, entre ellos, reconocían la verdad: que no se trataba de encontrar a los “verdaderos” autores, sino de inventar una nueva hipótesis, conseguir pruebas que la tornen creíble, y acusar a terceros inocentes, aun cuando la responsabilidad, como señalan las pruebas judiciales, sea de quienes se encuentran actualmente imputados. Así como se ha leído. Los acusados aceptaron y realizaron su aporte para lograr este escandaloso fin, buscando vaciar de contenidos las imputaciones judiciales del mayor atentado terrorista perpetrado en nuestro país, imputando a personas que de antemano se sabía inocentes. Presente ello, en el mes de noviembre de 2012, es decir, antes que se firmara el memorando, los involucrados en el encubrimiento ya estaban trabajando en la fabricación de los “nuevos imputados” por el atentado, por supuesto, ajenos a Irán. En ese tren de acciones, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil ya se había reunido con el Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia, ex fiscal que intervino en la causa y ex juez de Instrucción, actualmente vinculado a un sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia y partícipe de la maniobra que se denuncia. Así lo relató: “...tengo un par de cosas que contarte...tuve una charla con el fiscal...El fiscal de la causa...el que estaba, no el que está ahora... El que sabe es éste que te digo... el fiscal de la causa....”. Para luego señalar que el contacto con Yrimia le habría llegado a través de Fernando Esteche: “...Y, el que me sienta es Fernando” (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012- 11-04-130024-6, CD 182). Sobre el armado de esta nueva hipótesis, falsa pero necesaria para desplazar la acusación de los imputados iraníes, Fernando Esteche concluyó: “...quieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA, por ejemplo, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla, van a querer ir construyendo el consenso de esto...'''’ y, de la conversación se desprende, que esa tarea ha quedado a cargo de la Secretaría de Inteligencia, o al menos a un sector de ella. Al construir este “nuevo enemigo”, como “no van a poder decir que fueron los israelíes”, porque -claramente- no sería creíble, entonces tenían que armar una hipótesis falsa, y hasta hablaron de involucrar a “una conexión de fachos locales” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). En un tiempo en que ni la justicia ni los familiares y víctimas del atentado sabían qué estaba ocurriendo con las negociaciones entre Argentina e Irán, estos “operadores” conocían perfectamente que se venía un cambio de hipótesis y el redireccionamiento de la investigación hacia “nuevos imputados”, que reemplazarían a los imputados iraníes, fundado en pruebas falsas. Esto era así, pues ellos eran justamente algunos de los encargados de armar la nueva hipótesis falsa para desviar a la investigación de su curso verdadero. El objetivo de generar esta hipótesis fraguada y redireccionar la pesquisa ha sido: “...la esencia del nudo, el núcleo del nudo...es la inocencia de Irán...”, y también se dijo: “...es la inocencia de Irán con la inocencia de la comunidad como conexión local...” (Comunicación del 14/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341- 10, CD 284). Por eso, planificaban: “...construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA...”, y reconocían que los encubridores “...Van a plantear un blanqueo con ustedes...”, en alusión a los iraníes (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). En igual sentido, se decía: “...creo que vamos a la limpieza nuestra...” (Conversación del 1/6/2013, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo 224753, CD 0086). Sabían también que la “Comisión de la Verdad” no había sido creada para investigar absolutamente nada, sino para legitimar la mentira que se estaba fabricando. De hecho, en conversaciones del mismo día en que se firmó el pacto con Irán, se concluyó que unas de las dos partes - Argentina o Irán- tenía que salir perjudicada por la actuación de la “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en el acuerdo. Textualmente: “...alguien va a salir con la...con la cara manchada de acá...”, a lo que Khalil, la voz de Irán en este tema, reconoció: “...Obvio, eso ya está arreglado...”, pero aclaró que no iban a ser de los iraníes y remató: “... ¡¿cómo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo?! Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa...”. (Comunicación del 27/1/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266). De una importancia relevadora resulta el hecho de que un referente de la talla de Khalil supiera, contemporáneamente a la suscripción del acuerdo, que ya estaba todo arreglado, los prófugos iraníes iban a salir desvinculados fraudulenta y definitivamente del caso por la comisión y quienes iban a salir perjudicados eran aquellos que, de la parte argentina, habían realizado las acusaciones contra los nacionales de Irán. Es más, al día siguiente a la suscripción del acuerdo el agente de inteligencia identificado como “Alian” se comunicó con Khalil y le dijo: “Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me tenías fe...'” (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). Resulta sumamente llamativo este tipo de intercambio entre un funcionario argentino y el referente de Irán, Jorge Khalil. Obviamente las cuestiones en torno al memorando y, fundamentalmente, al encubrimiento, habían sido acordadas de antemano y de allí las expresiones esclarecedoras como “yo te dije, vos no me tenías fe” y “ya ganamos” que dan cuenta que cierto sector de la inteligencia argentina, por decisión presidencial, estaba operando juntamente y en la línea de los intereses de Teherán. Asimismo, conversaron respecto a los miedos que había expresado Khalil respecto al desempeño de Timerman en las negociaciones “...o ver si no la sabe dibujar ...aparte, no la entiende...”. Pero estos temores no importaban porque fue: “...orden, orden, y orden y orden en alusión a que el canciller se limitó a cumplir las órdenes recibidas de la Dra. Fernández (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). Esta conversación también sirve para demostrar que los partícipes sabían perfectamente que era “un dibujo”, es decir, que había que diseñar hábilmente un acuerdo cuya letra no expusiera burdamente el sofisticado plan subyacente. En otra ocasión, “Alian” calculó “...Que en un año y medio tengamos las buenas noticias...”, en solapada alusión a la absolución total de los iraníes en la causa. Y aclaró: “...estamos perfecto, a nivel internacional perfecto... ” y concluyó: “...tranquilo, está CERRADO MUY ARRIBA...'"" (Comunicación del 6/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276). Cabe aclarar que ese “estamos” incluía a Khalil, es decir, a los intereses de Irán. Sin importar las evidencias, los hechos o su verdadera responsabilidad en el atentado, los ciudadanos iraníes iban a ser desvinculados de la causa, se le iba a “lavar la cara ” a Irán y eso estaba “cerrado muy arriba”, es decir, el plan tenía sello presidencial. Esto es de una gravedad institucional inusitada. La orden para ejecutar el delito provino directa y personalmente de la Presidente de la Nación y su instrumentación quedó a cargo de su Canciller, otros funcionarios de menor rango y terceros, que la investigación que V.S. lleve adelante determinará en su justo alcance y medida. No está de más reiterar que el Memorando de Entendimiento firmado entre la República Islámica de Irán y la República Argentina ha sido, ni más ni menos, que el medio seleccionado para presentar al mundo un camuflaje jurídico que disimule un sofisticado plan de impunidad para terroristas internacionales prófugos de la justicia argentina. Son concluyentes las pruebas que determinan que la autora intelectual del plan de encubrimiento para dotar de impunidad a los iraníes señalados por la justicia nacional como responsables del atentado a la AMIA fue la mismísima Presidente de la Nación Argentina, Cristina Fernández. Ahora bien, los autores y partícipes de este encubrimiento habían llegado a la conclusión de que en la actualidad existe un nuevo escenario mundial en el que ha variado el lugar de Irán. Y que este “nuevo mundo” favorecería -en cierto modo- la consecución de este plan criminal, dado que hay intereses y coyunturas que exigen acercarse a Irán, que necesitan “lavarle la cara” y demandan el surgimiento de “nuevos enemigos”. Este nuevo escenario podía contribuir a la credibilidad de la versión inventada para desvincular a los imputados iraníes de la causa AMIA. Mientras Cristina Fernández aseguraba públicamente que no iba a permitir “...que esta desgracia terrible que nos sucedió a los argentinos sea utilizada como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero internacional...” o “...para fines de la geopolítica internacional...”; uno de sus cómplices, “Alian”, reconocía a través de los canales paralelos que: . .ya estamos en otro país, es otra situación mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Existe un nuevo contexto mundial, “estamos en otro país” y se había advertido la necesidad de construir un nuevo culpable por el atentado contra la AMIA. Ya no servía imputar a los ciudadanos iraníes, aunque fueran verdaderamente los responsables del atentado, sino que se pretendía recomponer los vínculos con Irán y con la comunidad iraní local. Las pruebas así lo demuestran. Se ha revelado que: “...va a venir otra hipótesis con otras pruebas...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Es decir, las responsabilidades se iban a determinar por las necesidades políticas y geopolíticas internacionales de los autores. Poco importó lo que indica la prueba. Todo estaba arreglado: se iba a usar el caso AMIA como una pieza para saciar intereses geopolíticos en el nuevo tablero mundial. Vaya ironía las palabras de la Dra. Fernández. Y	cuando aparezca esa nueva tesis y sus pruebas falsas, se dijo que el suscripto iba a quedar totalmente descolocado “...porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas...lo que viene ahora...es una prueba contundente...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Efectivamente, sabían que para deslegitimar al abajo firmante y a la investigación llevada a cabo conforme a derecho, para avanzar con el encubrimiento de los acusados iraníes, necesitaban inventar una nueva -y falsa- hipótesis, con “pruebas nunca vistas”, nunca siquiera presentadas a la causa. Es decir, los partícipes del encubrimiento sabían que se iba a presentar una nueva hipótesis sobre el atentado, pero con “otras pruebas”, más aún, pruebas nunca vistas por el suscripto. Se habló de la fabricación de elementos probatorios falsos para buscar desacreditar la minuciosa investigación vigente y así deslegitimar la acusación que involucra a los imputados iraníes. Ahora bien, resulta una obviedad señalar que la nueva hipótesis debía parecer verosímil. En consecuencia, se decidió recurrir a ciertos individuos que habían tenido contacto con la investigación del caso AMIA, como el caso del otrora Fiscal Federal y ex Juez Nacional de Instrucción, Héctor Luis Yrimia. Este contacto tuvo por fin obtener datos objetivos de la causa que tomaran verosímil lo falso. El Dr. Yrimia intervino como fiscal en los primeros y trascendentales momentos de la pesquisa . Ha tenido acceso al expediente y ha podido contribuir con información para inventar una hipótesis con apoyo en elementos que ya se encuentren incorporados a la causa, lo que conllevaría un mayor grado de credibilidad para la versión inventada. Adviértase que en noviembre de 2012, mucho antes de la suscripción de ningún pacto con Irán, Jorge “Yussuf” Khalil ya se había reunido con el Dr. Yrimia. Así lo relató: “...tengo un par de cosas que contarte...tuve una charla con el fiscal...El fiscal de la causa...el que estaba, no el que está ahora... El que sabe es éste que te digo... el fiscal de la causaPara luego señalar que el contacto con Yrimia le habría llegado a través de Fernando Esteche: “... Y, el que me sienta es Fernando (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012- 11-04-130024-6, CD 182). Estos contactos se corroboraron en una conversación posterior, mantenida en diciembre de 2012, en la que Esteche le avisó a Khalil que “el fiscal de AMIA es de ellos, Yrimia’'' (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). “Ellos”, en alusión a un sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia. Estas referencias indican que el Dr. Yrimia respondería al mismo sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia que “Alian”, quien sostiene: “...Yrimia...es empleado mío ese...está en casi todas, ¿viste?...'’'’ (Comunicación del 7/10/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-10-07-141519- 20, CD 171). Justamente fue Femando Esteche quien sugirió a Yrimia como fuente de información para la fabricación de la nueva hipótesis “eso te puede servir bien concreto para cualquiera de las tesis distintas de....tercer país o lo que fuera, cualquiera de las cosas que vayan a resolverse va a sei-virporque es información” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Clarísimo. Hay varias hipótesis para desplazar a la acusación judicial. Se necesita elegir la mejor, las más creíble, para ello necesitan información veraz y el Dr. Yrimia ha sido una de las fuentes que se ha prestado a proveerla, justamente, porque estuvo en una posición privilegiada de contacto directo con el expediente a raíz de su función como Fiscal del caso AMIA. En suma, para la elaboración de la “nueva hipótesis”, los partícipes tuvieron acceso al Dr. Héctor Yrimia quien, a los fines del plan cuenta con las siguientes “credenciales”: 1) un conocimiento personal específico sobre la causa del atentado, por haber sido, entre otros, uno de los primeros fiscales del caso; 2) se encuentra relacionado con el sector de la secretaría de inteligencia encargado del armado de la nueva hipótesis falsa; 3) tiene relación directa con el agente iraní Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, gracias a la vinculación de éste último con Fernando Esteche; y 4) habla de ello en sus conversaciones con Jorge Khalil. No caben dudas. Yrimia se encontraba en condiciones de aportar información de primera mano de la causa. Y como la decisión de crear un “nuevo culpable” ya había sido tomada, resultó vital contar con información que se apoye en datos ya incorporados a la causa, y que permitan fabricar la más creíble de todas las falsas versiones. Así, en las conversaciones registradas se barajaron distintas ideas relativas a posibles versiones alternativas, como por ejemplo: “no van a poder decir que fueron los israelíes”; se podría culpar a “una conexión de fachos locales”; o “...ellos están denunciando que fueron ellos mismos los del autoatentado. Así, de frente va, y así empezamos a tejer otra varianteo “...si se cae la trafic, olvídate, se cayó todo	no solamente se cayó, sino que se da vuelta...”. (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226, Comunicación del 13/02/2013, abonado -3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-13-184206-28, CD 283 y Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341 -10, CD 284) Y	esa conversación permite demostrar nuevamente que todo ya había sido acordado de antemano. Cuando se sugirió como alternativa de “nueva hipótesis”: “...si se cae la trafic, olvídate, se cayó todo...no solamente se cayó, sino que se da vuelta...”, Khalil señaló: “ya está... ¿Me estás car gando?...y a está, no te puedo hablar, adelantar nada, pero YA ESTÁ TODO” (Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341-10, CD 284, el resaltado es propio). La impunidad había sido ya convenida previamente, por fuera al texto del acuerdo. En síntesis, de las evidencias obtenidas se desprende que el sector de inteligencia dependiente directamente de Presidencia de la Nación, al que responde “Alian”, se abocó a la construcción de un nuevo enemigo, de una nueva hipótesis que permitiera explicar el atentado de algún modo que desvincule a los ciudadanos iraníes acusados, en virtud del plan de encubrimiento que aquí se denuncia. Así, de los pasos que fueron siguiendo los partícipes del encubrimiento, se desprende que la construcción de la pista falsa que aleje la investigación de Teherán implicó la fabricación de pruebas que incriminen a terceros inocentes, y los convertirían en los nuevos imputados y, según todo el relato, los “verdaderos culpables”. Todo quedó en espera por la negativa iraní a firmar el Memorando de Entendimiento, porque permanecieron vigentes las notificaciones rojas. Como se dijo al inicio, la maniobra de encubrimiento conlleva no solamente desvincular por medios fraudulentos a quienes han sido judicial y fundadamente imputados de un hecho criminal, sino que también implica incriminar falsamente a terceros. El objetivo de construir esta falsa teoría alternativa ha sido contribuir a la desincriminación de los acusados iraníes y que finalice para ellos la pesadilla que comenzó en el año 2007, cuando el suscripto logró en Interpol la aceptación de las capturas con notificaciones rojas para los acusados. Los partícipes del encubrimiento así lo entendían. Prueba de ello es lo que expresaban al respecto: “...la esencia del nudo, el núcleo del nudo...es la inocencia de lrán...\o demás viene a colación...”, y también “...es la inocencia de Irán con la inocencia de la comunidad como conexión local,...'’'' (Comunicación del 14/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341 -10, CD 284). La gravedad de estas acciones es fenomenal, máxime si se tiene en cuenta que la decisión primigenia fue tomada por la más alta autoridad pública nacional e involucra a su canciller, a un Diputado Nacional, a cierto sector de la inteligencia argentina y a referentes locales ligados a funcionarios del gobierno, entre otros. Finalmente, mientras los partícipes de este hecho -algunos muy cercanos al entorno presidencial, como el caso de “Alian”, por ejemplo-, reconocían, en	privado,	que	los cambios en el escenario mundial demandaban un nuevo posicionamiento respecto de Irán, que se traduciría en la invención de nuevos responsables para el caso AMIA, con la consecuente remoción del obstáculo que, a entender de las autoridades argentinas, ha impedido la relación bilateral; por su parte, la Sra. Presidente construía un discurso oficial muy distinto a la realidad que manejaban los partícipes de su plan. En	efecto,	Cristina Fernández afirmaba públicamente: “...jamás permitiremos que la tragedia AMIA sea utilizada como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero de intereses geopolíticos ajenos'''' (Mensaje de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 10:32). Y agregaba: “No voy a permitir que esta desgracia terrible que nos sucedió a los argentinos	sea utilizada	como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero internacionar e insistía:	“Yo	no voy a permitir que nadie utilice la desgracia y la tragedia de los argentinos para fines de la geopolítica internacionar (cuenta de twitter de Cristina Kirchner, 04/03/2013 5:08 PM; Mensaje de la Presidenta Cristina Fernández a la Asamblea Legislativa con motivo de la apertura del 131° período de sesiones ordinarias del Congreso de la Nación del 1/03/2013). En este encadenado rosario de mentiras, la mandataria fue secundada -justamente- por su canciller, quien, meses antes, había emitido un comunicado desde el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores que, anunciando un cuarto intermedio en las negociaciones oficiales, rezaba: “...El Gobierno Nacional ratifica que el único compromiso es con las víctimas y el derecho de sus familiares a hallar en la verdad y en la justicia la reparación debida. Argentina reafirma que en dicho objetivo no hay lugar para intereses geopolíticos, ni propios, ni ajenos...'''' (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°360/12, del 31/10/2012, el subrayado es propio). Ni el discurso de la Presidente ni el comunicado del Canciller se ajustaban a la verdad. Ellos mismos eran los protagonistas de un plan que sacrificó la causa por el atentado a la AMIA en pos de intereses ajenos a la búsqueda de justicia. Una Presidente que, públicamente, se regodea manifestando a los sobrevivientes y a los familiares de las víctimas que busca verdad y justicia; que declara que no va a permitir que se utilice el caso AMIA en el ajedrez de la geopolítica mundial; que ha tomado cartas en el asunto porque la causa estaba paralizada, cuando en realidad, ha dado la orden de desarticular la causa y encubrir a los acusados. Da pavor, entonces, constatar que todo se trata de actuación y manipulación de hechos y personas pues, lo cierto es que esa misma Presidente ha ordenado a su Canciller, a funcionarios de su servicio de inteligencia y a personas afines a su gobierno que ejecuten un plan delictivo, decidido por ella misma, y que construyan una hipótesis falsa para terminar con la acusación a los iraníes en el expediente AMIA. d)	Indicios de un acuerdo secreto firmado con Irán por fuera del Memorando de Entendimiento Al anunciar la suscripción del acuerdo desde Adís Abeba, Etiopía, el Ministro Timerman se vio en la necesidad de aclarar:	Este acuerdo se logró en un diálogo directo con Irán y no existen cláusulas secretas ni ningún otro tema con el gobierno de ese país... ” (Declaraciones de Timerman al finalizar el acuerdo con su par de Irán para investigar el atentado de la AMIA, Casa Rosada, Presidencia de la Nación, 27/01/2013). No se entendía cuál era la razón para semejante aclaración. Se supone que este acuerdo no debería contener cláusulas secretas u ocultas. El correr de los meses le otorgaría el verdadero sentido a aquella manifestación preventiva del Canciller. En mayo de 2013, cuando Jorge “Yussuf” Khalil comunicó la desazón que había encontrado en Teherán por el tema de las notificaciones rojas, expuso llanamente lo que realmente había ocurrido, al decir: “...hay un poquito de...esto entre nosotros ...hay un poquito de desazón de allá... Desazón...si, si, si...me parece que....Me parece que el ruso este de mierda se mandó alguna...estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares  también parece...” (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-1 l-083146-8.wav, CD 0022). Las palabras de Khalil dejan entrever la existencia de otro documento firmado en el que estaba incluido el tema de la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Es decir, un documento más amplio que lo incluido en la letra del memorando de entendimiento del 27 de enero de 2013. Esto se corrobora con las declaraciones del canciller iraní Salehi quien en marzo de 2013 expresó: “...El [contenido] del acuerdo entre Irán y Argentina en relación con la cuestión de la AMIA será hecho público en el momento adecuado y la cuestión [de los imputados iraníes] está incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo...”, en obvia alusión a un pacto distinto al memorando (“Tehran insists accord with Argentina includes interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects”, Mercopress, 19/03/2013). A ello debe sumarse otro episodio revelador de la existencia de pactos secretos entre ambas partes. Hubo indicios certeros que pusieron en duda que verdaderamente se fueran a llevar a cabo las audiencias en Teherán, aun cuando las mismas ni siquiera constituyeran verdaderas declaraciones indagatorias para la ley argentina. De hecho, el vocero de la cancillería iraní, Ramin Mehmanparast, declaró: “...El tema de la indagatoria de un responsable iraní [por Vahidi] es totalmente falso...Parece que los que se inquietan por este acuerdo difunden este tipo de informaciones...” (“Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/02/2013). Los medios informaron al respecto que: “...El portavoz del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Irán, Ramin Mehmanparast, dijo que la solicitud para la interrogación de algunos de los funcionarios de la República Islámica de Irán en el marco de la revisión del caso AMIA, no es cierta...” (“Mehmanparast: solicitud para interrogar a funcionarios iraníes sobre el caso AMIA, es falsa”, IR1B, 11/02/2013). Al día siguiente, el Canciller Salehi declaró: “...Hemos firmado un acuerdo con la Argentina sobre la solución del caso AMIA y las dos partes se han comprometido a ello...” (“El canciller de Irán dice que negoció durante dos años el acuerdo con Argentina”, Clarín, 12/02/2013). Entonces, para intentar aquietar la nueva polémica en ciernes, en pleno tratamiento parlamentario del acuerdo, el Ministro Timerman brindó al siguiente explicación sobre las declaraciones de los iraníes, dirigiéndose a un Senador de la Nación: “... Usted dijo que ayer el gobierno iraní negó que se vaya a interrogar a los sospechosos ¡quién lo dijo? Un vocero. ¿Sus voceros hablan por usted o usted habla por usted? Porque el canciller iraní, el doctor Salehi, una hora después, dijo que Irán va a cumplir con todos los puntos del Memorándum ¡Le cree más a los voceros que al propio canciller?...” (Palabras de Héctor Timerman, versión taquigráfica del Plenario de Comisiones, Cámara de Senadores, Honorable Congreso de la Nación, del día 13 de febrero de 2013). Pero era una falacia. Una más. Salehi no había desmentido lo que afirmó su propio vocero. Sería extraño. Su portavoz había transmitido un mensaje importante y certero. Salehi solo había reafirmado su compromiso a cumplir el pacto y ello, en modo alguno significaba que el entonces Ministro de Defensa tuviera que comparecer a las audiencias previstas en el acuerdo. Con su fallido intento de interpretar la voluntad íntima del régimen iraní mejor que los funcionarios persas, el Canciller Timerman ocultó lo que verdaderamente estaba ocurriendo: la ejecución del plan encubridor aquí expuesto. De hecho, la prueba fehaciente de la existencia de un pacto secreto entre Salehi y Timerman por el cual se acordó que Ahmad Vahidi jamás concurriera a esas audiencias, surge de la comunicación entre Jorge Khalil y Luis D'Elía que se transcribe a continuación: D’Elía: Ahí infobae está tirando que rechazaron la indagatoria de Vahidi ¿qué sabés? Khalil: No, no sé nada Luis. D’Elía: ¿eh? Khalil: No sé nada. D’Elía:	Porque viste, esto va.....justo un día antes del debate parlamentario... Khalil: Pero....eh... D’Elía: ¿No será pescado podrido eso? Khalil: Si, pescado podrido. Después hablamos personalmente y te cuento. D’Elía: Pero no me dejes... ¿por qué es pescado podrido? Khalil: Pero boludo, no puedo decirte por teléfono cómo viene la mano, pero....está dentro del marco, Luis. D’Elía: Ah, ah....ok, ok, ¿fue conversado antes? Khalil: Claro, bolas, claro. No puedo hablar por teléfono, este teléfono de mierda está re pinchado y el tuyo está más pinchado que el mío todavía. D’Elía: Pero ¿se sabía de antes?... ¿no es sorpresa? Khalil: No. D’Elía: Bueno. Khalil: Fue un...ambas partes, se sabía. D’Elía: Ah Khalil: Es más profundo todavía Luis, yo te tengo que explicar. (Comunicación del 12/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-12-100525-14, CD 282). Es decir, ya no se trataba solamente de la caída de las notificaciones rojas. También se acordó que, en la práctica, el entonces Ministro de Defensa iraní y actual prófugo de la justicia argentina, Ahmad Vahidi, jamás se sentaría a prestar declaración, sin importar lo que dijese la letra del Memorando. Ello estaba acordado entre las partes, ya había sido “conversado antes ” y, según se sugiere de la conversación, el acuerdo era “más profundo todavía Esta prueba revela, en forma contundente, la existencia de acuerdos secretos por fuera de la letra del memorando, alguno de ellos escritos y firmados, que incluyen cuestiones que no pueden trascender a la opinión pública. Ello contribuye, a la acreditación del plan aquí denunciado, dado que todo lo que abiertamente concierne al mismo ha sido -en principio- escondido del escrutinio público. e)	Mohsen Rabbani y el plan de impunidad Durante este plan criminal, los distintos avances fueron inmediatamente comunicados a uno de los prófugos de la justicia argentina, acusado por su participación en el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA y beneficiario directo del encubrimiento que se denuncia: Mohsen Rabbani. Cada paso del plan y cada mensaje que llegó a conocimiento del agente de Teherán en Buenos Aires, Jorge Khalil, fueron comunicados al imputado Mohsen Rabbani. Se han registrado comunicaciones telefónicas que constituyen insoslayables ejemplos de ello: “...hoy terminamos una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas...”, a lo que Rabbani respondió:	“...Mándame para que evalúe...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31). Así, las propuestas del gobierno argentino fueron puestas a evaluación y decisión de uno de los acusados por el atentado terrorista quien, luego de evaluarlo, contestó: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina...y también comprar armas...” (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Esto demuestra varias cuestiones. Primero, Rabbani goza de un enorme poder decisorio y peso político dentro del régimen, lo cual le ha permitido intervenir personalmente en las negociaciones con sus encubridores. Este imputado prófugo tiene capacidad de decisión en las cuestiones comerciales entre ambos Estados que, como también se ha denunciado, constituyeron un motor central para avanzar con este encubrimiento. Todo esto indica que el mismísimo Rabbani ha intervenido indirectamente -a través de intermediarios como Jorge Khalil- en las negociaciones comerciales que motorizaron, nada más y nada menos que su propio encubrimiento. Y todo ello, a espaldas del conocimiento público. Segundo y teniendo en cuenta que la reunión con el Ministro Julio De Vido fue llevada a cabo “porque lo pidió la jefa ” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 111124-8, CD 31), queda probado uno de los modos en que los mensajes y las propuestas enviadas por Cristina Fernández, a través de su Ministro de Planificación Federal Julio De Vido, del operador Luis D'Elía y del nexo con Teherán, Jorge Khalil, llegaron al imputado Mohsen Rabbani. En otras palabras, la Sra. Presidente de la Nación Dra. Cristina Fernández negoció, por interpósitas personas, con el prófugo Mohsen Rabbani, sobre distintas cuestiones vinculadas al encubrimiento que los unía en la dupla delictiva de encubridora y encubierto. Tercero. El caso aquí registrado permite demostrar que mientras públicamente la Dra. Fernández aseguraba que el acuerdo venía a contribuir con la causa judicial; secreta y clandestinamente negociaba petróleo con uno de los sospechosos del mayor acto terrorista que sufrió nuestro país. Y Rabbani, en vez de estar preocupado por su situación procesal, orquestaba la negociación por petróleo impulsada por la Sra. Presidenta, en torno a su propio encubrimiento, encarando la posibilidad de comprar armas a la Argentina. Cuarto. Esta posibilidad de comprar armas a la Argentina fue comunicada por Mohsen Rabbani a una persona de su entorno, Adalberto Assad, quien ese mismo día venía de reunirse con un funcionario del gobierno argentino, quien iba intermediar para conseguirle una reunión personal con la Sra. Presidente (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Quinto. Este intercambio telefónico revela también que Mohsen Rabbani seguía y sigue de cerca las reuniones y negociaciones que giran en torno al acuerdo que, como aquí se denuncia, tiene por norte -entre otras cuestiones- su encubrimiento personal. Gracias a Khalil, Rabbani estaba mejor informado que los familiares y víctimas del atentado, que la dirigencia judía local y que las autoridades judiciales argentinas, ninguno de los cuales, al mes de mayo de 2013, conocía estas tratativas. Hay otros ejemplos de Mohsen Rabbani negociando, enviando mensajes a sus intermediarios, para que lleguen eventualmente al despacho presidencial: '''‘...Irán quiere buenas relaciones, nosotros verdad es así, que Irán quiere buenas relaciones...Y eso que está Irán creciendo, entonces debe aprovechar lo más rápido y posible ahora que ellos quieren...”. Del mismo modo, ha recibido mensajes que responden: “...Ellos también...el gobierno también quiere tener una buena relación...”, en referencia al gobierno argentino (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Existen también ejemplos de comunicaciones con Rabbani que prueban que estaba informado de cada aspecto vinculado a su situación procesal, a la causa AMIA en general, al acercamiento de Teherán con Buenos Aires y, naturalmente, al Memorando de Entendimiento, vía para su impunidad (Comunicación del 27/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2013-02-27-125331-24, CD 297, Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31, Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 05-28-155549-2, CD 39; Comunicación del 24/11/13, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-11 -24-103813-4, CD 219 y Comunciación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-04-093431-30, CD 291). En el marco de este plan criminal, Jorge Khalil ha sido la persona de confianza de Rabbani, que le ha reportado constantemente desde Buenos Aires: “...Sheik, quédese tranquilo que yo hoy a la noche, cuando llego a mi casa, le mando un informe de todo todo lo que estoy haciendo.. ”, demostrando -una vez más- su subordinación a Mohsen Rabbani (Comunicación del 20/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-20-160302-28, CD 276). Rabbani ha reconocido este lazo en distintas oportunidades: “lo maltrato a usted en la confianza porque usted es responsable de todo” (Comunicación del 13/2/13, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-13-184206-28, CD 283 y del Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 02-14-164341-10, CD 284), o “...no mezcle más las cosas. Usted trabaja conmigo...” (Comunicación del 24/11/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-11-24-103813-4, CD 219). Además, estos contactos demuestran acabadamente que Mohsen Rabbani, desde Irán, sigue decidiendo y operando para el régimen de Teherán, enviando financiamiento para sustentar la estructura que supo construir en territorio argentino durante la década que precedió al atentado contra la sede de la AMIA y que continua sosteniéndola hasta la fecha con la asistencia de su entorno (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31, Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39; Comunicación del 19/1/2014, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo IN- 12177-20140119-003044, CD 49; Comunicación del 20/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-20-160302-28, CD 276, Comunciación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014- 02-04-093431-30, CD 291). Pero fundamentalmente, las circunstancias registradas en las comunicaciones obtenidas por orden judicial, son un ejemplo flagrante de cómo ciertas autoridades del gobierno nacional argentino han estado negociando y acordando estrategias conjuntas, intermediarios mediante, con uno de los imputados por su participación en el atentado terrorista contra la AMIA. El próximo punto detallará todas las acciones que la Sra. Presidente, el Sr. Canciller y otros partícipes del encubrimiento han llevado adelante para cumplir acabadamente con su plan delictivo. V.- Acciones para impulsar el plan criminal: a)	La campaña del descrédito El plan encubridor incluyó paralelamente una estrategia mediática y discursiva destinada a horadar la credibilidad de la justicia argentina y de los funcionarios a cargo de la investigación del atentado, achacándoles que la causa se encontraba paralizada, además de falta de objetividad y fundamentalmente permeabilidad a la influencia de intereses ajenos a la búsqueda de la verdad y la justicia. Se trató de una verdadera y, por cierto, nefasta campaña de descrédito a la actual investigación judicial del caso AMIA, en lo que ha sido otro de los medios para concretar el plan encubridor, dado que la deslegitimación de la acusación permite presentar, públicamente, y dar verosimilitud a las “nuevas hipótesis” y a los “nuevos” autores del hecho y, de esa forma, permitir la desvinculación de los acusados iraníes y, principalmente, de Teherán, de todo involucramiento terrorista en el caso. El descrédito no es inocuo, sino que contribuye a la finalidad del encubrimiento aquí denunciado. a.	1) La causa está 11armada ” Este cliché ha sido la primera punta de lanza para intentar cuestionar la certera investigación judicial argentina que ha logrado determinar, en gran medida, los responsables del atentado ocurrido en Buenos Aires el 18 de julio de 1994. Por otra parte, ha sido desde siempre la versión oficial del régimen de Teherán. Simplemente, una estrategia comunicacional y de defensa que, para la República Islámica de Irán, ha resultado exitosa. Según esta falsa premisa, existen intereses extranjeros promovidos por facciones políticas procedentes de Israel y/o Estados Unidos que han logrado influenciar y manipular a la justicia argentina para que fabrique la acusación que involucra a ciudadanos iraníes en el atentado contra la AMIA, con el objeto de deslegitimar y dañar la reputación internacional de la República Islámica de Irán, atribuyéndole la responsabilidad por un hecho de terrorismo en Sudamérica. Ninguna prueba existe de estas acusaciones hechas a la ligera. No podría haberla tampoco pues sencillamente la pretendida manipulación de potencias extranjeras nunca sucedió y las conclusiones de la investigación son, ni más ni menos, que el resultado del análisis de la prueba que obra en el expediente. Que la evidencia reunida guste o no a determinado sector o país es una cuestión absolutamente ajena al suscripto. Ahora bien, a partir de la puesta en marcha del plan de encubrimiento por parte de ciertas autoridades del gobierno argentino, la campaña de descrédito, hasta ese momento exclusivamente orquestada desde Teherán, experimentó un sutil giro que le ha otorgado una impronta distinta. Las más altas autoridades de la nación, incluida la Presidente y el Canciller, lejos de oponerse a la retórica iraní parecieron adherirse a ella y contribuyeron a aumentar las expresiones de deslegitimación y descrédito. Anteriormente, Luis D'Elía había actuado como vocero local de esta versión, pero ello le costó su puesto en el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner, que no permitió que ninguno de sus funcionarios pusiera infundadamente en duda las conclusiones del Poder Judicial y el Ministerio Público Fiscal. D'Elía nunca dejó de comunicar esta versión falsa y deslegitimadora. En ese contexto, mientras D'Elía operaba aseverando que intereses extranjeros habían logrado influenciar y manipular a la justicia argentina para fabricar la acusación contra Irán, la Sra. Presidente reforzaba la retórica a través de su cuenta de “twitter”, manifestando: “...jamás permitiremos que la tragedia AMIA sea utilizada como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero de intereses geopoliticos ajenos” (Mensaje de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 10:32). Esta frase fue celebrada por el mismo D'Elía, quien destacó que la Sra. Presidente había hecho referencia a la utilización del tema AMIA en cuestiones geopolíticas de otros Estados (“Causa AMIA: Para D'Elía, los acusados iraníes van a ser sobreseídos”, Infobae, 1/3/2013). Consterna constatar que la causa AMIA, a contramano de lo expresado por la Presidente Fernández, fue usufructuada como pieza de cambio para lograr el restablecimiento de la relación comercial bilateral con la República Islámica de Irán, en función de un cambio en la visión geopolítica. a.	2) La causa está paralizada Con el objeto de lograr el apoyo de la opinión pública y el aval parlamentario, estratégicamente se intentó presentar al Memorando de Entendimiento -pieza importante en el plan encubridor- como la única alternativa posible para avanzar en la causa, como el camino que había que transitar, no porque fuera ideal -nadie podría creer que lo fuera- sino porque ya no quedaban otras alternativas y no había nada que perder. De esa manera, se pretendió instalar la idea de que la causa judicial por el atentado se encontraba completamente paralizada desde hace años. Con esta afirmación, totalmente falsa, se buscó estratégicamente crear el ánimo en el público de que el memorando aportaba la única posibilidad de avanzar en la causa y que, si bien no era ideal y ciertos aspectos eran perfectibles, era mejor que la parálisis del expediente. En suma, falso pero se dijo que no se perdía nada intentando esta opción. SCAL Para sostener este argumento, Timerman dijo: “...Por primera vez hay un compromiso por escrito de Irán...para que la causa “AMIA ” pueda salir de la total parálisis actual en la que se encuentra. Repito, la total parálisis actual en la que se encuentra...” y, luego, aclaró que se refería al “....proceso judicial en curso, que no ha tenido avances de ningún tipo en los últimos años” y advirtió a los legisladores: “Serán ustedes quienes decidan si la causa avanza o sigue paralizada''’ y posteriormente agregó: “La causa está paralizada desde el año 2006” y “Le recuerdo que van 19 años sin que hayamos logrado un avance significativo” (Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Asuntos Constitucionales y de Justicia y Asuntos Penales de la Cámara de Senadores desarrollado el 13 de febrero de 2013). Similares expresiones repitió ante el plenario de comisiones de la Cámara de Diputados (cfr. versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Justicia y Asuntos Constitucionales de la Cámara de Diputados, Congreso Nacional, desarrollado el 26 de febrero de 2013). Por su parte, en su discurso ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, la Sra. Presidente afirmó: “...la causa está estancada, desde hace 19 años no se moviliza...” (Discurso de Cristina Fernández, 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2013). Y meses antes, al elevar el acuerdo con Irán al Congreso para su aprobación, había aseverado en Cadena Nacional: “Este Memorándum que hemos acordado es un paso adelante para destrabar una causa que hace 19 años está paralizada...’''’ (Discurso de Cristina Fernández, Cadena Nacional del día 08/02/2013). En marzo de 2013, la Sra. Presidente escribió en las redes sociales: “Teníamos que destrabar esto”, en alusión a la causa AMIA (ver twitter del 04/03/2013 5:05 PM) y ante la Asamblea Legislativa: “...mi compromiso es intentar destrabar esto...''’’ (Mensaje de la Presidente Cristina Fernández a la Asamblea Legislativa con motivo de la Apertura del 131° período de sesiones ordinarias del Congreso de la Nación, 01/03/2013). En línea con la Presidente y el Canciller, otros funcionarios y representantes cercanos al entorno presidencial hicieron declaraciones de igual tenor. El entonces Senador Daniel Filmus sostuvo que el acuerdo “destraba la causa AMIA”, la cual “no se mueve desde 2006” y agregó que si bien: “no se puede garantizar el éxito cien por cien del memorándum, se sabe que la causa así congelada va directo al fracaso” (“Duro cruce de acusaciones entre Timerman y García Moritán”, La Nación, 19/02/2013). El Senador Nacional Miguel Ángel Pichetto, también afirmó en su alocución que “...la causa tiene una parálisis desde el año 2006...” (Versión taquigráfica del plenario de comisiones del Honorable Senado de la Nación, 13 de febrero de 2013). Por lo demás, tamañas falsedades obligan a quien suscribe a enumerar aquí, aunque sea en forma somera, los significativos avances que ha tenido el expediente desde el año 2006, fecha en la cual se dictaron las órdenes de captura internacional que fueran avaladas por amplia mayoría en la Asamblea General de Interpol en noviembre de 2007. Al año siguiente, 2008, se concluyó la labor que dio lugar a la denuncia por otro encubrimiento verificado en este caso, que beneficiara al imputado de Alberto Jacinto Kanoore Edul y que actualmente se encuentra en etapa de juicio oral. A fines de 2008 se dictaron los embargos preventivos contra las propiedades de los acusados, resultando en la inhibición registral de algunos bienes que Mohsen Rabbani posee en nuestro país. En 2009 la Fiscalía a cargo del abajo firmante emitió un nuevo dictamen relativo al atentado. Allí se plasmó el trabajo relacionado con la identificación del coche bomba utilizado en el ataque y se explicó en detalle el funcionamiento de la célula terrorista de Hezbollah que actuó en la ejecución material del hecho. Incluso se pudo establecer la identidad y la participación del jefe de dicho grupo operativo, el libanés Samuel Salman El Reda, a quien se le atribuye haber coordinado la llegada y la partida, las  Al BERTO NISM .:!SCA'- ó'  Ministerio Público de la Nación operaciones de logística y las demás actividades desplegadas por el grupo operativo encargado de ejecutar la fase final del atentado. Sobre este sujeto también se dictó orden de captura nacional e internacional y la máxima prioridad de búsqueda de Interpol. En ese pronunciamiento, se determinó que El Reda era un miembro activo del Hezbollah libanés, de una probada vinculación con destacados personajes radicados en la Triple Frontera, pertenecientes a esa organización. La labor de esta Unidad Fiscal también logró demostrar que El Reda conocía, cuanto menos desde 1987, la Ciudad de Buenos Aires y al imputado Mohsen Rabbani, y que su inserción en el medio local se fortaleció con su casamiento en 1989 con una mujer argentina: Silvina Sain. Esta vinculación con Buenos Aires y, fundamentalmente, con Mohsen Rabbani, sumada a la pertenencia de El Reda al Hezbollah, permitió trazar un puente eficaz entre la agrupación a nivel regional y el entonces gobierno de la República Islámica de Irán, cuyos máximos responsables políticos fueron imputados por el atentado. La prueba reunida reflejó que, para el año del atentado, Samuel Salman El Reda residía en la Ciudad de Foz de Iguazú, pero que habitaba alternadamente entre esa localización y la vivienda de sus suegros en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires. Tal alternancia entre los domicilios de Brasil y Argentina fue aprovechada por el nombrado para desarrollar sus tareas, ya que no llamaba a sospecha en razón de sus contactos familiares. A su vez, se logró probar que El Reda estuvo en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires en diversas épocas, y más precisamente, para la fecha próxima a la ejecución del atentado; como así también que el nombrado deliberadamente omitía dejar asentados sus movimientos migratorios, con el único objetivo de dificultar eventuales investigaciones y el seguimiento de sus pasos, y en lo que respecta al atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, dicha ausencia de registro de sus comprobados traslados de un país a otro solo pudo ser entendida como una actividad enmarcada en la función que llevó adelante en esa operación. Otra circunstancia acreditada por esta fiscalía, en lo que hace particularmente al protagonismo de El Reda en la ejecución del ataque contra la mutual judía, es su intervención en las comunicaciones telefónicas que efectuó, ya que teniendo en cuenta a quiénes las realizó, desde dónde y cuándo las hizo, pudo concluirse que en tales contactos el nombrado transmitió información indispensable para la ejecución del hecho y cumplió una función de coordinación en la llegada y la partida, las operaciones de logística y las demás actividades desplegadas por el grupo operativo, ya sea respecto de los restantes agentes involucrados en la operación que, como él, actuaron a nivel local, como con quien lo hacía desde la zona de la Triple Frontera mediante un abonado celular a nombre de André Marques. Tales comunicaciones fueron extrictamente necesarias e imprescindibles para que la operación concluyera de la manera en que lo hizo, al punto que el operativo no hubiera podido arribar a su fase final de no ser por la intervención de El Reda en los momentos y desde los lugares donde la llevó a cabo. En relación a estas comunicaciones telefónicas, se tuvo en cuenta, en primer lugar, que las mismas fueron efectuadas desde lugares estratégicos, en función del atentado (terminales aéreas desde las que ingresó y egresó, cuanto menos, parte de los ejecutores del plan, como así también locutorios cercanos al objetivo). En segundo lugar, que fueron llamadas dirigidas, en algunos casos, a abonados correspondientes a centrales de comunicaciones de Hezbollah en Beirut (República del Líbano), como así también al abonado a nombre de André Marques, cuyo usuario se trató de un militante activo de Hezbollah, que también tuvo a su cargo la coordinación de acciones y agentes desde la Triple Frontera. Y en tercer y último lugar, se consideró también que los contactos se produjeron del Io al 18 de julio de 1994, habiéndose probado previamente que el abonado a nombre de Marques solo había recibido comunicaciones desde nuestro país entre esas fechas, ni antes ni después, lo que significa que ese teléfono se activó durante un período determinado y con un objetivo concreto: coordinar las tareas desarrolladas con el fin de atentado contra la sede de la AMIA. En ese dictamen, quedó probado que los dos primeros llamados al abonado a nombre de André Marques -Triple Frontera- se registraron el 1 de julio, desde cabinas localizadas en el Aeropuerto Internacional de Ezeiza, y el último, el 18 de julio, desde otra ubicada en el Aeroparque Metropolitano Jorge Newbery, tan solo dos horas antes de que estallara el artefacto explosivo que destruyó el edificio de la AMIA. La circunstancia de que tanto el primero como el útlimo llamado registrado hayan sido realizados desde sendos aeopuertos llevó a concluir que se había informado al miembro activo de Hezbollah que operaba a nombre de André Marques, tanto la entrada como la salida de integrantes del grupo operativo que llevaron adelante la etapa final de la misión. En definitiva, la labor de la Unidad Fiscal logró demostrar de manera sólida y contundente que Samuel Salman El Reda tuvo un papel determinante en el marco del apoyo local con el que contó la operación de atentar contra la sede de la AMIA. Asimismo, en ese dictamen se	brindó un extenso informe, de más de cien	páginas,	acerca de las tareas de	esta Unidad Fiscal tendientes a individualizar la carrocería que se usó para el armado del coche bomba que explotó en la AMIA. Luego de la aplicación de adecuados filtros para depurar los extensos listados estudiados y un riguroso análisis posterior, se logró reducir el número posible de camionetas a cuatro unidades, entre las que -y así se concluyó- se encuentra la utilizada para el armado del coche bomba. A partir	de 2010 y a raíz de los pronunciamientos de la Corte Suprema	de	Justicia	de la Nación y de la	Cámara Nacional de Casación Penal del año anterior, en relación a la situación procesal de Carlos Telleldín, se comenzó la tarea de revisión de los elementos probatorios que surgían en contra del nombrado, lo que desembocó en un nueva solicitud de elevación ajuicio respecto de Telleldín, en el mes de agosto de 2012. En 2013, en virtud de la actividad investigativa realizada por esta fiscalía, que incluyó la obtención de testimonios en el extranjero, y de la prueba recolectada en los dos años anteriores -justamente relacionada con actividades ilegales de agentes al servicio del régimen de Teherán- se emitió un nuevo pronunciamiento de más de 500 páginas, en el cual se estableció la modalidad del régimen iraní para infiltrar varios países de Sudamérica e instalar allí estaciones de inteligencia destinadas a cometer, fomentar y patrocinar actos terroristas, en consonancia con sus postulados de exportación de la revolución. La obtención de esta información ha sido central para contextualizar, regional y estratégicamente, el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, así como también para acreditar con mayor detalle el rol del imputado Mohsen Rabbani en dicho ataque. En este dictamen, se demostró que el contexto en el que se llevó adelante el atentado contra la mutual judía, no se trató de un hecho aislado, sino que resultó ser un engranaje de un entramado mucho mayor, dominado por la política de penetración iraní en la región. Paralelamente a todas estas líneas de investigación y sus correspondientes pronunciamientos, la Unidad Fiscal se encuentra diariamente abocada a la profundización de la pesquisa sobre el atentado, y ello queda plasmado en el cuerpo principal de la causa y, actualmente, en 27 legajos que corren por cuerda y se encuentran en pleno trámite. Es útil recordar que el Sr. Canciller tomó conocimiento, a poco tiempo de asumir su función ministerial, esto es, a mediados de 2010, que - entre los distintos frentes de la pesquisa- se estaba avanzando en una nueva línea de investigación relacionada con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani, su rol y su red de contactos a nivel regional, que luego desembocaría en el pronunciamiento de mayo de 2013. El Ministro dijo haber aportado un dato a la fiscalía sobre esta línea de investigación. Se refería a una alerta del servidor “google”, que había recibido por correo electrónico. En sus palabras, Timerman declaró: “...pude conectar que un atentado que se frustró en Estados Unidos al aeropuerto JFK involucraba a Mohsen Rabbani, el que era agregado cultural de la embajada de Irán en Buenos Aires. No lo sabía ni Hillary Clinton ni la gente que investiga acá. Ahora hay una conexión entre un atentado que se frustró en Estados Unidos y el de la AMIA...” (Cibeira, Fernando. “Hay que relacionarse sin intermediarios” Reportaje a Héctor Timerman, Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Página 12, 9/01/2011). De hecho, en sus presentaciones ante las comisiones parlamentarias del Congreso Nacional en ocasión en que se discutía la aprobación de memorando de entendimiento, Héctor Timerman recordó: “(...) el fiscal le va a decir quién le proveyó la principal prueba que tiene en este momento contra la República Islámica del Irán. Y se va a llevar una sorpresa porque fui yo. Yo sí cooperé en la investigación (...) Concretamente, esa prueba fue la que lo habilitó a él a un montón de averiguaciones que ojalá algún día podamos presentarlas en un juicio... ”N (versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Justicia y Asuntos Constitucionales de la Cámara de Diputados, Congreso Nacional, desarrollado el 26 de febrero de 2013). Es decir, el Sr. Timerman tenía conocimiento fehaciente de avances concretos en la causa y lo reconoció ante el Congreso Nacional. Sin embargo, tres meses después, cruzaba los desiertos sirios para contactarse con Irán y negociar la suspensión de las investigaciones a cambio de retomar el flujo comercial entre Estados, sin dudar luego en justificar este curso de acción afirmando en repetidas ocasiones que la causa estaba “paralizada”. Esta falacia quedó más expuesta aun el 29 de mayo de 2013, cuando la fiscalía a cargo del suscripto, como se adelantó párrafos atrás, emitió un extenso pronunciamiento -justamente, en relación con la línea de investigación conocida por el Canciller Timerman- en el que se expusieron hechos y pruebas que permitieron saber en forma más acabada el contexto político y regional en el que tuvo lugar el atentado contra la sede de la 14	Se refiere a la conexión entre el imputado por el caso AMIA: Mohsen Rabbani, y al actualmente condenado a prisión perpetua Abdul Kadir (fs. 133.113/133.416 de los autos principales). AMIA y, en particular, el rol de Mohsen Rabbani en el mismo (fs. 133.113/133.416). Al conocerse este documento, el Canciller varió su anterior postura y declaró: “No he visto mucho de novedoso”, en un intento por deslucir las averiguaciones del Ministerio Público, sin advertir que su demérito desacreditaba el aporte del que tanto se había vanagloriado ante los legisladores nacionales y que hasta -por su relevancia- había comunicado a la Secretaria de Estado norteamericana Sra. Hillary Clinton (Pisani, Silvia, “El Congreso de EEUU invitó al fiscal Nisman por su informe de Irán”, La Nación, 14 de junio de 2013). Finalmente, aseverar que “no hay nada que perder” constituye un nuevo engaño argumentativo destinado a justificar el camino del memorando de entendimiento que, como hoy ya se sabe, es el camino de la impunidad de los acusados iraníes por el atentado contra la AMIA. Cabe tener presente que pende sobre la causa la posibilidad de que, nuevamente, sea acribillada de nulidades si se avanza con acciones procesales no previstas por la ley y contrarias a la Constitución Nacional y los principios de derechos público previstos en ella. Es falso que no haya riesgos. En los hechos, como se verá, ya se han producido perjuicios, pues terceros países han cesado, a partir de la firma del acuerdo, en el envío de información. Concluyendo, lo único que necesita ser destrabado en esta causa es la firme negativa de Irán a extraditar a sus nacionales, para ponerlos a disposición de la justicia argentina. El memorando de entendimiento está lejos de solucionar este problema. La causa judicial no necesita “destrabarse” y -menos aun- cabe aseverar de forma irresponsable y falaz que la misma se encuentre paralizada desde el año 2006, como se dijo. Semejantes afirmaciones sólo pueden motivarse en lograr el desprestigio de la justicia argentina, en convalidar el memorando y -como se pudo determinar ahora- en avanzar con el plan encubridor en curso. b)	La campaña del engaño: La tergiversación mediática de la realidad procesal del expediente AMIA que la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller llevaron adelante en tomo al proceso de negociación con la República Islámica de Irán fue necesaria, aunque no suficiente. Debió desplegarse, además, toda una artillería de falsedades, de promesas que los funcionarios nombrados sabían perfectamente que nunca cumplirían, de puestas en escenas y demás estrategias comunicacionales falaces, cuyo único objetivo ha sido predisponer favorablemente a la opinión pública en relación con la negociación con Irán y, en particular, respecto al Memorando de Entendimiento, con el fin último de encubrir a los acusados y desvincularlos de la legítima acusación que pesa sobre ellos. Con ese norte, los encubridores han mentido sobre el momento en que verdaderamente se habían iniciado las negociaciones, sobre la entidad de las cuestiones negociadas y sobre cuál de las partes había propiciado e impulsado el acercamiento. Por los mismos motivos, se ocultó la predisposición que evidenciaron los representantes argentinos para dejar a un lado la justicia en el caso AMIA en favor de la agenda comercial, así como por razones geopolíticas, falseando -de ese modo- los verdaderos motivos del pacto, es decir, los intereses subyacentes a esta decisión. Por ello también se recurrió a intermediarios clandestinos y a reuniones “pantalla” para avanzar con la negociación secreta. Por ello se desmintió y se cuestionó a la prensa cuando comunicó circunstancias de la negociación que se habían pretendido mantener en secreto. Por ello se atacó a ex funcionarios del gobierno que confirmaron la existencia de antecedentes al pacto que, justamente por sus implicancias ilegales, no habían prosperado en el pasado. Por ello, se afirmó falsamente, y con conocimiento de esa falsedad, que la causa judicial estaba paralizada, que no había otra salida ni nada que perder al apoyar al memorando. Estas fueron, en líneas generales, algunas de las acciones positivas que Cristina Fernández, Héctor Timerman y demás partícipes de este plan de encubrimiento llevaron adelante como parte de la campaña de descrédito. Ya se han detallado los modos en que la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller intentaron justificar la negociación con Irán diciendo que la causa se hallaba paralizada, cuando bien sabían que no era así. Ahora se detallarán sus siguientes aportes al plan delictivo. Conociendo que el Memorando de Entendimiento se trataba simplemente de un disfraz jurídico para camuflar el encubrimiento de los prófugos iraníes, la Sra. Presidente lo presentó como un “logro histórico”. El día en que se firmó, en su cuenta oficial de “Twitter”, anunció: “Histórico: Después de casi 19 años del atentado AMIA se logra, x Io vez, instrumento legal de DERECHO INTERNACIONAL, entre Argentina/Irán ...Histórico: Porque se garantiza el derecho de debido proceso legal, principio fundamental del derecho penal internacional ...al conformarse comisión de verdad de cinco juristas internacionales de reconocido prestigio...Ninguno de ellos podrá ser nacional de ninguno de los 2 países. Imprescindible STANDARD de INDEPENDENCIA...Histórico:	Porque	autoridades judiciales argentinas podrán por Io vez interrogar a quienes Interpol ha emitido notificación roja...Histórico: Pq el acuerdo entre Argentina/Irán deberá ser tratado y ratificado por parlamentos de ambos países. Alto standard institucional. Histórico: Porque Irán no estaba obligado por ninguna resolución o instrumento del derecho internacional ...ni ningún organismo multilateral -x ej. ONU- a dialogar con Argentina y mucho menos a firmar un acuerdo. Histórico, porque jamás permitiremos q la tragedia AMIA sea utilizada como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero de intereses geopolíticos ajenos...” (Mensajes de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 de horas: 10:26 a 10:32). Con estas palabras, pretendió instalar mediáticamente la noticia desde el entusiasmo de una “victoria histórica”, manteniendo oculto el plan de encubrimiento orquestado para viabilizar políticamente un acercamiento geopolítico e intercambio comerciales de Estado a Estado con Irán. Continuó cumpliendo su rol en el plan criminal al negar las especulaciones que circularon apenas se conoció el acuerdo, que acusaban a las autoridades del gobierno nacional de haber actuado en virtud de intereses comerciales. La Sra. Presidente dijo en su mensaje de elevación del anteproyecto de ley de aprobación del memorando al Congreso Nacional que: “...Se quiere presentar el acuerdo como una especie de argucia para “iniciar ” el comercio con Irán. Lo cierto es que ese comercio existe desde 1990 y, salvo los años 2004 y 2005, ha sido superavitario...” (Mensaje Presidencial N°173 de elevación al Congreso Nacional del anteproyecto de ley sobre el Memorando de Entendimiento entre Argentina e Irán). Es cierto que el flujo entre privados de ambos países venía incrementándose, pero el verdadero interés radicaba en restablecer las relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado. Muchísimas son las comunicaciones telefónicas registradas que dan cuenta de ello en los niveles más altos del gobierno. Son cosas bien diferentes el comercio entre privados que los acuerdos entre Estados. Entonces, argumentar por una situación nunca responde por la otra. Por lo demás, cabe recordar las palabras de quien fuera Canciller de Néstor Kirchner, Rafael Bielsa, cuando afirmó que Cristina Fernández “...le dice a los familiares que los que comercian son las empresas y no el Estado. Me parece un argumento pelotudo, me fastidia mucho porque era un tema sagrado para Néstor...”, y agregó: “Cuando era canciller, hablar de venderle o comprarle a Irán era casus bellí\ (el resaltado es propio, Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013). En este engaño, Cristina Fernández fue secundada con énfasis por el Canciller Timerman, quien en varias oportunidades afirmó que el pacto no tuvo ninguna motivación económica y para demostrarlo, señaló: “Me ofende que Ud. invente lo de los intereses económicos....¡Cómo voy a hacer algo que está prohibido por las Naciones Unidas?...porque si Ud. supiera, hubiera leído las sanciones de las Naciones Unidas, y se daría cuenta que es imposible lo que Ud. está planteando, pero como Ud. no leyó las sanciones de las Naciones Unidas, simplemente repite lo que escucha por ahí....no puede haber intereses económicos ...porque hay sanciones económicas impuestas por las Naciones Unidas, de las cuales la Argentina es suscripta, que impiden el comercio con Irán más allá del que se está realizando , que es en granos, y eso no lo hace el gobierno argentino...lo hacen las empresas privadas ....yo les pedí que no lo hagan...” (Tenembaum, Ernesto, Tierra de Locos, entrevista a Héctor Timerman, 18/02/2013). En otra oportunidad, aseveró: “... ¿Por qué no puede vender el petróleo Irán? Por sanciones. Entonces, ¿cómo Argentina le va a comprar?...Hay sanciones. Hoy, no se puede comprar petróleo...” (Piqué, Martín. “Si se lleva adelante el memorándum, se activa la causa y comienza el juicio”, Tiempo Argentino, 17/02/2013). Lo cierto es que, a excepción de un conjunto de insumos relacionados con el plan nuclear iraní, no existe óbice legal que impida intercambios comerciales de Estado a Estado entre Argentina e Irán. Todas las resoluciones que el Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas ha dictado impidiendo a los países miembros a comerciar con la República Islámica de Irán se han referido artículos, materiales, equipos, bienes y tecnologías relacionadas con el enriquecimiento, reprocesamiento de minerales nucleares o agua pesada, o con el desarrollo de sistemas de vectores de armas nucleares13.Una nueva mentira del Sr. Timerman, que viene a engrosar la larga lista de engaños de los que debió valerse para intentar -con escaso éxito, por cierto- ocultar el delito del que fue partícipe. De hecho, el 16 de diciembre de 2010, en el marco de la 40a Cumbre del Mercosur celebrada en Foz de Iguazú, se anunció la suscripción de un convenio de libre comercio con Irán (Levinas, Gabriel, op. Cit., pag. 238). Esta circunstancia fue posteriormente desmentida por el canciller, quien explicó: “...Es falso, una mentira, una infamia que el Mercosur esté siquiera pensando hacer un Tratado de Libre Comercio con Irán...Lo que firmamos es un Acuerdo General de Preferencia, donde cualquier país que es miembro puede decir ""yo me anoto ”. Irán dijo ""yo me anoto ”, pero no 15	Resoluciones del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU N° 1385, 1686, 1737, 1747, 1803 y 1929 de no proliferación de annas nucleares. se anotó...” (“El fantasma de Irán y el reconocimiento a los palestinos se metió en el escenario político argentino”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 16/12/2010; “Timerman calificó como infamia la información sobre un acuerdo entre el Mercosur e Irán”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 16/12/2010). Además, y esto es fundamental, ante las consultas sobre la relación comercial con Irán, el Canciller Timerman explicó: “...Irán es parte del Grupo de los 77 al que adhiere Argentina y los 10 países que firmamos este acuerdo de preferencias arancelarias. Por lo tanto, no hay ninguna clase de restricciones...” para comerciar con Irán. (Gosman, Eleonora, “Mercosur: anuncian un acuerdo de libre comercio con Palestina”, Clarín, 16/12/2010; Levinas, Gabriel, op cit, pag. 238; Eliaschev, José “Pepe”, “Desinteligencias”, Perfil, 18/12/2010). Es decir, poco tiempo antes de la secreta cumbre de Alepo, el mismo Héctor Timerman ya había sostenido públicamente que no existían restricciones para comerciar con Irán, país con el cual hasta se podía establecer un trato preferencial en los intercambios. Incluso luego de la reunión de Alepo, en abril de 2011 y en ocasión de su visita a Israel, en una conferencia de prensa que brindó junto con su par israelí Avigdor Lieberman, Timerman afirmó: “...no existe ningún problema de comerciar con Irán. Argentina no tiene ningún embargo contra Irán. Irán no tiene ningún embargo contra Argentina...” (Levinas, Gabriel, op. cit. págs. 247/248, 269, 282; “Joint press conference with FM Lieberman and Argentine FM Timerman”, Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 04/04/2011). Luego de firmado el pacto, como surge de lo detallado párrafos más arriba, el Canciller no tuvo reparos en afirmar exactamente lo contrario de lo que venía diciendo. Otro ejemplo de este tipo de afirmaciones falaces por parte del Sr. Canciller tuvo lugar en ocasión del tratamiento parlamentario del acuerdo cuando, para justificar el pacto -y la “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en el mismo-, hizo afirmaciones completamente inexactas sobre las vicisitudes del trámite de extradición del ex embajador iraní en Argentina para la época del atentado, Hadi Soleimanpour, ante las autoridades del Reino Unido. En efecto, ante el plenario de comisiones en el Senado de la Nación, el 13 de febrero de 2013, el Ministro Timerman declaró: “...el pedido de extradición ordenado por la Argentina del ex embajador iraní Hadi Soleimanpour fue desechado por la justicia británica debido a la inexistencia de pruebas...que Interpol se negó a emitir una circular roja por considerar que ya había sido detenido y sobreseído y liberado por falta de pruebas...que las pruebas producidas por el entonces juez de la causa el doctor Galeano para solicitar la extradición del ex embajador iraní al momento del atentado fueron desechadas porque según las autoridades judiciales de un tercer país, en este caso el Reino Unido, no alcanzaban ni para iniciar el proceso de extradición...'’'’ (Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Asuntos Constitucionales y de Justicia y Asuntos Penales de la Cámara de Senadores desarrollado el 13 de febrero de 2013). En suma, Timerman afirmó que la “falta de pruebas”, que la “inexistencia de pruebas’’’’ había llevado a las “autoridades judiciales de un tercer país”, en concreto, a la “justicia británica’’’ a sobreseer y liberar al diplomático persa, y que eso -además- había derivado en que Interpol se niegue a emitir una nueva notificación roja respecto de este sujeto cuando, vuelto a ser imputado por el Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, se libró renovada orden de captura internacional en su contra. Pero, una vez más, los hechos estaban alejados de las palabras. En el año 2003, cuando la causa aún tramitaba ante el ex Juez Juan José Galeano, Soleimanpour fue detenido provisoriamente en el Reino Unido, con miras a su extradición, en virtud de una orden de captura que entonces se encontraba vigente. El diplomático iraní solicitó, y así se le otorgó, libertad bajo fianza, para esperar fuera de prisión el trámite de extradición. En esa oportunidad, el juez británico hizo algunas apreciaciones sobre la cuestión probatoria, pero aclaró que era prematuro pronunciarse sobre el tema, porque la justicia argentina tenía dos meses para solicitar formalmente la extradición y presentar las evidencias del caso. En otras palabras, se estaba transitando la etapa de arresto provisorio y todavía no se había iniciado propiamente el juicio de extradición. Y	aunque la justicia argentina cumplió con su parte, llegado el momento, fue el Subsecretario de Estado del Reino Unido quien decidió no dar curso al juicio de extradición de Soleimanpour, que no se pudo sustanciar, por razones de índole político no expresadas en la decisión y en virtud de una prerrogativa legal prevista en el tratado de extradición que rigió el caso. En suma, si no se pudo lograr la extradición de Soleimanpour en aquel momento fue por decisión política, y no judicial, y ésta no se motivó en la poca solidez probatoria de aquella acusación, como aviesamente se quiso hacer creer a la opinión pública, sino que fueron razones políticas no expresadas las que llevaron a esa decisión. Soleimanpour no fue nunca sobreseído por la justicia inglesa, como se dijo. Esto fue también advertido por la Cámara Federal y expuesto en el fallo que declaró inconstitucional al Memorando de Entendimiento con Irán, y a su ley aprobatoria (Voto del Dr. Eduardo G. Farah, CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 “AMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N°6- Secretaría N°11). Todas estas falacias argumentativas conforman la campaña de engaño, ingrediente importante del plan de impunidad. Así, la mendacidad y el doble discurso han sido la regla en este asunto. Todos los involucrados mienten deliberadamente y, para colmo, en cuestiones que son fácilmente comprobables. De allí se concluye que la gravedad de las acciones a ocultar - el encubrimiento en favor de extranjeros prófugos, del peor atentado terrorista de la historia argentina- eclipsa los medios para hacerlo. Dicho llanamente, es tan terrible lo que se debe ocultar que no se presta atención a los medios empleados en ese objetivo. Un cambio de declaración, una mentira, un engaño premeditado no tienen ni punto de comparación con la perspectiva de que se descubra el plan encubridor. b.	l) Manipulación de las víctimas v de los familiares de las víctimas del atentado. Además de falsear la realidad, mintiendo sobre el verdadero estado procesal de la causa AMIA, sobre el inicio de la negociación con Irán, sobre el contenido de las posteriores reuniones que fueron públicas y sobre el real sentido y alcance del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado; los autores de este encubrimiento no trepidaron en manipular vilmente tanto a las instituciones judías afectadas por el atentado como a los sobrevivientes y a los familiares de las víctimas que perecieron en la explosión. El objetivo de esta deleznable actitud era el mismo de siempre: ganar el apoyo de estos actores en particular y de la sociedad en general para implementar, sin que nadie sepa, el plan de impunidad. En efecto, apenas se tomó conocimiento de la suscripción del memorando con Irán, tanto las instituciones judías como las agrupaciones de víctimas y familiares de víctimas del atentado coincidieron en señalar que no habían sido previamente informados ni mucho menos consultados de que -efectivamente- se firmaría un acuerdo con Irán y, menos aún, de los contenidos del mismo (“El acuerdo con Irán sorprendió a los familiares de víctimas del ataque a la AMIA”, Infobae, 27/01/2013). En ese sentido, las autoridades de la AMIA hablaron de un “memorando inconsulto” y señalaron que: “la propuesta aparece firmada, un hecho del que no hemos sido informados”. Dijeron: “este memorando nos sorprende a toda la ciudadanía el pasado 27 de enero, jamás fue consultado, ni siquiera comentado” (Borger, Guillermo en: “La AMIA advirtió un momento difícil, tras el acuerdo entre Argentina e Irán”, La Nación, 3/2/2013; “Presidente de la AMIA prometió no bajar los brazos y se comprometió a evitar que la causa por el atentado causa en la nulidad”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 4/3/2013). Por su parte, los representantes de la DAIA afirmaron haber tomado conocimiento del acuerdo en el mismo momento que el resto de la opinión pública y aclararon que la institución no fue consultada previamente ni participó en la redacción del documento (Schlosser, Julio en: “LA DAIA reconoció que hay un resquemor en la comunidad judía por el acuerdo que la Argentina firmó con Irán”, Itongadol, 4/2/2013). De hecho, la novedad les llegó por la cuenta oficial de “twitter” de la Sra. Presidente e, inmediatamente, por los medios de comunicación masiva (Mensajes de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 de horas 10:26 a 10:32, transcriptos en párrafos previos; “Vía Twitter: La Presidenta sorprendió al anunciar un acuerdo con Irán por la AMIA”, El Cronista Comercial, 28/01/2013). Ello generó un inmediato resquemor, dado que la Sra. Presidente se había comprometido públicamente, en su discurso de septiembre de 2012 en Naciones Unidas, a consultar previamente cualquier propuesta formulada por Irán. Recuérdense sus palabras: “tengan la certeza de que esta Presidenta no va a tomar ninguna resolución respecto de ninguna propuesta que le sea formulada, sin consultar PREVIAMENTE con quienes han sido las víctimas directas de esto. Y, al mismo tiempo también, con las fuerzas políticas con representación parlamentaria en mi país, porque esto no lo puede decidir una sola fuerza política...'''’ (Discurso de Cristina Fernández ante la 67a Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, de fecha 25 de septiembre de 2012, el resaltado es propio). Esta promesa nunca fue cumplida y, en rigor de verdad, se trató de una manipulación de tantas que protagonizó la Sra. Cristina Fernández en su recorrido delictual. Asimismo quedó al descubierto la brutal diferencia con el modo en que en el pasado se había manejado esta cuestión con la dirigencia comunitaria y -principalmente- con los familiares y víctimas del atentado. Al respecto, Rafael Bielsa señaló: “Estábamos en permanente contacto con los familiares y la comunidad, informándolos de todo....Cada paso que dábamos, cada memorándum que enviábamos, lo consultábamos con todos, porque era una cuestión muy sensible y estaba siempre el fantasma de las ofertas...'’'’ (Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013). En ese contexto, quedó evidenciado que aquella incumplida promesa presidencial había tenido por objeto preservar el apoyo que, hasta entonces, tenía en gran medida la gestión de la Dra. Fernández en relación al caso AMIA, dentro de las entidades comunitarias y los grupos de familiares y víctimas del atentado. En la misma línea debe anotarse el tratamiento parlamentario por el que se aprobó el memorando. El citado trámite parlamentario nada tiene de “previo a toda resolución”, ni de “consulta sobre una propuesta”, sino que es el medio posterior para convalidar legislativamente una propuesta ya aceptada y firmada. Por otra parte, la aprobación del memorando tuvo lugar en el ámbito del Poder Legislativo, que no constituye el espacio de actuación, vinculación y/o consulta del Poder Ejecutivo con los familiares de las víctimas, aun cuando algunos de ellos hayan podido concurrir a las sesiones y/o hayan hablado en instancia de comisión. Además de todas estas obviedades que ratifican el incumplimiento de la promesa, no se le dio ninguna entidad a las opiniones adversas al acuerdo, cuando representantes de fuerzas políticas opositoras, las instituciones comunitarias y varios de los grupos que engloban a familiares y víctimas se pronunciaron en contra de la aprobación del acuerdo, expresando numerosas objeciones. Para sostener esta afirmación, basta recurrir a los dichos de varios de los familiares de las víctimas del atentado. Sofía Guterman declaró: “Nadie nos informó para decirnos que teníamos que anotarnos. Nadie nos dijo nada. Me sorprendió mucho...No pensé que iban a apurar tanto el trámite, pero evidentemente la carrera se terminaba y tenían que llegar a la meta propuesta...Me repugnó cuando Pichetto dijo 'apuremos que la presidenta dijo que se termine(Sofía Guterman, “Se está haciendo todo lo posible para que Irán salga triunfante de esto”, Radio JAI, 14/02/2013). Por su parte, Laura Ginsberg afirmó: “...Uno esperaría que el Congreso fuera un ámbito de reflexión, Timerman imprimió, como también  6	En alusión a Femando Esteche. 7	En alusión al Ministro Julio De Vido.   Ministerio Público de la Nación lo senadores del oficialismo, las características de un ambiente pobre, chicanero y vulgar...” y en alusión al debate, señaló: “...estuvo en manos de Timerman y del gobierno, porque la intención de ellos era apurar rapidito la ley...”. Finalmente, sentenció: “...Lo único que el gobierno quiere es sancionar lo antes posible esta ley, que significa un punto final para el tema de la AMIA...” y resumió: “...Lo de ayer fue miserable...” (Laura Ginsberg, “Sobre el cruce en el debate por el memorándum: Lo de ayer fue miserable”, La Razón, 14/02/2013). Finalmente, un grupo de familiares que reúne a Luis Czyzewski y Mario Averbuch, entre otros, denunció no haber podido expresar su opinión en el plenario de comisiones realizado en el Honorable Senado de la Nación (“Familiares de las víctimas del atentado a la AMIA piden participar en el plenario de Diputados”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 22/02/2013). Además, no se consultó previamente a nadie. Las víctimas y sus familiares se enteraron por los medios de la firma del acuerdo y de su contenido. No tuvieron ningún tipo de participación durante todo el proceso de negociación que, como ya se comprobó, fue secreto. En palabras de la dirigencia comunitaria judía: “...No hemos recibido ni siquiera una llamada telefónica anticipando esta posibilidad. Nos hemos sorprendido, pleno domingo, Día Internacional del Holocausto, plenas vacaciones, plena feria judicial. Nos enteramos por los medios... Concretamente fuimos absolutamente sorprendidos por este memorándum...” (Borger, Guillermo. Versión taquigráfica del plenario de comisiones del 13 de febrero de 2013). Queda claro que dijeran lo que dijeran los familiares y víctimas del atentado, la decisión estaba tomada. El memorando había sido firmado sin consulta previa y debía ser aprobado a cualquier costo. Ello era estrictamente necesario para la consecución del plan criminal pergeñado. A ello debe agregarse que la mentira presidencial sobre las consultas previas fue acompañada por una rotunda denegación de información a los familiares de las víctimas del atentado, pese a que la enviada, como anexo, formando parte integrante del Memorándum de Entendimiento que se someterá a la aprobación...” parlamentaria (“AMIA informa a la opinión pública sobre las conclusiones de la reunión mantenida con el canciller Timerman en el día de ayer”, Prensa Judía, 30/01/2013; “La AMIA pide que las promesas de Timerman sean anexadas por escrito al acuerdo original”, Clarín, 30 de enero de 2013). Por su parte, la agrupación “Memoria Activa” también emitió un comunicado que rezaba: “...Memoria Activa concurrió el martes 29/1 a una reunión convocada por el canciller Héctor Timerman en la sede de la AMIA. En la misma el canciller aclaró los términos del acuerdo en relación a los siguientes puntos, que pasan a ser las bases innegociables del mismo y que serán ratificadas por el gobierno argentino por escrito: 1-Los imputados serán indagados en Teherán bajo el código penal procesal de la República Argentina por el juez y el fiscal de la causa AMIA. 2- Las alertas rojas y pedidos de captura de Interpol de los imputados se mantendrán vigentes...” (Comunicado de Memoria Activa a la opinión pública, del 31 de enero de 2013). En declaraciones a la prensa, Adriana Reisfeld de “Memoria Activa”, agregó: “Se habló de estoy Timerman dijo que así iba a ser. Se comprometió a estos puntos” (Cappiello, Hernán, “Timerman se molestó con la AMIA por sus exigencias”, La Nación, 1/2/2013). Y	las comunidades judías de todo el país expresaron -entre sus preocupaciones y demandas relativas al memorando- que ""en ninguna instancia de este proceso habrá riesgo de que pierdan vigencia las circulares rojas emitidas por Interpol"" (“La AMIA pide al gobierno que rehaga el memorándum con Irán”, La Nación, 1 /2/2013). Sin embargo, el Canciller negó haberse comprometido con víctimas, familiares y dirigentes comunitarios a tramitar un anexo al acuerdo (“La AMIA pide al gobierno que rehaga el memorándum con Irán”, La Nación, 1/2/2013; Cappiello, Hernán, “Timerman se molestó con la AMIA por sus exigencias”, La Nación, 1/2/2013). Ahora bien, en ambos casos, tanto la promesa presidencial de consultar a los familiares, víctimas y fuerzas políticas con representación parlamentaria, ANTES de avanzar en un acuerdo con Irán, como el compromiso inmediatamente desmentido por el canciller en relación a la confección de un anexo al memorando, son ejemplos públicos y evidentes de las maniobras de manipulación realizadas por funcionarios públicos involucrados en el encubrimiento aquí denunciado, destinadas esencialmente a construir respaldo para el acuerdo con Irán. Las acciones de la Presidente y el Canciller descriptas en este punto constituyen ardides que deliberadamente buscan engañar. Todo con un único y delictivo propósito: lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados y el cese de toda actividad jurisdiccional en su contra, para viabilizar el objetivo mediato: comerciar libremente a nivel estatal y asociarse geopolíticamente con la República Islámica de Irán sin soportar reproche alguno por parte de la sociedad argentina. Resumiendo, para llevar a buen puerto el acuerdo con Irán y lograr la impunidad de los acusados, se tuvo que incumplir la promesa de una consulta previa a cualquier acuerdo y el compromiso asumido para negociar un anexo al convenio. Se hizo creer que se buscaría el consenso de todo el arco político para avanzar en un pacto, pero -en los hechos- se desoyeron las múltiples y extendidas opiniones contrarias al memorando. Y como se verá en el acápite siguiente, se articularon puestas en escena para mostrar falsos avances diplomáticos ante la sociedad argentina. b.	2) Puestas en escena. Luego del discurso presidencial con motivo de la apertura del período de sesiones de la 68°Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, la Dra. Fernández reclamó fuertemente a las autoridades iraníes que respondan a las solicitudes argentinas en relación al pacto firmado varios meses atrás, (cfr. Discurso de Cristina Fernández, 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2013). Ningún representante iraní estuvo presente en la sala para escuchar a la Dra. Fernández y, a diferencia de ella, el Presidente Hassan Rohani ni mencionó el tema en su discurso. Claros indicios, a esa altura de los acontecimientos, del exiguo interés de Teherán en el acuerdo firmado con nuestro país, una vez cerrada la posibilidad del cese de las notificaciones rojas. Por lo pronto los reclamos mencionados en el parágrafo que antecede fueron realizados la noche del día martes 24 de septiembre de 2013. Según dijo Timerman, dos días después, el jueves 26, la diplomacia argentina recibió un llamado del canciller iraní para concertar un encuentro el sábado 28 (Miri, Ignacio, “Timerman dijo que Irán aprobó el pacto por la AMIA, pero aún no rige”, Clarín, 29/09/2013; “Timerman se reunirá con su par de Irán en la ONU”, Prensa Argentina, 26/09/2013). “Acabo de recibir un llamado del canciller Javad Zarif para reunimos el sábado por el tema AMIA”, anunció Timerman en diálogo con periodistas en Nueva York (“Argentina e Irán reactivan el diálogo para avanzar en la causa”, La Capital, 27/09/2013). Otros medios transcribieron las siguientes palabras del canciller: “Hace unos minutos hemos recibido una llamada de las autoridades de la República Islámica de Irán solicitando tener una reunión en el marco de las Naciones Unidas entre los dos cancilleres para tratar el tema del memorándum...” (Cibeira, Femando “Cara a cara para dialogar sobre el memorándum”, Página 12, 27/2013). Además, el Canciller declaró que el objetivo del encuentro era: “...conocer el estado actual del memorándum de acuerdo a la legislación iraní, es decir, si fue aprobado por el Congreso o no. Si fue aprobado por el Congreso, entonces, establecer el marco con el cual vamos a formal izar¬la fecha de conformación de la Comisión y al mismo tiempo el viaje de las autoridades judiciales a Teherán...Y si no fue aprobado, cuándo se aprobará...” (“Timerman se reunirá con su par de Irán en la ONU”, Prensa Argentina, 26/09/2013; Cibeira, Femando “Cara a cara para dialogar sobre el memorándum”, Página 12, 27/9/2013). Así, se transmitía a la ciudadanía la inquietud y expectativa por saber qué dirían los iraníes luego del público y fuerte reclamo de la Sra. Presidente. De su discurso se desprendía que Irán debía confirmar si el acuerdo estaba aprobado, cuándo se conformaría la “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en su letra y cuándo viajarían las autoridades judiciales argentinas a las audiencias de Teherán. Mientras tanto, una diplomacia paralela conformada por canales de negociación y comunicación alternativos entre ambos gobiernos, actuaba para que la realidad se acomode a los intereses de los encubridores. Por orden de Cristina Fernández y Héctor Timerman, el viernes 27 de septiembre de 2013, un día antes del encuentro con la contraparte iraní, Luis D'Elía llamó a Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, manifestando: “...tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar para allá urgente, antes de mañana...Estoy en la Casa de Gobierno ahora...Vayamos a la Embajada...no hay asunto más importante que éste, créemelo...” (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-103753-14, CD 161). Presidencia de la Nación quería comunicarse con Teherán con suma urgencia, un día antes del encuentro de cancilleres y a través de los canales no oficiales. El mensaje no fue transmitido por el Palacio San Martín a la cancillería iraní. No se comunicó Héctor Timerman con Mohammad Javad Zarif Khonsari. No podía hacerse de esa manera. Sino que el mensaje salió del despacho presidencial de la Dra. Fernández, llegó a Luis D'Elía, a Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, al Encargado de Negocios Iraní en Buenos Aires, y de allí a Teherán. Secreto. Oculto. Completamente inaudito. Propio del plan criminal llevado adelante. En efecto, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil llamó a la Embajada de Irán y avisó que necesitaba ver al Encargado de Negocios en forma urgente: “...yo necesito sacarlo quince minutos, necesito darle un mensaje...es urgente, urgente...es del gobierno argentino, mandaron un mensaje para él ...llamaron recién de Casa de Gobierno...'''’ (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-104209-26, CD 161). Además, Luis D'Elía urgió la presencia de Khalil dado que, además, quería que diera “aviso a otro lado”, así, agregaría: “necesito que hables con el sheik allá”, en referencia a Mohsen Rabbani, aclarando en otro llamado: “...mirá que es muy groso lo que tengo, eh!...me lo pidió...” (Comunicaciones del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-09-27-114113-28, CD 161; Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-104245- 8.txt, CD 161). Una vez más el imputado Mohsen Rabbani era avisado al instante de los mensajes de Cristina Fernández. El Encargado de Negocios de Irán le transmitió a Khalil que no quería que esté presente en la reunión con “la gente del gobierno”, dado que quería ver a Khalil en privado (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-104852-14.wav, CD 161). Khalil reportó que había coordinado, entonces, para que el diplomático iraní recibiera a D'Elía: “...yo le hablé al embajador'6 y no hay problema, lo recibe...”, por Luis D'Elía (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-110437-18, CD 161). La cadena de “intermediarios” se activó a pedido de la Dra. Fernández. ¿El motivo? Khalil lo explicó así: “...Necesita que el gobierno iraní junto con el gobierno argentino mañana anuncie la conformación de la “Comisión de la Verdad”...que por favor lo anuncien en conjunto mañana en la reunión...que se defina el día de la reunión de la “Comisión de la Verdad” y también que se defina el día, en el mes de enero, en que el juez argentino pueda viajar a Teherán...” (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161). Como resaltó D'Elía:	“...que	mañana lo anuncien los dos...” (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-114113-28, CD 161). Estas conversaciones demuestran tres cuestiones. Primero y una vez más, el interés imperioso de los encubridores en avanzar con el plan. El tema no figuraba en la agenda de Irán en Nueva York: “...la reunión se hace de apuro a pedido de Cristina...” y “ ...fíjate que Rohani ni habló del tema AMIA en su discurso...” (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11-3238-4966, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161).   Ministerio Público de la Nación Algunos de los contactos que participaron de estas tratativas entendieron, un día antes de la cumbre de cancilleres y sin conocer aún la respuesta de Teherán, que las autoridades iraníes no iban a conceder lo que secretamente solicitaba la Presidente Fernández y, además, que la actitud pública de Argentina de “apurar” a los iraníes era pour la galerie o “para la galería” (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11-3238-4966, Archivo B-1009- 2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161). Segundo, quedó en exposición que hay cosas que se conversan y arreglan de antemano sin comunicar a la opinión pública, a la que se busca engañar con puesta en escenas, falsas negociaciones, acuerdos ocultos, etc. Se entiende que se maneje con reserva un tema delicado. Pero la reserva, en este caso, es únicamente para engañar y para ocultar actividades ilícitas. Es para aparentar y no ser descubiertos. Tercero, estas pruebas ponen en evidencia que, por detrás, sin que nadie lo sepa, estaba todo arreglado y, en realidad, no existía ningún secreto ni expectativa, porque las autoridades argentinas sabían lo que ocurriría en la cumbre. “Pour la galerie” se haría aquello que terminaron acordando con Teherán previamente, aunque no fuera exactamente lo que se había pedido desde el despacho presidencial de la Casa Rosada, como surge de las comunicaciones aquí transcriptas. A través del canal paralelo por el que también se ejecutó este encubrimiento, Luis D'Elía llamó a su amigo Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, referente orgánico de Irán en el país, para transmitirle un mensaje que debía llevar a Teherán, sobre lo que la Presidente necesitaba que los iraníes anuncien en el encuentro, para engañar a la ciudadanía respecto del estado de situación real. La reunión del sábado 28 de septiembre de 2013, entre Timerman y el flamante Canciller iraní Mohammad Javad Zarif Khonsari, en la sede de Naciones Unidas en Nueva York, fue una mise en scene, es decir, una puesta en escena para que la gente crea verdaderamente que estaban negociando algo y/o que la diplomacia argentina estaba obteniendo resultados en función de la reciente demanda pública de la mandataria. Como ya se indicó, lo cierto es que las autoridades argentinas habían pedido -por canales no oficiales- un anuncio conjunto de ambos cancilleres y definiciones sobre varios temas, algo, aparentemente, demasiado ambicioso. Pero los iraníes, en lo que pudo ser “...un gesto...hacia el gobierno argentino en vísperas de elecciones...” (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-09-27-135214-22, CD 161), aceptaron meramente que se anuncie pública, aunque no conjuntamente, que Irán había aprobado el memorando con el aval del Consejo Superior de Seguridad Nacional y del Líder Supremo, aunque esto no fuera cierto. Nuevamente “pour la galerie”. Aquel sábado 28 los cancilleres tuvieron dos reuniones, con consultas intermedias a sus mandatarios. No se intercambiaron las notas reversales. El tratado no entró en vigor. No se definió ningún plazo respecto de la “Comisión de la Verdad” ni sobre las audiencias de Teherán. No hubo ningún anuncio conjunto. Ninguna autoridad iraní declaró nada oficialmente. Luego de las reuniones, el Canciller Timerman dialogó con la prensa y explicó que su par le había asegurado que el memorando estaba aprobado internamente por el Consejo Nacional de Defensa, con el Presidente de Irán a la cabeza y el aval del Líder Supremo. Y que equipos técnicos se reunirían en Suiza en la primera quincena de noviembre para ir viendo la implementación del acuerdo (Miri, Ignacio, “Timerman dijo que Irán aprobó el pacto por la AMIA, pero aún no rige”, Clarín, 29/09/2013; Pisani, Silvia, “Irán le confirmó a Timerman que ya aprobó el acuerdo”, La Nación, 29/09/2013 “Timerman anunció nueva reunión con Irán en noviembre”, Prensa Argentina, 28/09/2013; “Timerman ratificó la aprobación del memorándum de entendimiento con Irán y un nuevo encuentro”, Télam, 28/09/2013; “Irán aprobó el memorándum de entendimiento por la AMIA”, Página 12, 28/09/2013). IRNA, la agencia oficial de noticias de la República Islámica informó sobre el encuentro de ambos cancilleres, pero nada dijo sobre la aprobación del memorándum, sino que se limitó a comunicar que se había 16	Así denominan al Encargado de Negocios apostado en Buenos Aires, por ser -actualmente- la persona de mayor jerarquía dentro de la Embajada.     convenido una nueva reunión para noviembre en Ginebra, Suiza. (IRNA, “Zarif continúes talks with counterparts in New York”, 29/09/2013). Es decir, Irán aceptó reunirse y no desmentir las declaraciones de Timerman pero no fue más allá. De hecho, en Irán, la pretendida aprobación del acuerdo fue meramente informada por el “Tehran Times” que tomó como única fuente de esta novedad a la agencia de noticias oficial argentina TÉLAM. Inédito. El diario persa “Tehran Times”, uno de los más importantes de la nación iraní, en su tarea de informar sobre una decisión adoptada por el gobierno de su país refirió como fuente a la agencia oficial de noticias de otro país, Argentina (“Argentina says Irán committed to probing 1994 bombing”, Tehran Times, 29/09/2013; “Timerman ratificó la aprobación del memorándum de entendimiento con Irán y un nuevo encuentro”, Télam, 28/09/2013) ¿Cómo puede ser que la fuente no sea iraní? ¿Cómo puede ser que para un acto de gobierno decidido y producido en Teherán la fuente del “Tehran Times” sea TÉLAM? En este episodio, como en otros, la actuación del canciller había sido maquillaje mediático, pues todo se sabía de antes. Todo se preparó, se negoció y tergiversó antes. En secreto. Por los canales paralelos y paraoficiales que, como se demostrará a continuación, han sido muy importantes en la consecución del encubrimiento aquí denunciado. Mientras la República Argentina estaba pendiente del resultado de la reunión del Canciller en Nueva York, en la Casa Rosada ya sabían qué ocurriría y que todo era una puesta en escena. Ello no importaba, lo relevante fue lo que se transmitió luego a la opinión pública y, obviamente, el engaño. Ahora bien, todos los elementos descriptos en este acápite deben ser interpretados de forma integral y en función de una cuestión central: los encubridores necesitaron contar siempre con el mayor apoyo posible por parte de la opinión pública para facilitar la implementación de su plan criminal. Dadas las especiales características del encubrimiento aquí denunciado y el rol institucional de muchos de sus autores y partícipes, el peso de la opinión pública en el respaldo al Memorando de Entendimiento y la necesidad de que la misma permanezca ajena a los verdaderos objetivos perseguidos mediante el citado instrumento, han signado acciones y reacciones públicas de los involucrados. En suma, viene al caso enumerar las falsedades y demás maniobras ardidosas en que han incurrido la Sra. Presidente y su Canciller para ocultar su plan criminal: 1) la causa está paralizada, 2) no se permitirá que el caso AMIA se transforme en una pieza de ajedrez de la geopolítica mundial, 3) con la aplicación del Memorando de Entendimiento no hay nada que perder, 4) el acuerdo no contiene cláusulas secretas, 5) el instrumento permite recibirle declaración indagatoria a los imputados iraníes, 6) no hay ningún interés comercial detrás de este acuerdo, 7) no se puede comerciar con Irán porque está prohibido por la ONU, 8) se consultará a los familiares y víctimas previo a tomar cualquier decisión sobre las propuestas iraníes, 9) se firmará un anexo al Memorando de Entendimiento que asegure la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas, 10) la negociación con Irán se inició a instancias de Teherán, 11) el proceso de negociación comenzó en septiembre de 2012. c)	Otros caminos para favorecer el plan de impunidad La campaña para motorizar el encubrimiento no fue solamente mediática, se han obtenido evidencias que exponen las intenciones de los partícipes de este encubrimiento de remover al suscripto de su cargo al frente de la Unidad Fiscal que investiga el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, como una forma más de allanar el camino para el cumplimiento de sus objetivos criminales. Una de las vías elegidas para este caso fue utilizar la falsa hipótesis armada desde cierto sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia para culpar por el atentado a nuevos autores inventados como el mecanismo para desacreditar la labor del suscripto. Es decir, si se lograba imponer esta falsa teoría como la verdadera, ello implicaba, por añadidura, que la labor de la Unidad Fiscal había sido errada o peor aún, malintencionada. En consecuencia, podría sostenerse con mayor facilidad un intento de remoción de quien firma esta presentación. Justamente, las pruebas han revelado que: “...va a venir otra hipótesis con otras pruebas”. Y en ese escenario, se dijo que el suscripto va a quedar totalmente descolocado por la nueva hipótesis fundada en pruebas falsas que, obviamente, no estaban agregadas a la causa. Se dijo: “...va a hacer culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas ...lo que viene ahora... es una prueba contundente...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Efectivamente, se sabía que para deslegitimar al abajo firmante y a la investigación llevada a cabo conforme a derecho, para avanzar con el encubrimiento de los acusados iraníes, necesitaban inventar una nueva -y falsa- hipótesis, con “pruebas” nunca vistas, nunca presentadas en la causa. De estas expresiones de “Alian” se desprende que para quienes se encuentran detrás de este encubrimiento, un objetivo clave ha sido remover al suscripto, mediante el descrédito personal y/o la deslegitimación de la pesquisa, a partir de -como surge de sus planes- hipótesis inventadas con pruebas falsas. Existen otros indicios que dan cuenta del interés de remover a este denunciante. Como se dijo, el descrédito de la investigación resulta un paso necesario para el plan, cuya ejecución se vería enormemente facilitada -sin lugar a dudas- por la ausencia de quien tiene a su cargo la investigación de este acto de terrorismo internacional. Khalil sabía porque “Alian”, su contacto en la Secretaría de Inteligencia, con acceso al entorno presidencial, le había dicho que planeaban crear “otra hipótesis con otras pruebas'’’’ y así, descolocarían al abajo firmante (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Entonces, con motivo de la pronunciamiento emitido desde la Unidad Fiscal “AMIA” el 29 de mayo de 2013 que, justamente, profundiza la prueba y brinda nuevos elementos sobre la participación de funcionarios iraníes en el atentado, Khalil aseveró: “...son los últimos manotazos de ahogado que puede tirar este chabón...’’’' (Conversación del 1/06/2013, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo 61.30373.20130601.225511, CD 86). El 16 de julio de 2013, a dos días del aniversario del atentado, quien suscribe expuso en la sede del Hotel Intercontinental de la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, ante un amplio auditorio que incluyó legisladores nacionales y porteños, periodistas y expertos en derecho internacional, en el marco de una jornada organizada por el Congreso Judío Latinoamericano . En referencia a esa exposición Jorge Khalil, quien conversaba con Alejandro José Salomón, dijo: “...estoy escuchando a Nisman... ¡cómo nos mató un poquito!...si, si, nos mató bien, eh...para variar, si, si, para variar nos mató bien...”, y Salomón le respondió: “...bueno, cada vez es menos creíble y marcha la intervención de ese muchacho...” (Comunicación del 17/07/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-17-134828-28, CD 89). Estas palabras se corresponden con ciertos trascendidos de aquellas fechas que referían la posibilidad de intervención de esta Unidad Fiscal (“Estudian intervenir la fiscalía del caso AMIA”, Perfil, 14/07/2013). Claramente subyace el objetivo de alejar al suscripto del cargo que viene ejerciendo y, consecuentemente, de la causa AMIA, lo que se condice con las expresiones referidas en el párrafo previo. Ello beneficiaría sin duda al plan encubridor que aquí se detalla y se denuncia. De los hechos enumerados en este apartado queda evidenciado que se lanzó una feroz campaña de descrédito hacia la investigación del caso, destinada a horadar la versión judicial de los hechos, y se la combinó con una campaña de engaño compuesta por falacias, puestas en escena, mentiras, desmentidas y falsas promesas, se manipuló a víctimas y familiares del atentado, su buscó separar al suscripto de su cargo al frente de la Unidad Fiscal que investiga el atentado, a fin de evitar que la opinión   ALBERTO Ministerio Público de la Nación	F|SCAL GEN£RAL pública conozca la entidad del verdadero objetivo encubridor que subyace al pacto con Irán. d)	Gestos y otros favores: ingredientes para facilitar el plan de impunidad. Los autores de este encubrimiento siempre tuvieron claro que una parte importante del mismo consistía en contar con la buena predisposición de las autoridades del régimen iraní y de sus referentes locales, dado que la aquiescencia, o mejor aún, el respaldo de estos actores, contribuiría a facilitar el avance del plan criminal, por las peculiares características del mismo. Naturalmente, la cuestión relativa al cese de las notificaciones rojas, como ya se demostró, era un interés crucial para Teherán y generó fricciones entre encubridores y encubiertos. Por otra parte, el establecimiento de canales de comunicación y negociación paralelos a los oficiales, también resultó un recurso central para favorecer el acercamiento y el buen entendimiento con Teherán, en pos del avance del plan delictivo. No obstante ello, las acciones destinadas a conseguir la buena predisposición de los iraníes, y así facilitar el tránsito del plan criminal, no estuvieron limitadas a estos dos puntos, sino que se ha podido constatar la concesión de una serie de favores concretos, como por ejemplo: facilitación de gestiones, promesas de puestos de trabajo y acceso a contactos importantes; todos ellos procurados a los referentes locales del régimen, como gestos de buena voluntad y cercanía, destinados a favorecer -en última instancia- el plan de impunidad. Estos “favores” fundamentalmente demuestran el interés de la Sra. Presidente en mantener en buenos términos su relación con los contactos iraníes, para poder avanzar con su plan delictivo. Y en esa línea deben ser interpretados. El 28 de mayo de 2013, Adalberto Assad tuvo una reunión en el Ministerio de Justicia, que inmediatamente reportó a su referente Jorge “Yussuf” Khalil: “...recién salí hace un rato del Ministerio de Justicia...tengo unas novedades lindas ...necesito verte...necesito tener una charlaen el marco de una serie de visitas protocolares que distintos representantes que responden a Irán tuvieron en organismos oficiales, entre los que se encuentra el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores (Comunicación del 28/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28- 141635-26.txt, CD 39). Este acercamiento y la novedad de contar con “puertas abiertas” en los despachos más importantes del país llegó inmediatamente a conocimiento del prófugo Mohsen Rabbani, quien -como ya fue probado- ha participado activamente de las negociaciones con sus encubridores. En esa ocasión, Assad le reportó a Rabbani sobre su reunión con un ministro nacional: “...muchas cosas lindas que estamos viendo...reunidos con el Ministro, me sorprendió hoy, porque una apertura muy importante hacia la colectividad...esto es política, sheik...Estamos trabajando para...el gobierno, ahora estamos trabajando porque el Ministro va a hablar con la Presidente, me dijo hoy, para que me reciba...tengo ganas de verla a la Presidenta...”. Rabbani entendía que: “...nosotros...habíamos conversado con Argentina...Irán fue el primer comprador de Argentina y ahora no compra casi nada...pero...puede cambiar esta situación con ustedes y con el gobierno”, en alusión a los actuales referentes de Irán en Argentina, como Khalil, y las autoridades del presente gobierno argentino (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). De hecho, días antes de esta reunión en la cartera de justicia, el imputado Rabbani había recibido el mensaje enviado por Cristina Fernández, a través del Ministro De Vido y de los intermediarios Luis D'Elía y Jorge Khalil, que expresaba el interés por obtener petróleo (Comunicaciones del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-111124-8, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-122551-14, CD 31; Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-132253-6, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-133130-8, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-143508-24, CD 31).   Ministerio Público de la Nación Motorizado por la ciega necesidad de las autoridades argentinas involucradas en este plan de avanzar con la maniobra encubridora, los referentes locales del régimen iraní comenzaron a tener acceso a los despachos de distintos funcionarios de la gestión de Cristina Fernández. A través del agente identificado como “Alian”, cercano a la Sra. Presidente, los representantes de Teherán en Argentina han podido acceder a favores y a un trato preferencial en las más variadas gestiones. De ese modo, han utilizado los resortes y se han valido de sus flamantes contactos con el poder político local. Por ejemplo: “Alian” le prometió a Khalil cargos en la Dirección Nacional de Aduanas y en el Ministerio de Interior y Transporte para gente de la comunidad chiita, “...tiene que haber cambios en transporte y aduana y ahí van a tratar de meter ...diez tipos en cada lado” (Comunicaciones del 4/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-07-04-112603-6.txt, CD 76 y del 7/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-07-152130-22, CD 79). También Khalil le ha pedido favores para sus contactos en la Aduana (Comunicación del 24/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-24-175330- 20.txt, CD 35). En una oportunidad, Femando Esteche le aconsejó a Khalil que para que el “blanqueo” con la comunidad iraní local tenga mayor visibilidad pública, exija algunos gestos del gobierno, como por ejemplo “...que los inviten o que los empiecen a invitar a los actos de la Casa Rosada como exponentes de la comunidad...” o “.. .que la Presidente un día vaya para el Ramadán, para un desayuno...”, y agregó: “...que la Presidenta vaya...eso es más fácil para “Alian ”...” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Pretendían darle mayor publicidad al acercamiento. En otra ocasión, ante inconvenientes impositivos con la AFIP, miembros de la comunidad recurrieron a Jorge Khalil quien, a través de Luis D’Elía, garantizó el contacto directo con el Administrador Federal de Ingresos Públicos, Ricardo Echegaray, para resolver el problema (Comunicación del 21/11/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-11-21-210631-26, CD 216). Y	se obtuvo similar resultado, esto es, contactar a Ricardo Echegaray, a través de la gestión de “Alian” quien, ante un pedido de Khalil le expresó: “...no hay problema...te venís conmigo...” (Comunicación del 13/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-06-13-213124- 24, CD 55). Cabe señalar que estos “favores” encontraron, en más de una ocasión, el correlato buscado, es decir, se tradujeron en el avenimiento de los referentes locales del régimen, como Jorge Khalil, que en más de una ocasión expresaron su apoyo al gobierno argentino y actuaron de forma tal de fortalecer los vínculos entre Teherán y Buenos Aires, contribuyendo al avance del plan encubridor. En esa línea deben entenderse expresiones como: “...tenemos que dar combate acá, le digo, con la gente del gobierno, para apoyar al gobierno...'1'’ (Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-02-14-164341-10, CD 284). Y	también en esa misma línea debe interpretarse, por ejemplo, el episodio que tuvo lugar en noviembre de 2012, antes de firmarse el acuerdo, cuando Luis D’Elía y Andrés Larroque le solicitaron a Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil que no se sume a una marcha organizada por partidos de izquierda en defensa de la “causa palestina” porque ese tipo de acciones podían repercutir en las nuevas relaciones bilaterales. Khalil accedió al pedido y explicó los motivos de su allanamiento: “...Me imagino que los troskos van a empezar con mensajes en contra del gobierno, cosa que yo no quiero...no queremos hacer algo que irrite...no queremos irritar al gobierno argentino...no voy a hacer nada para irritar al gobierno argentino ...estamos arreglando un problema mayor para nosotros... ”, en evidente alusión a las imputaciones de los iraníes por el atentado contra la AMIA (Comunicación del 16/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2012-11-16-225815-2, CD 194). Sobre el mismo tema, explicó: “...Hoy a la mañana tuve una reunión con la gente del gobierno, me pidieron que por favor no vaya a la reunión...” y le dijeron: “ ...pará la bronca porque el tema de...puede repercutir en las relaciones que están manteniendo, las conversaciones que estamos teniendo nosotros en Ginebraen clara alusión a las rondas diplomáticas que desembocarían en la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-17-183444-8, CD 195). Finalmente, sobre el mismo episodio, relató Khalil: “...estamos en plenas negociaciones con el gobierno...en base a las negociaciones que se están haciendo entre Irán y Argentina, no queremos vernos inmiscuidos nosotros. Aparte fue un pedido del gobierno. Yo estuve hablando con D'Elía y con el Cuervo Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmití al Safir...y el Safir me dijo lo mismo... 'no hagamos algo que, que pueda molestar'....” (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18-095153-16, CD 196). Ahora bien, estos pedidos y favores por parte de los referentes locales de Teherán hubieran sido impensados de no haber existido el ostensible giro político y posterior acercamiento por parte de las autoridades argentinas, como ya fue probado en la presente. De hecho, también se obtuvieron numerosas piezas probatorias que dan cuenta -justamente- de este nuevo posicionamiento político del “gobierno argentino”. Nuevamente, vale aclarar que aquí no se analizan ni valoran decisiones políticas. El valor que se le reconoce a las manifestaciones que a continuación se transcribirán radica en que revelan, una vez más, que la realidad distaba bastante de lo que se comunicaba públicamente. Mientras a los argentinos nos decían que se había logrado doblegar, de cierta manera, la histórica renuencia iraní a colaborar con la causa judicial y que Teherán se allanaba -de algún modo- a los requerimientos argentinos; lo cierto es que el mensaje recibido en Teherán era otro: la Dra. Fernández había decidido garantizar la impunidad de los iraníes acusados por el atentado terrorista, como prolegómeno al comercio por petróleo persa. Y estaba dispuesta a congraciarse con el régimen. Ese fue el mensaje recibido en Teherán, y así lo expresaron sus referentes: “...porque el gobierno ahora está a favor...” de Irán (Comunicación del 6/6/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-06-092046-14, CD 48); “...el gobierno banca...'''1 (Comunicación del 30/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-30- 225622-30,	CD41);	“ ...estamos bien. Salieron a defendernos, directamente...”, se dijo en oportunidad del debate de aprobación parlamentaria del acuerdo con Irán (Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341 -10, CD 284). El mismo día en que se firmó el acuerdo con Irán, Jorge Khalil celebraba “...este acuerdo...esta nueva relación...esta nueva etapa...”, en clara referencia a este nuevo contexto de acercamiento con el gobierno argentino (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2013-01-27-112032-4, CD 266). Unos días después, Khalil destacó nuevamente este sustancial cambio de postura: “...fijáte con quién se está arreglando el gobierno ”, en alusión al acercamiento entre Irán y Argentina (Comunicación del 3/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-03-141619-26, CD 273). En julio de ese mismo año continuaban las expresiones de júbilo por la nueva postura en relación a Irán. Khalil, el día del último aniversario del atentado contra la AMIA dijo: “ ...nosotros estamos ...ante un acuerdo con el gobierno nacional ...atrás de una negociación con el gobierno nacional...”, y de toda la conversación surge a las claras que no se está refiriendo únicamente al memorando de entendimiento, sino a un arreglo subyacente y mucho más amplio (Comunicación del 18/07/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-18-155916-12, CD 90). 18 • En el acto del Día de Al Quds , Abdul Karim Paz dijo, en torno a la causa AMIA y en referencia al Memorando de Entendimiento firmado con Irán, que: “...la Argentina ha entendido cómo son las cosas, quiere dar vuelta la página e independizarse de lo que dicen los Estados Unidos e Israel...” (Dinatale, Martín, “D'Elía y Esteche reivindicaron a la agrupación terrorista Hezbollah”, La Nación, 13/08/2013). Más recientemente, en febrero de 2014, Khalil le seguía informando a Rabbani: “...estamos trabajando bien en lo político acá...” (Comunciación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014- 02-04-093431-30, CD 291). Los referentes locales de la República Islámica habían interpretado las acciones del “gobierno argentino” como favorables a la postura e intereses de Teherán: el “gobierno argentino” ahora apoyaba sus intereses, esto es, la desincriminación de los ciudadanos iraníes en la causa judicial y consecuentemente, la desvinculación de Irán y de la comunidad iraní local de la sospecha de su participación en el atentado. Incluso los partícipes del encubrimiento dieron por sentado la desincriminación de los iraníes y el consecuente blanqueo de la comunidad, y comenzaron a planificar proyectos futuros. En ese sentido, “Alian” sostuvo: “...hay un montón de temas que tenemos que ir armándolo ...con inteligencia...estamos muy bien y hay que laburar tranquilos ....tenemos que hacer un trabajo de acá a 10 años...¿me entendés? Que en un año y medio tengamos las buenas noticias, pero acá hay que hacer un trabajo para mucho tiempo...” (Comunicación del 6/2/2013, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276). Tiempo después, los agentes iraníes continuaban operando con la misma idea: “...Es un tema de largo plazo, para trabajarlo bien...Hay que instalar un poco cuatro, cinco “verdades” fuertes, hay que instalarlas...” (Comunicación del 3/10/2014, abonado 11-6224-0263, Archivo B-1009-2014-10-03-223900- 28). Adviértase que “Alian” y Khalil tenían la seguridad que los iraníes iban a quedar liberados de la imputación de la justicia, “que en un año y medio tengamos las buenas noticias” es la expresión inequívoca que refleja ese pensamiento. Ya habían dado por removido ese obstáculo y se colocaban en otro horizonte, un escalón más arriba, pensando estratégicamente de acá a varios años. En definitiva, no fueron dos partes negociando un acuerdo, como se lo quiso presentar públicamente, son dos socios buscando borrar del modo más creíble posible, una imputación penal por un delito de lesa humanidad. VI.- Canales paralelos de comunicación y negociación El plan criminal que aquí se pone en evidencia y se denuncia de ninguna forma debe ser confundido con una negociación diplomática, aunque su ejecución haya incluido contactos diplomáticos formales. Lo cierto es que la calidad delictiva del plan también se evidencia en la necesidad de contar con esos canales paralelos, no oficiales, como vías concretas, eficientes y confiables para avanzar con el propósito que verdaderamente ha tenido el acercamiento y las negociaciones diplomáticas formales: la impunidad de los acusados iraníes por el caso AMIA. Como se mencionó previamente, existen múltiples elementos probatorios que corroboran la existencia de canales de comunicación y negociación paralelos al oficial, aunque interconectados con el mismo, que facilitaron los contactos entre Teherán y Buenos Aires a los fines del objetivo delictivo. Al referirse a un mensaje concreto, Khalil lo ilustró diciendo: “...me tiraron un dato que hay que laburarlo, que me dijeron que lo tengo que transmitir ...bueno, muchachos, tírenle ésta a los interlocutores de allá para que hablen con los interlocutores de acá... ” (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-04-130024- 6, CD 182). En otras palabras los canales paralelos contaban con “ interlocutores de acá” e “interlocutores de allá Estas pruebas dejaron al descubierto a un grupo de individuos estrechamente vinculado con funcionarios y ex funcionarios de ambos gobiernos que, desde la sombras, contribuyeron estratégica y sustancialmente con las acciones necesarias para avanzar con el objetivo criminal planeado. Entre ellos, cabe destacar la activa participación de Luis Ángel D'EIía, Fernando Luis Esteche, Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, el Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, Héctor Luis Yrimia y el individuo identificado como “Alian” perteneciente a la Secretaría de Inteligencia, orgánica o inorgánicamente, y que podría tratarse de Ramón Héctor Alian Bogado, sea este su verdadero nombre o el que utiliza en su actividad de inteligencia. Estos sujetos, implicados en la maniobra de encubrimiento, se encuentran vinculados entre sí. Véase que Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil se comunicó asiduamente con D’Elía, con Esteche, con “Alian”, con Yrimia y se reunió en varias oportunidades con Larroque. A su vez, “Alian” e Yrimia responden al mismo sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia. Estos dos últimos personajes le fueron presentados a Khalil por parte de Fernando Esteche, lo que implica que los conocía previamente. Las vinculaciones entre D’Elía y Larroque, D’Elía y Esteche y Larroque y Esteche, son públicas. Lo que parece un trabalenguas farragoso para la lectura en realidad es la demostración concreta que estos sujetos no solo se conocen sino que han tenido actividades conjuntas y, según las pruebas expuestas a lo largo de esta presentación, todos han participado en la ejecución del plan de encubrimiento. Queda expuesta así, la estrecha y promiscua vinculación entre los partícipes del plan de encubrimiento. Ahora bien, se cuenta con profusa prueba que da cuenta de la existencia de mensajes concretos relativos al objeto de esta denuncia, que han sido comunicados entre autoridades de ambos países por estos canales no oficiales. No cabe duda alguna, la actividad de estos canales de comunicación y negociación configura, sin más, una diplomacia paralela de facto. Aún antes de que se hubiera firmado el “Memorando de Entendimiento”, ya en noviembre de 2012, se negociaba por fuera de los canales diplomáticos, esto es, por vías ajenas a las reuniones que paralelamente se mantenían en Suiza. En otras palabras, mientras la diplomacia formal se reunía en la Confederación Helvética, los mensajes ocultos entre Teherán y Buenos Aires transitaban, en paralelo, otros carriles. Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil explicaba: “...vengo de La Matanza recién he tenido una reunión con Luis D'E/ia y el “Cuervo” Larroque, el de la Cámpora...que me llamaron temprano que querían hablar conmigo, que tenían un mensaje para el gobierno para dar... Y ahora me voy para Martínez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador...”, en referencia al Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, máxima autoridad oficial en territorio nacional (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-17- 104846-10.wav, CD 195). Esta misma secuencia la relató en otra comunicación telefónica: “...volví a las once de la noche de Martínez....Me fui a La Matanza, estuve hablando con el Cuervo Larroque y con D'Elía...de ahí me tuve que ir a la casa del embajador a hablar con el embajador para mandar un mensaje que me mandaron...” y agregó: “...Larroque...se sentó conmigo y me dio un mensaje que tengo que transmitir a la embajada. Fui a la embajada y transmití lo que tenía, pero no fui a la embajada, me tuve que ir hasta Martínez...”. Y explicó respecto de su relación con las autoridades argentinas: “...yo no estoy operando para ellos, yo estoy operando para los nuestros, para lo que es la embajada...ellos me mandaron a hacer una cosa, yo como soy el nexo...” (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18-100116- 6, CD 196). Al día siguiente que Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil regresó de un viaje a la República Islámica de Irán, donde se entrevistó “con las más altas esferas...con los responsables capos...con la cancillería...” (Comunicación del 11/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-05-11- 173407-12, CD 0022), se comunicó con Luis D'Elía y quedaron en reunirse, no obstante lo cual le adelantó que había desazón en Irán, aparentemente por el incumplimiento de Timerman, y que -además- no habían gustado algunas declaraciones públicas de funcionarios argentinos: “...no gustó algunas palabras que se dijeron....el comentario ese que dijo: ""¡A ver si ustedes se piensan que a mí me gusta negociar con fulanito, con los iraníes!”....eso quedó para el orto, pero igual yo te lo voy a transmitir bien cosa que vos lo transmitas por abajo...como quien no quiere la cosa...” (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-ll-083146-8.wav, CD 0022, el subrayado es propio). Los mensajes, con toda su tonalidad, llegaban directamente de Teherán a la Casa Rosada. Estos son ejemplos contundentes que prueban que ciertas autoridades argentinas utilizaron estos canales de comunicación paralelos, no oficiales y totalmente secretos para avanzar con el plan de encubrimiento. También queda perfectamente constatado el rol de cada uno de estos actores: Larroque, D'Elía y Khalil, cumplen en la maniobra criminal. Funcionan como nexos entre las máximas autoridades políticas argentinas e iraníes. Es más, Larroque es quien recibe de la Presidente, por lo general, las ordenes que luego llegan a Luis D'Elía. Tan claro como inaudito. Estos canales también fueron utilizados para hacerle llegar información actualizada a Mohsen Rabbani, uno de los imputados por el atentado contra la AMIA, de distintos aspectos configurativos del plan destinado a encubrirlo. Cabe recordar el poder decisorio que éste imputado sigue manteniendo, que le ha permitido intervenir directa y personalmente en las negociaciones entre iraníes y argentinos. Nótese que la actitud de Rabbani no es la de un prófugo preocupado por su situación procesal o por la evolución de la acusación en su contra. Al contrario, al poseer un alto grado de seguridad que se mantendrá impune gracias a la protección del régimen de su país, tiene tiempo y energías para continuar dando órdenes a la distancia y digitando el accionar de la comunidad chiita en Argentina. Por si ello fuera poco, últimamente ha tomado incluso mayor confianza al advertir la buena predisposición de las autoridades del gobierno argentino para con su persona. Ello se ve reflejado en sus diálogos. “...Yo les dije que nosotros ...habíamos conversado con Argentina...Irán fue el primer comprador de Argentina y ahora no compra casi nada...pero...puede cambiar esta situación con ustedes y con el gobierno”, en alusión a los actuales referentes de Irán en Argentina, como Khalil, y las autoridades del presente gobierno argentino (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Otro ejemplo de ello es el reporte de Jorge Khalil cuando comunicó:	“...hoy terminamos una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas...”, a lo que Rabbani respondió: “...Mándame para que evalúe...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 114842-2, CD 31). Y, luego de analizarlo, contestó: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina...y también comprar armas... ” (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). También cabe hacer referencia que estos canales paralelos han sido utilizados para digitar acciones y comportamientos que facilitaron -de distintas maneras- el avance del plan de impunidad. Por ejemplo, para noviembre de 2012, tanto Luis D'Elía como Andrés Larroque le solicitaron a Khalil que no se sumara a una marcha organizada por partidos de izquierda en defensa de la “causa palestina” y, también, que cesara con los reproches y reclamos, porque ese tipo de acciones podían repercutir en las nuevas relaciones bilaterales. Así lo explicaba Khalil: “...no queremos hacer algo que irrite...no queremos irritar al gobierno argentino...no voy a hacer nada para irritar al gobierno argentino... ” y agregó “...estamos arreglando un problema mayor para nosotros...”, en alusión a las imputaciones por el atentado contra la AMIA, y ello ameritaba cautela. Khalil comprendió el riesgo de participar de estos actos: “...Me imagino que los troskos van a empezar con mensajes en contra del gobierno, cosa que yo no quiero...” (Comunicación del 16/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	11 -16-225815-2, CD 194). El plan de encubrimiento demandaba todas las precauciones posibles. Respecto al mismo tema Khalil agregó: “...Hoy a la mañana tuve una reunión con la gente del gobierno, me pidieron que por favor no vaya a la reunión... ” y le dijeron: “...pará la bronca porque el tema de...puede repercutir en las relaciones que están manteniendo, las conversaciones que estamos teniendo nosotros en Ginebra... ” (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	11-17-183444-8, CD 195). Y decidió: “...Entonces no quiero que ninguno de nosotros, que representa a la República Islámica de una u otra manera, como vos, como Ghaleb, como yo, como cualquiera de Flores o de la comunidad nuestra, no tiene que ir a ninguno de esos, no va a participar, en tanto y en cuanto Israel no invada....Ahora, si Israel invade...nosotros armamos un frente, no con los troskos ni con los de izquierda, con los kirchneristas, La Cámpora y todos esos van a acompañarnos. Ya lo hablé con Larroquey con D'Elía... ” (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-17-183444-8, CD 195). Y	reiteró:	“	...nosotros no estamos haciendo ninguna manifestación acá, porque estamos en plenas negociaciones con el gobierno...a esa reunión la convoqué y o...pero después la tiré para atrás ...porque en base a las negociaciones que se están haciendo entre Irán y Argentina, no queremos vernos inmiscuidos nosotros. Aparte fue un pedido del gobierno. Yo estuve hablando con D'Elía y con el Cuervo Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmití al Safir...y el Safir me dijo lo mismo... 'no hagamos algo que, que pueda molestar'....” (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18- 095153-16, CD 196). En conversación con Fernando Esteche expresó “...el sábado fui a la casa del gordo, hablé con el gordo y el gordo adelante mío lo llamó al cuervo, puso el altavoz...Cuervo, estoy con Yussefbla bla bla...le estoy diciendo que lo que me dijiste que transmita. Así, eh?...”. A esta altura, sobra aclarar que cuando se alude al “gordo” y al “cuervo”, se está haciendo referencia a Luis D'Elía y Andrés Larroque, respectivamente (Comunicación del 19/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	11-19-121034-16, CD 197). De esta serie de comunicaciones, puede concluirse que Khalil no estaba dispuesto a involucrarse, como referente de Irán, en un ataque al gobierno por parte de “los troskos” y/o cualquier agrupación política, para no poner en peligro las negociaciones que se mantenían con Teherán. D'Elía y Larroque compartían esta preocupación y trabajaron para que Khalil y sus seguidores se mantuvieran al margen de cualquier manifestación y/o crítica pública al gobierno por la posición adoptada ante hechos internacionales relacionados con el conflicto palestino-israelí. Tanto Larroque como D’Elía efectuaron sus aportes para asegurar y mantener el mejor clima posible entre las partes, mientras se ejecutaba el plan de encubrimiento ordenado por Cristina Fernández y llevado adelante por Héctor Timerman. Otro ejemplo que demuestra la voluntad de proteger el plan de encubrimiento se desprende del episodio que tuvo lugar el 29 de mayo de 2013, cuando tomó estado público el dictamen de esta Unidad Fiscal sobre la profundización de ciertos aspectos relativos al atentado contra la AMIA, entre los que se estudiaba, la infiltración de la región por parte de estructuras de inteligencia iraní. En esa ocasión, Jorge Khalil y otros miembros de la comunidad local planeaban hacer algún tipo de descargo público, pero recibieron indicaciones desde Irán de abstenerse de ello, para no hacer peligrar las relaciones con Argentina y, obviamente, la maniobra encubridora. Al respecto, sostuvo: “...le están pidiendo que no hagamos nada...el de acá ya me dijo no hagamos nada, no hagamos nada, no hagamos nada, pero no hagamos nada porque no quiere que se pudra en la relación de ellos...” (Comunicación del 04/06/2013, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-04-082254-20, CD 46). En este caso, las indicaciones de Teherán le llegaron a Khalil a través de Abdul Karim Paz, que es quien “le están pidiendo que no hagamos nadan y con “el de acá”, alude al Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina. En suma, el encubrimiento era lo más importante y no debía verse afectado por cuestiones coyunturales. Por último, estos canales paralelos contribuyeron al desarrollo de acciones destinadas a la creación de una versión alternativa y falsa sobre el atentado, verosímil a la opinión pública, que permita redireccionar la pesquisa hacia “nuevos imputados”, encubriendo en forma definitiva a los acusados iraníes, a quienes las pruebas y las distintas resoluciones judiciales los involucran muy claramente en el atentado. Ilustran este punto las numerosas comunicaciones entre el referente iraní Jorge Khalil y otros partícipes, fundamentalmente, Fernando Esteche, Héctor Yrimia y el agente de inteligencia “Alian”. Para mayor abundamiento, corresponde remitirse a lo desarrollado en el punto IV.c.3.b de la presente. En suma, en los puntos anteriores se han ejemplificado episodios que muestran el modo en que circularon mensajes, pedidos, inquietudes, información, etc., de un lado al otro del conjunto de individuos involucrados en el plan de encubrimiento aquí expuesto. Lo descripto en este punto permite visualizar el modo mediante el cual los autores del plan lograron establecer un vínculo indirecto, a través del conjunto de intermediarios, no sólo con los referentes iraníes en Teherán sino con uno de los imputados por el atentado contra la AMIA, Mohsen Rabbani, cuya detención con fines de extradición ha sido exhortada por la justicia argentina y es requerido con la máxima prioridad de búsqueda por Interpol. A continuación corresponde analizar el rol y los aportes de cada uno de los individuos antes mencionados, que tuvieron participación en el plan criminal aquí denunciado. a)	Cristina Elisabet Fernández Para comprender el rol de la Dra. Cristina Fernández en este plan de impunidad debe quedar claro que el delito denunciado no se hubiera cometido sin su decisión y sus consecuentes acciones. En efecto, la Sra. Presidente de la Nación Argentina ha emitido una expresa directiva para que se diseñara y ejecutara un plan de encubrimiento tendiente a desvincular a los acusados de nacionalidad iraní en la causa por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, a efectos de garantizarles su impunidad definitiva. Dicha decisión estuvo motivada en la búsqueda de un acercamiento de carácter geopolítico como así también en el restablecimiento de plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal con la República Islámica de Irán, por entender que así podría atenuarse sustancialmente la crisis energética nacional, mediante intercambios mercantiles de “petróleo por granos”. La circunstancia que haya sido la más alta autoridad de la República quién ordenó la ejecución de estas acciones delictivas implica que lo aquí se denuncia es de una gravedad institucional enorme. Analizada la evidencia con el máximo grado de rigor, surge de modo inequívoco la participación de la primera mandataria en el plan criminal aquí denunciado. En varias oportunidades, los partícipes del plan criminal han hecho referencia a ello, asegurando que todo está: “cerrado muy arriba”, todo había sido decidido “al más alto niver porque “lo pidió la jefa” y su canciller, obediente, implemento el plan porque fue “orden, orden y orden” (Comunicación del 6/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276, Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-111124-8, CD 31; Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 01 -28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). No puede soslayarse la consternación que provoca constatar que la Sra. Presidente se encuentre involucrada en una vil maquinación, destinada nada menos que a dejar de lado la búsqueda de justicia en la causa que investiga el mayor atentado terrorista sufrido en la historia argentina.   Ministerio Público de la Nación Lamentablemente, como es de público conocimiento, no es la primera vez que el conductor de los destinos de la Nación cae inmerso en acciones criminales para desviar la investigación del caso AMIA. Tal fue el grado de compromiso que asumió la Dra. Fernández en este plan criminal de impunidad que se ocupó de seleccionar muy cuidadosamente a algunos de sus colaboradores o, para ser más exactos, sus cómplices, valiéndose de distintas personas para ejecutar el plan. Ese ha sido uno de sus aportes fundamentales para la instrumentación del plan. Cuando se observan y se analizan las credenciales de cada uno de los partícipes, puede advertirse que la elección fue acertada pues todos poseen los antecedentes y las condiciones necesarias para cumplir fielmente los encargos de la Presidente. En primer lugar, se valió de un sujeto identificado como “Alian”, hombre de su entorno, consustanciado con el régimen iraní, contacto directo del máximo referente de dicho país en Argentina y miembro de la Secretaría de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación; para que asista al señor canciller en todas aquellas acciones, relacionadas con la implementación del plan de encubrimiento, que por ser notoriamente delictivas, de ninguna manera convendría que fueran realizadas por un encumbrado ministro nacional. La circunstancia de que “Alian” cumpla funciones -orgánicas o inorgánicas- para el organismo de inteligencia nacional no es un dato menor. Todo lo contrario, dicha pertenencia le permite aprovechar los recursos de tal secretaría de estado, lo que lo hace especialmente apto para cumplir con su tarea. También encargó al dirigente Luis D’Elía que se ocupe de transmitir y recibir todos los mensajes que circularon a través de los canales paralelos de comunicación y negociación desarrollados para llevar a buen puerto el encubrimiento. La decisión de la Presidente, en este caso, también fue apropiada pues D’Elía ha sido, por muchos años, no solo acérrimo defensor del régimen iraní sino, según sus propios dichos, un “soldado” incondicional de Cristina Fernández. Asimismo, escogió al Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, otro encendido seguidor de la Presidente, que ofició de nexo, de puente entre ella y los partícipes clandestinos del plan de impunidad. La necesidad de contar con un intermediario es obvia. Tratándose de la ejecución de un delito, la primera mandataria ha preferido, astutamente, mantenerse incomunicada de aquellas personas que ejecutan las acciones criminales. Dado que los cómplices debían actuar siguiendo sus órdenes, resultó imperioso contar con una persona de extrema confianza que pudiera justificar su vinculación personal tanto con la Dra. Cristina Fernández como con Luis D’Elía y dicho sujeto resultó ser el nombrado Larroque. Y	principalmente, delegó gran parte de la instrumentación del plan criminal en su Canciller, Héctor Timerman, a quien inicialmente ordenó que contacte a los representantes iraníes a los fines de hacerles saber la predisposición del gobierno argentino a dejar de lado cualquier reclamo de justicia en relación al caso AMIA, a cambio de un acercamiento comercial entre ambos países, lo que comenzó en 2011 en la ciudad de Alepo. En concreto, por orden presidencial, Timerman se apartó de la comitiva oficial que visitaba distintos países de Medio Oriente, para dirigirse a la ciudad siria de Alepo, lugar donde mantuvo, en secreto, una reunión con el canciller iraní, Ali Salehi. Allí transmitió el siguiente mensaje: “...la Argentina ya no está más interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados, pero en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones económicas con Irán... ” (Ys. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). Sus instrucciones incluyeron la autorización para que el Ministro Timerman negociara e instrumentara, en forma secreta, el plan de impunidad que removería el escollo que significa la acusación judicial argentina contra los ciudadanos iraníes. Dicho plan, incluyó la decisión presidencial de instrumentar en el Memorando de Entendimiento un Al BERTO NISMAN FISCAL GENERAL mecanismo que permita disponer el cese de las notificaciones rojas, por ser ese el único real interés del régimen iraní. Y ello quedó plasmado en el punto séptimo del pacto. El plan de impunidad pergeñado por la Dra. Fernández fue mucho más allá del cese de estas prioridades de búsqueda de Interpol e incluyó la desvinculación definitiva de los imputados iraníes. Por eso, su instrumentación conllevó la creación de una “Comisión de la Verdad”, como se dispuso en el pacto, cuyas conclusiones estaban arregladas de antemano y garantizarían la acordada impunidad. En conocimiento de esta circunstancia, se dijo: “...alguien va a salir...con la cara manchada de acá...”, a lo que Jorge Khalil, referente de Irán, reconoció: “...Obvio, eso ya está arreglado...”, pero aclaró que no iban a ser de los iraníes los perjudicados y remató: “... ¡¿cómo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo?! Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa..y (Comunicación del 27/1/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266). Asimismo, como se demostró, autorizó a su canciller a sellar acuerdos secretos con los representantes iraníes que, según las pruebas incorporadas a la causa, garantizaban el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol y el otorgamiento de un salvoconducto al ex Ministro de Defensa de Irán, Ahmad Vahidi, asegurándole que nunca sería interrogado. La existencia de pactos secretos fue puesta de manifiesto por el entonces Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores Iraní, Ali Akbar Salehi cuando dijo: “...El [contenido] del acuerdo entre Irán y Argentina en relación con la cuestión de la AMIA será hecho público en el momento adecuado y la cuestión [de los imputados iraníes] está incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo...'’’’ (“Tehran insists accord with Argentina includes Interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects”, Mercopress, 19/03/2013) y por los partícipes del encubrimiento que expresaron: “...estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares también... ” (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-11-083146- 8.wav, CD 0022); y “...es pescado podrido, después hablamos personalmente ....está dentro del marco eso....se sabía....es más profundo todavía... ” (Comunicación del 12/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-12-100525-14, CD 282). Otra directiva expresa de la Sra. Presidente, esta vez canalizada a través del agente “Alian”, fue la orden de construir una hipótesis falsa, sostenida en pruebas inventadas, para incriminar a “nuevos autores del atentado”, que serían acusados con el fin de desvincular definitivamente del hecho a los imputados iraníes. Justamente, “Alian” dio cuenta de esta orden, al reconocer que el suscripto “...va a hacer culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas...lo que viene ahora... es una prueba contundente...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Esta cuestión ya había sido mencionada por Fernando Esteche, otro partícipe del plan, quien aun antes de suscribirse el memorando, dijo: “...quieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA...”, tarea a cargo de los servicios de inteligencia. Según señaló Esteche, como “no van a poder decir que fueron los israelíes”, porque -claramente- no sería creíble, tenían que armar una hipótesis falsa, y hasta hablaron de involucrar a “una conexión de fachos locales” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Otro aporte destacable al plan ha sido el anuncio que efectuó ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, el 25 de septiembre de 2012,	ocasión en la informó que, en respuesta a un pedido efectuado una semana atrás por la República Islámica de Irán, había instruido a su canciller, Héctor Timerman, que inicie un proceso de negociación con dicho país. Esta contribución al plan resultó fundamental, porque en el relato oficial respaldado por la Sra. Presidente se pretendió -y así se hizo- ocultar que ya venían manteniéndose un año y medio de negociaciones secretas y que el acercamiento se había materializado por iniciativa de Argentina, y no de Irán, como se afirmó. No podía reconocer públicamente que le había ordenado a su Canciller que ofreciera a las autoridades iraníes impunidad para sus nacionales, a cambio de un acercamiento geopolítico y comercial. Como ya se dijo, este plan criminal exigió contar con el mayor apoyo posible de la opinión pública y -fundamentalmente- de las víctimas, respecto del acuerdo que se firmaría y se firmó con Irán, como una forma de facilitar su ejecución. Para ello, se ocultaron las negociaciones previas y la iniciativa Argentina, y con el mismo fin, en septiembre de 2012, la Sra. Presidente prometió, a sabiendas de que no cumpliría, que consultaría a familiares y víctimas, previo adoptar cualquier temperamento sobre las tratativas con Teherán. Solamente buscaba inspirar una falsa confianza en las víctimas del atentado, prometiéndoles que serían consultados, para luego sorprenderlos con el acuerdo ya consumado, el domingo 27 de enero de 2013 (Discurso de Cristina Fernández ante la 67a Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, de fecha 25 de septiembre de 2012; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información para la prensa N° 011/13). En la misma línea, y abusando de su cargo y funciones, continuó encabezando el despliegue de una versión oficial y falsa de los hechos, para ocultar la criminalidad del verdadero plan. Así, presentó al Memorando de Entendimiento como un “logro histórico” (Mensajes de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 de horas: 10:26 a 10:32). El mismo día de la aprobación emitió en su cuenta oficial de Twitter, una seguidilla de mensajes que pretendieron instalar la noticia como una “victoria”, ello a fin de mantener oculto el verdadero sentido del Memorando de Entendimiento: brindar un marco jurídico creíble para instrumentar solapadamente la impunidad de los acusados iraníes y así, viabilizar políticamente el acercamiento geopolítico y comercial con Teherán. Continuó en esa tesitura cuando, en su mensaje de elevación del anteproyecto de ley de aprobación del Memorando al Congreso Nacional, sostuvo: “...Se quiere presentar el acuerdo como una especie de argucia para ‘iniciar ’ el comercio con Irán. Lo cierto es que ese comercio existe desde 1990 y, salvo los años 2004 y 2005, ha sido superávit ario...” (Mensaje Presidencial N° 173 de elevación al Congreso Nacional del anteproyecto de ley sobre el Memorando de Entendimiento entre Argentina e Irán). Maliciosamente, la Sra. Presidente se estaba refiriendo al comercio entre privados. No podía admitir que había decidido aniquilar la justicia en el caso AMIA a cambio de establecer un comercio a nivel estatal que no existía y que buscaba retomar. A pesar de negar públicamente que el comercio fuera un interés en la vinculación con Irán, en forma secreta, la Sra. Presidente buscó poner en práctica su decisión de comerciar con Teherán, encomendando gestiones a su Ministro de Planificación Federal, Arquitecto Julio De Vido. Para ello, le ordenó que avance en las tratativas para intercambiar petróleo por granos a través de los canales paralelos de comunicación con el régimen. Así lo reconoció Luis D'Elía: “...la reunión fue porque la pidió la jefa...”, en referencia a su encuentro con De Vido y afirmó: “...acá estuve hablando con el ‘quía’ [en alusión al Ministro De Vido]....e//os están dispuestos a mandar la gente de YPF con nosotros dos, a hacer negocios allá....está muy interesado en intercambiar lo de aquellos por granos y carne allá...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-111124-8, CD31). El compromiso con los damnificados por el atentado era nulo, al punto que ya para el mes de mayo de 2013, el Poder Ejecutivo Nacional, por orden de la Dra. Fernández, se hallaba embarcado en negociaciones secretas con Irán para intercambiar petróleo por carne y granos. Y, como ya se probó, de estas mismas tratativas comerciales participó Mohsen Rabbani, uno de los acusados en la causa AMIA. Ejemplo de ello es la ocasión en que Khalil le informó a Rabbani: “...hoy terminamos una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas... ”, a lo que Rabbani contestó: “mándeme para que evalúe” y luego de evaluarlo respondió: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina...y también comprar armas.. ’’(Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31 y del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Es decir, mientras públicamente la Sra. Presidente aseguraba que sus acciones estaban exclusivamente motivadas en la búsqueda de justicia para la causa AMIA y que el Memorando de Entendimiento era la única solución viable para el caso, uno de esos acusados, Mohsen Rabbani, secreta y clandestinamente negociaba con nuestras autoridades a través de intermediarios y canales ocultos un intercambio de petróleo por granos, la venta de armas y, lo que es más grave, su propia impunidad. La siguiente contribución para la consecución del plan de impunidad fue instalar, desde lo más alto del poder, la versión de que la causa por la investigación del atentado contra la sede de la AMIA estaba paralizada, con la intención de confundir a la opinión pública y así poder presentar ante la sociedad argentina que el Memorando de Entendimiento - recuérdese, el instrumento diseñado para viabilizar la impunidad de los acusados iraníes- era la única salida posible. Dicha intervención se desdobló en varios episodios y se mantuvo a lo largo del tiempo. En efecto, en su mensaje por cadena nacional del 8 de febrero de 2013, en ocasión de comunicar el envío del anteproyecto de ley de ratificación del Memorando al Congreso Nacional expresó: “...Este memorándum que hemos acordado es un paso adelante para destrabar una causa que hace 19 años que está paral izada... ” (Discurso de Cristina Fernández del 8/2/13). En marzo de 2013, escribió en las redes sociales “...teníamos que destrabar esto...”, obviamente en alusión a la causa AMIA (Twitter del 4/3/2013 17:05) y ante la Asamblea Legislativa: “...mi compromiso es intentar destrabar esto...'1'' (Mensaje de la Presidente a la Asamblea Legislativa con motivo de la apertura del 131° período de sesiones ordinarias del Congreso de la Nación, 1/3/2013). Volvió a la carga con la misma mentira en su discurso ante 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, la Sra. Presidente afirmó: “...la causa está estancada, desde hace 19 años que no se moviliza...'’'’ (Discurso ante Naciones Unidas del 24 de septiembre de 2013). Lo paradójico del caso es que la Sra. Presidente conoce, sin lugar a dudas, que la causa ha avanzado, máxime teniendo en cuenta la amplia publicidad que tuvieron los sucesivos dictámenes de esta Unidad Fiscal y diferentes pronunciamientos judiciales, por lo que sus expresiones en sentido contrario solo puede ser tomadas como una manifestación concreta del dolo con que ha actuado buscando desprestigiar a la justicia argentina como un modo indirecto de legitimar un acuerdo bilateral -léase Memorando de Entendimiento- que es la base de un plan criminal por ella misma ideado. Otra de sus contribuciones tuvo lugar el viernes 27 de septiembre de 2013, un día antes del encuentro entre los Ministros de Relaciones Exteriores argentino e iraní, cuando le ordenó al cómplice Luis D’Elía que transmitiera un mensaje al agente persa Jorge Khalil. Así lo reconoció D'Elía: “...tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar para allá urgente, antes de mañana....estoy en la casa de gobierno ahora...no hay asunto más importante que éste, creémelo...’’’’ (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-103753-14, CD 161). Además, Luis D’Elía le solicitó a Khalil “necesito que hables con el sheik allá [en alusión a Mohsen Rabbani]...w/ra que es muy groso lo que tengo, eh...me lo pidió...'’’’ (Comunicaciones del 27/9/13, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-114113-28, CD 161; Archivo B- 1009-2013-09-27-104245-8.txt, CD 161). El nombrado Khalil especificó el pedido de Cristina Fernández, ..Necesita que el gobierno iraní junto con el gobierno argentino mañana anuncie la conformación de la ‘Comisión de la Verdad' ...que por favor lo anuncien en conjunto mañana en la reunión...que se defina el día de la reunión de la ‘Comisión de la Verdad ’ y también que se defina el día, en el mes de enero, en que el juez argentino pueda viajar a Teherán...” (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-115448-6, CD 161). Luego se aclaró: “...la reunión se hace de apuro a pedido de Cristina...fíjate que Rohani [el Presidente de Irán] ni habló del tema AMIA en su discurso...” (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4966, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161). De los aportes concretos y específicos de la Sra. Presidente que se han podido acreditar con sólido sustento probatorio, surge con claridad que no solamente fue quien decidió la articulación de este plan criminal de impunidad y, para ello, se valió de distintos actores para llevar adelante su ejecución, sino que en todo momento estuvo en control de la misma, ya sea impartiendo órdenes directas a sus cómplices, o bien encabezando la necesaria campaña discursiva para camuflar la perpetración del delito. Se está en presencia de la persona que ejerce el máximo cargo público de la República Argentina. De allí que su responsabilidad sea enorme. Lamentablemente, ha decidido cometer un delito para brindar impunidad a los prófugos iraníes de la causa AMIA; ha elegido a algunos partícipes de la maniobra delictiva, involucrando directamente a -cuanto menos- uno de sus ministros y a un legislador nacional; ha controlado la evolución del plan; ha negociado por interpósitas personas con uno de los prófugos; y se ha involucrado personalmente en algunas acciones de ocultamiento que este sofisticado plan requería. Los episodios relatados en este capítulo así lo demuestran. b)	Héctor Marcos Timerman El Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, Héctor Timerman, ha sido -sin duda alguna- el principal instrumentador del plan de impunidad ideado y ordenado por la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fernández. Naturalmente, tratándose de un plan criminal que ha involucrado a un país extranjero, el Canciller ocupaba el puesto clave para encargarse personalmente de muchos aspectos de este encubrimiento. Desde su función, transmitió a Irán la decisión del gobierno argentino de abandonar el reclamo de justicia en la causa AMIA; acordó la baja de las notificaciones rojas; signó acuerdos secretos con la parte iraní; participó de las negociaciones, de la redacción y de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, pieza central del plan de impunidad. Y se involucró personalmente en la campaña de descrédito y engaño, destinada a destruir la credibilidad de la causa judicial con el fin de, dolosamente, presentar al acuerdo con Irán como la única vía apta para solucionar el caso. El repaso concreto de cada una de sus intervenciones y aportes al plan delictivo aquí denunciado demuestra con absoluta claridad y solidez probatoria que Héctor Timerman resultó ser un actor esencial en la maniobra para lograr la impunidad prevista para los acusados iraníes. La prueba en su contra es abrumadora. En efecto, el comienzo de su actuación criminal coincidió con el inicio de la ejecución del delito. Por orden presidencial, se apartó de la comitiva oficial que visitaba distintos países de Medio Oriente, para dirigirse a la ciudad siria de Alepo, lugar donde mantuvo, en secreto, una reunión con el canciller iraní, Ali Salehi. Allí transmitió el siguiente mensaje: “...la Argentina ya no está más interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados, pero en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones económicas con Irán... ” ffs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Polémica en tomo a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). En este plan, Héctor Timerman comandó las tratativas con los representantes iraníes, aquellas que se mantuvieron en secreto y también las que tomaron estado público. Es decir, Timerman desempeñó un rol central en la negociación con la contraparte iraní, para convenir la impunidad definitiva de los prófugos, así como el cese de las notificaciones rojas. Una contribución central al plan de impunidad del Ministro Timerman ha sido, sin lugar a dudas, la suscripción del Memorando de 18	El día mundial de Al Quds, simboliza la unidad de las naciones, en particular, de los musulmanes, con el fin de apoyar a los palestinos contra los Estados Unidos y el régimen israelí. w Ministerio Público de la Nación	alberto nis^wn I Entendimiento en representación de la República Argentina, pues se trató de una acción definitiva en la ejecución del plan criminal. Con la firma de este acuerdo Timerman aportó el instrumento legal necesario para el plan criminal, dado que permite encubrir a los acusados de distintas maneras: a) propiciando el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol (punto 7); b) garantizando impunidad mediante la instauración acordada de un procedimiento intrincado, infinito, que no conduce a nada y que solo diluye acusaciones y viabiliza desincriminación, alternativa notablemente favorecida por la ausencia total de plazos que marquen la implementación del acuerdo; y c) articulando, a través de la “Comisión de la Verdad” creada en el pacto, la desvinculación total de los imputados respecto del atentado contra la AMIA, permitiendo redireccionar la pesquisa hacia otros autores e hipótesis. En efecto, como se ha sostenido y probado, el Memorando de Entendimiento no pretendió que los acusados iraníes declararan ante el juez y el fiscal de la causa AMIA. Todo lo contrario, se trató de uno de los medios elegidos por los socios del plan criminal para eliminar las imputaciones de la justicia argentina y para, en definitiva, garantizar su definitiva impunidad en la causa. Además de la suscripción del Memorando de Entendimiento, otro aporte al plan criminal, por parte del Ministro Timerman, ha sido la concreción de otros acuerdos de carácter secreto, que incluyen -justamente- el cese de las notificaciones rojas, y también conceden beneficios mayores como, por ejemplo, que el ex Ministro de Defensa, Ahmad Vahidi, aun con el acuerdo vigente, jamás se presentaría ante el juez de la causa. Existen comunicaciones telefónicas obtenidas de intervenciones judicialmente dispuestas que dan cuenta de estos acuerdos secretos al hablar, por ejemplo, de que “estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares también” (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-ll-083146-8.wav, CD 0022). O cuando, en relación a la noticia que informaba que Vahidi no sería interrogado a pesar de lo previsto en el Memorando, el referente local de Irán, que evidentemente contaba con información de primera mano, manifestó: “...es pescado podrido, después hablamos personalmente ....está dentro del marco es o.... se sabía.... es más profundo todavía... ” (Comunicación del 12/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-12-100525-14, CD 282). Y como si todos estos indicios no fueran suficientes, el propio Canciller Salehi hizo referencia a la existencia de otros acuerdos secretos con Timerman (“Tehran insists accord with Argentina includes Interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects”, Mercopress, 19/03/2013). Luce evidente que el compromiso de Timerman, por orden de la Sra. Presidente, fue gestionar el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, dado que se trataba del interés primordial de Irán para firmar el acuerdo. El apego a la legalidad del Organismo Internacional de Policía Criminal frustró este primer objetivo delictivo de los autores de este plan de impunidad. Cuando, por fortuna, Interpol intercedió a tiempo para evitar el cese de las prioridades de búsqueda, informando: “...La Oficina de Asuntos Jurídicos de la Secretaría General de Interpol manifiesta que dicho acuerdo [en referencia al Memorando de Entendimiento entre Argentina e Irán] no implica ningún tipo de cambio en el estatus de las notificaciones rojas publicadas en relación a los crímenes investigados en la causa AMIA...” (Nota N° LA/35678/47/3.1/EGI/tsa, Consejería Jurídica, Secretaría General, Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal, 15/03/13), el Canciller Timerman realizó nuevas acciones destinadas a favorecer el plan criminal y en el mes de mayo de 2013 se reunió con el Secretario General de Interpol, Ronald Noble, en Lyon, Francia, para lograr que Interpol tome en cuenta el acuerdo bilateral y, de tal manera, acceda a conceder la baja de las citadas prioridades de búsqueda, aunque públicamente comunicó lo contrario (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N° 122/13 del 30/5/2013; Interpol, “La visita del canciller argentino a Interpol se centró en la colaboración policial internacional”, 30/05/2013). En ese contexto, los representantes iraníes hicieron notar su disconformidad por el fracaso en la baja de las notificaciones rojas: “...hay un poquito de desazón de allá... Desazón...Me parece que el ruso este de mierda [en alusión a Héctor Timerman] se mandó alguna ...estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares [en referencia a las notificaciones rojas] también...”; “...Timerman no cumplió con algunas cosas. Esto es así de claro. No cumplió con algunas cosas... ” (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-ll-083146-8.wav, CD 0022 y Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-111124-8, CD 31). El Ministro realizó nuevos aportes al plan y en noviembre de 2012,	volvió a reunirse con Noble a quien informó de la continuación de las tratativas entre ambos países, en tomo al memorándum (Interpol, Comunicado de Prensa: “La seguridad mundial, eje de la visita a Interpol del Ministro argentino de Asuntos Exteriores”, Lyon, Francia, 26/11/2013). La intención fue clara: informar a Noble que el Memorando de Entendimiento entre ambos países avanzaba fue una forma sutil e indirecta de solicitar que Interpol reviera su postura y accediera a dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de los iraníes. Sin obtener el resultado anhelado y prometido, el ministro argentino cambió de estrategia e intentó convencer a los iraníes de que las notificaciones rojas cesarían luego de las audiencias. Al respecto se informó: “...En diálogo con su par iraní, Javad Zarif el canciller Timerman consideró que las circulares rojas caerían automáticamente en cuanto el juez que investiga el atentado, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, les tome declaración en Irán a los cinco acusados...'” (Di Natale, Martín, “La negociación con Irán, empantanada por la lista de Interpol”, La Nación 8/12/13). Ahora bien, como quedó claro en esta denuncia, el plan de impunidad no solo necesitó de un camuflaje jurídico, sino también de una estrategia discursiva y mediática para impedir que surja a la luz su oculta   finalidad criminal. En este necesario ocultamiento Héctor Timerman también desempeñó un rol fundamental. En efecto, cuando las negociaciones ya habían tomado estado público, debieron extremarse los cuidados para que nada detenga la ejecución del plan criminal. En ese tren de precauciones que favorecieron la comisión del encubrimiento aquí denunciado, Héctor Timerman abusó del secreto propio que pueden gozar las tratativas diplomáticas para ocultar los avances del plan delictual y, emitió comunicados desde la Cancillería Argentina, para engañar a la opinión pública sobre el contenido de las negociaciones, a fin de garantizar que nada detenga el curso criminal que estaba por culminar. Al inicio de dicho proceso, ambos ministerios emitieron un comunicado conjunto donde dijeron haberse comprometido a explorar mecanismos legales que no estuvieran en contradicción con los sistemas legales de Argentina e Irán (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información para la Prensa 313/12, del 27/9/12). El resultado de estas tratativas fue, justamente, el Memorando de Entendimiento, que luego sería declarado inconstitucional por la Sala I de la Excma. Cámara en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal (CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 “AMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N°6- Secretaría N°ll), lo que evidenció la contradicción con lo anunciado por el Canciller Timerman, en tanto el instrumento jurídico ha vulnerado flagrantemente el sistema legal argentino. En otro comunicado, antes de suscribir el acuerdo, la cartera a cargo de Timerman afirmó: “...El Gobierno Nacional ratifica que el único compromiso es con las víctimas y el derecho de sus familiares a hallar en la verdad y en la justicia la reparación debida. Argentina reafirma que en dicho objetivo no hav lugar para intereses seopolíticos. ni propios, ni ajenos...” (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°360/12, del 31/10/2012, el subrayado es propio). Justamente, como aquí ya se ha probado holgadamente, uno de los intereses centrales de la maniobra criminal ha sido la voluntad de acercamiento geopolítico con Teherán, conforme lo decidiera la Sra. Presidente. Está claro, entonces, que el canciller Timerman obró de mala fe para concretar el plan de impunidad y no tuvo inhibición alguna para realizar acciones ulteriores tendientes a favorecerlo. El dolo que lo caracterizó en toda esta maniobra criminal se puso de manifiesto, por ejemplo, tan sólo dos días después de firmado el Memorando, es decir, el 29 de enero de 2013, cuando el ministro intentó un acercamiento reuniéndose con las entidades comunitarias judías que habían expresado su rechazo al pacto. En esa oportunidad, tal como lo declaró el entonces Presidente de la AMIA, Sr. Guillermo Borger: “...el canciller está dispuesto a generar una nota aclaratoria, una nota anexa con todos estos interrogantes y que él mismo suscribirá...” (Declaraciones de Borger a la Agencia Judía de Noticias, “Borger después de la visita de Timerman a la AMIA”, 29/1/13). En un comunicado oficial, AMIA plasmó el compromiso asumido por el Canciller Timerman de confeccionar un anexo al Memorando que asegurara que las audiencias en Teherán fueran declaraciones indagatorias conforme lo prevé el derecho argentino, que fueran recibidas por autoridades argentinas y que el proceso previsto en el acuerdo no hiciera caer las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. AI respecto, Memoria Activa emitió otro comunicado dando cuenta del mismo compromiso (“AMIA informa a la opinión pública sobre las conclusiones de la reunión mantenida con el canciller Timerman en el día de ayer”, Prensa Judía, 30/01/2013; “La AMIA pide que las promesas de Timerman sean anexadas por escrito al acuerdo original”, Clarín, 30 de enero de 2013; Comunicado de Memoria Activa a la opinión pública, del 31 de enero de 2013). Pese a todo ello, luego de estos comunicados, el Canciller negó haberse comprometido con víctimas, familiares y dirigentes comunitarios a tramitar un anexo al acuerdo (“La AMIA pide al gobierno que rehaga el memorándum con Irán”, La Nación, 1/2/2013; Capiello, Hernán, “Timerman se molestó con la AMIA por sus exigencias”, La Nación, 1/2/2013). En otras palabras, a pesar de lo expuesto y burdo de esta promesa incumplida y negada, Héctor Timerman estaba operando para facilitar y ocultar la maniobra delictiva, aún a costo de su reputación pública. En la tarea de desprestigiar a la investigación judicial, Héctor Timerman volvió a cumplir un papel determinante en esta fase específica del plan delictivo realizando aportes constantes, como en ocasión del tratamiento parlamentario del acuerdo, cuando señaló: “...Por primera vez hay un compromiso por escrito de Irán...para que la causa AMIA pueda salir de la total parálisis en la que se encuentra”, para luego agregar “...proceso judicial en curso, que no ha tenido avances de ningún tipo en los últimos años” (Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Asuntos Constitucionales y de Justicia y Asuntos. Penales de la Cámara de Senadores desarrollado el 13 de febrero de 2013 y Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Justicia y Asuntos Constitucionales de la Cámara de Diputados, Congreso Nacional, desarrollado el 26 de febrero de 2013). En otra oportunidad, declaró: “...Me ofende que Ud. invente lo de los intereses económicos... ¿Cómo voy a hacer algo que está prohibido por las Naciones Unidas?...porque hay sanciones económicas impuestas por las Naciones Unidas, de las cuales Argentina es suscripta, que impiden el comercio con Irán más allá del que se está realizando, que es en granos, y eso no lo hace el gobierno argentino....lo hacen las empresas privadas...” (Tenembaum, Ernesto, Tierra de Locos, entrevista a Héctor Timerman, 18/2/13). Más allá de que lo afirmado no es cierto y contradice otras declaraciones públicas del propio Timerman, estas manifestaciones se dan de bruces con la prueba directa que aquí se presenta, donde se constató que el Poder Ejecutivo integrado por el canciller Timerman negociaba secretamente con Irán la compra petróleo y la venta de carne y granos, y además, cabe señalar que de esas tratativas participó uno de los prófugos de la causa AMIA: Mohsen Rabbani. Ejemplo de ello corresponde mencionar la comunicación interceptada en mayo de 2013, de la que intervino Rabbani, a quién se le informó: “...hoyparticipamos de una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPFpara arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas ...bueno es cuestión de verlo”, a lo que Rabbani respondió: mándeme para que evalúe”. Luego de evaluarlo, Rabbani contestó: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina, vender tractores...y también comprar armas...'” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31 y del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Mientras la justicia argentina bregaba por lograr la detención de los acusados por el atentado para poder someterlos a un juicio justo y mientras los familiares y sobrevivientes aguardaban con ilusión la llegada de ese momento, el canciller Timerman y la Presidente Fernández mantuvieron negociaciones secretas con uno de los prófugos buscados y, en simultáneo, se ufanaban públicamente de estar colaborando para el avance de la causa. Otra contribución a la maniobra delictiva denunciada se advirtió en el rol que desempeñó Timerman en relación a la puesta en escena en la que se pretendió engañar a la opinión pública sobre aspectos relativos al acuerdo. Fue Timerman quien comunicó que la reunión con su par iraní nacía de un pedido de Teherán, en respuesta al discurso presidencial ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, cuando -en realidad- se comprobó que “...la reunión se hace de apuro a pedido de Cristina...” (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161). Y fue Timerman quien, sin la compañía de su par, comunicó la aprobación interna del acuerdo por las autoridades iraníes, es decir, un acto de gobierno del régimen iraní. Resumiendo, quien debería velar por los intereses de todos los argentinos en materia de relaciones exteriores, se encuentra involucrado en la ejecución de un ominoso plan de encubrimiento ideado, planificado e instrumentado para dotar de impunidad a los acusados iraníes por el caso AMIA y desvincularlos de forma definitiva de la investigación por el atentado. En esta tarea, ha faltado a sus deberes de funcionario público, conforme lo requiere el alto cargo ministerial que ostenta y lo exige la Ley de Ministerios de la Nación; ha infringido la ley penal, incurriendo en múltiples conductas delictivas; ha avasallado la actuación de la justicia argentina de los últimos ocho años, efectuando concesiones que echan por tierra los logros obtenidos en el marco de una causa sumamente compleja; ha engañado y mentido a dirigentes comunitarios, a las agrupaciones de familiares de víctimas del atentado, a los sobrevivientes, a legisladores nacionales, a la prensa y a la sociedad argentina toda, no dudando en tergiversar la realidad, con el objeto de ocultar el plan criminal del que participó. Estas conductas merecen el máximo reproche y la aplicación rigurosa de las leyes que han sido violadas. a)	Luis Angel D'Elía Luis D'Elía ha sido el interlocutor válido del que se han servido la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller para mantener activas las negociaciones secretas y clandestinas con Irán en relación al plan de encubrimiento. Esto no puede sorprender a nadie pues ha sido a lo largo de muchos años, y continúa siendo aún hoy, un encendido defensor del régimen iraní, que ha reproducido en los medios vernáculos, la versión históricamente sostenida por las autoridades iraníes, cuestionando la acusación judicial que pesa sobre sus nacionales por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, a quienes ha defendido públicamente en reiteradas oportunidades. Tiene probadas y estrechas relaciones con autoridades de la República Islámica de Irán, con quienes se contacta y ha compartido entrevistas radiales, viajes, conferencias, actos políticos, etc. Ello sentó las bases para que haya sido invitado a Irán en más de una ocasión, además de haber realizado otros viajes gracias al auspicio y apoyo de sus amistades persas, como, por ejemplo, su visita a la República del Líbano en 2012. (Obarrio, Mariano, “D'Elía prometió acercarse más a Irán”, La Nación, 28/02/2007; “D'Elía, más lejos: Irán no tiene nada que ver con el atentado a la AMIA”, Perfil, 7/3/2010; Oz, Fernando, “D'Elía lleva negocios a Irán y ya sueña con enriquecerle uranio”, Perfil, 3/4/2010; “D'Elía gestiona negocios para Irán y busca que la Argentina colabore en su polémico programa nuclear”, Infobae, 4/4/2010; “Desde el Líbano, D'Elía volvió a agredir a la comunidad judía”, Radio JAI, 29/03/2012; “D'Elía marchó por Palestina y desató polémica en Twitter”, Perfil, 29/03/2012). De hecho, a fines de febrero y principios de marzo de 2007, Luís D'Elía viajó a la República Islámica de Irán y se reunió, al menos, con dos de los imputados por el atentado contra la AMIA: Mohsen Rabbani y Ahmad Asghari, circunstancia que él mismo reconoció bajo juramento al prestar declaración testimonial ante el suscripto. En esa ocasión, también admitió que el viaje no había sido abonado de su peculio, sino que fue una invitación a participar de un seminario sobre América Latina y que “como en cualquier seminario internacional los gastos fueron abonados por el r país que invita” (declaración testimonial de Luis Angel D'Elía de fecha 08/05/2007, fs. 124.367/124.373 de los autos principales, fs. 17/23 del Legajo N°416). A su regreso de la nación asiática, D'Elía refirió que le habían entregado evidencias y documentación que demostraban que Irán no había tenido nada que ver con el atentado contra la AMIA y que la acusación de esta Unidad Fiscal estaba apoyaba en pruebas falsas (Obarrio, Mariano, “D'Elía prometió acercarse más a Irán”, La Nación, 28/02/2007; Galak, Oliver, “Escándalo en la Feria del Libro”, La Nación, 30/04/2007; “De regreso, D'Elía ratificó su respaldo a Irán”, La Nación, 2/3/2007). Consecuentemente, se sustanció una exhaustiva investigación siguiendo la información, los elementos y los testigos aportados por D'Elía. Inicialmente, D'Elía relativizó los trascendidos de la prensa, al explicar que las suyas no eran afirmaciones categóricas, sino que se trataba de una mera hipótesis elaborada en virtud de los elementos que le proveyeron en Irán y el consejo de sus abogados. La debilidad de sus argumentos quedó manifiesta cuando, al ser citado en declaración testimonial, D’Elía nada pudo corroborar ni aportar elemento alguno que diera apoyo a sus especulaciones. Incluso admitió no haber leído nunca el expediente y reconoció que sus afirmaciones no eran tales, sino meras especulaciones. De hecho, las mismas fueron desestimadas hasta por sus propios testigos. A fin de cuentas quedó claramente comprobado que la versión brindada por D'Elía no encontraba apoyo, ni siquiera, en los elementos y medidas de prueba que él mismo había propuesto. Y, en consecuencia, se dio por finalizada esa línea de investigación, concluyéndose que “la versión esbozada por Luis D'Elía, huérfana de todo sustento, queda reducida a una teoría disparatada y antojadiza que cae por su propio peso y no amerita un mayor análisis” (fs. 379/381 del Legajo 416). En concreto, en aquella ocasión quedó desvirtuado lo que podría interpretarse como un intento, burdo por cierto, de desincriminar a los imputados iraníes de toda participación en el atentado contra la AMIA en el que también estuvo involucrado Luis D'Elía. No ha de extrañar entonces que nuevas maniobras destinadas a desvincular a los acusados iraníes de las imputaciones que se les formulan en la causa por el atentado vuelvan a tener al Sr. D’Elía como protagonista. Es más, su cercanía al gobierno de Cristina Fernández y sus lazos con Irán lo convirtieron en un personaje casi imprescindible en esta trama delictiva. Cabe recordar que D'Elía llegó calificarse a sí mismo como “un soldado” incondicional de la Presidente. En los meses de febrero y marzo de 2010, Luis D’Elía volvió a visitar Irán. Esta vez lo hizo acompañado de Alicia Sánchez, Fernando Esteche, Jorge Rachid, Mario Codarín y Abdul Karim Paz (Santiago Paz Bullrich). La visita tuvo por objeto participar del 31° aniversario de la Revolución Islámica y fue una invitación del gobierno iraní, que alojó a toda la comitiva en la Casa de Huéspedes de la cancillería persa (“Quejas de Israel por el viaje de D'Elia a Irán”, La Nación, 07/03/2010; “D'Elía admitió un encuentro con un ex funcionario iraní prófugo en la causa AMIA”, La Prensa, 07/03/2010; “D’Elía y Esteche vieron en Irán a un sospechoso de volar la AMIA”, Perfil, 06/03/2010). Fue en esta ocasión, en la que los iraníes le ofrecieron un acuerdo de similares características al que terminó firmando Héctor Timerman. “...Es parecido a lo que nos propusieron en el primer viaje a Teherán ¿te acordás(Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado N°11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27- 174637-12, CD 266). En aquella oportunidad, D'Elía volvió a reunirse con Mohsen Rabbani. Esta vez, con la participación de Fernando Esteche y de Abdul Karim Paz, entre otros (“D'Elía admitió un encuentro con un ex funcionario iraní prófugo en la causa AMIA”, La Prensa, 07/03/2010; “D’Elía y Esteche vieron en Irán a un sospechoso de volar la AMIA”, Perfil, 06/03/2010; “D'Elía sigue defendiendo al prófugo de la AMIA: Es una buena persona”, Clarín, 09/03/2010; “Diputados repudió el viaje de D’Elía a Irán y pidió informes a Cancillería”, Infobae, 07/04/2010). Durante años, como se adelantó, D’Elía ha mantenido un estrecho contacto con Mohsen Rabbani, con quien se reunió en todas las ocasiones en que fue invitado a la República Islámica de Irán y a quien entrevistó en más de una oportunidad en su radio, en exclusiva, cuando Rabbani ya estaba prófugo (entrevistas radiales de Luis D'Elía a Mohsen Rabbani de fechas 9/3/2010 y 6/4/2011, “Siete punto cero”, Radio Cooperativa AM 770; “D'Elía y Esteche vieron en Irán a un sospechoso del atentado a la AMIA”, Perfil, 6/03/2010; “D'Elía, más lejos: Irán no tiene nada que ver con el atentado a la AMIA”, Perfil, 7/3/2010; “D'Elía no cometió delito al reunirse con los iraníes”, Crítica, 8/3/2010; “Rabbani le r confirmó a D'Elía que no declarará en la causa AMIA”, Ambito Financiero, 9/3/2010; Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, “D'Elía sigue defendiendo al prófugo de la AMIA: es una buena persona”, Clarín, 9/3/2010; “Rabbani advirtió que hay muchos negocios atrás de la causa AMIA”, Página 12, 9/3/2010; Oz, Fernando, “D'Elía lleva negocios a Irán y ya sueña con enriquecerle uranio”, Perfil, 3/4/2010; “D'Elía gestiona negocios para Irán y busca que la Argentina colabore en su polémico programa nuclear”, Infobae, 4/4/2010). Esta invitación a la República Islámica de Irán no fue casual. Lo invitaron para ir adelantándole la solución política y la desvinculación del tema AMIA y así dejar de lado las acusaciones de la justicia argentina y -fundamentalmente- la baja de las notificaciones rojas, en línea con lo históricamente postulado por Teherán. En su entorno, se destacan figuras como el ex embajador venezolano en Argentina, Roger Capella. Durante su estadía en Argentina, el Embajador Roger Capella trabó una aceitada relación con distintas agrupaciones sociales argentinas, financiando a referentes como Luis D'Elía y Fernando Esteche con viajes, becas y otros recursos. (Gallo, Daniel, “Controvertida agenda política del Embajador de Venezuela”, La Nación, 16/11/2006). Cabe recordar además que Capella fue quien en noviembre de 2006 incitó a Luis D'Elía a realizar la protesta en contra de la justicia argentina por el caso AMIA, que le costó su espacio en el gobierno de Kirchner (“Kirchner ordenó expulsar a D'Elía del gobierno”, La Nación, 14/11/2006; Gallo, Daniel, “Controvertida agenda política del Embajador de Venezuela”, La Nación 16/11/2006). Ahora bien, la consustanciación de D'Elía con el régimen iraní motivó que siguiera las pautas de la estrategia comunicacional orquestada desde Teherán y que haya sido fuertemente crítico con la investigación llevada a cabo por las autoridades judiciales argentinas y con sus funcionarios, cuestionando su integridad y argumentando que la acusación contra los nacionales iraníes es falsa y ha sido inventada por intereses, presiones e interferencias de sectores y agencias norteamericanas e israelíes (Ver Comunicado del 13 de noviembre de 2006, firmado por Luis D'Elía y Juan José Cantiello, entregado al entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Buenos Aires, Mohsen Baharvand; Wiñazki, Verónica, “Desde Irán, D'Elía aseguró que apoyaría la pena de muerte a los responsables de la AMIA”, Perfil, 4/3/2010; “D'Elía, más lejos: Irán no tiene nada que ver con   Ministerio Público de la Nación el atentado a la AMIA”, Perfil, 7/3/2010; “D'Elía no cometió delito al reunirse con los iraníes”, Crítica, 8/3/2010; Entrevista en el programa “DATA” de Rodolfo Barili, Canal Metro, 27/03/2010; “Causa AMIA: Para D'Elía, los acusados iraníes van a ser sobreseídos”, Infobae, 1/3/2013; Discurso de Luis D'Elía en el Acto por el Día Internacional del Al Quds o Día Internacional de la solidaridad iraní por la liberación de Palestina, Mezquita At-Tauhid, 2/8/2013; “D'Elía satisfecho tras el giro de Cristina con Irán, insiste con defender a los acusados por AMIA”, La Nación, 26/09/2012; Dinatale, Martín. “D'Elía y Esteche reivindicaron a la agrupación terrorista Hezbollah”, La Nación, 13/08/2013). Tal postura pública le costó, como ya se expuso, su cargo como Subsecretario Nacional de Tierras para el Hábitat Social. En relación a aquel distanciamiento, el propio D'Elía declaró: “...fue un momento muy duro para mí... ”, pero aclaró: “...nunca me fui del kirchnerismo, seguí militando y acompañando como lo hice siempre....'” (“Causa AMIA: Para D'Elía, los acusados iraníes van a ser sobreseídos”, Infobae, 1/3/2013). Sin embargo, más allá de haber dejado la función pública, D'Elía siguió muy vinculado al gobierno, actuando desde la Federación de Tierras y Viviendas. Mantuvo su cuota de poder dentro de la estructura gubernamental nacional y preservó sus contactos, lo que le permitió seguir operando. Su actividad pareció desplegar mayor intensidad y/o visibilidad durante el último mandato de Cristina Fernández. Su injerencia en la cuestión de tierras y viviendas se ve corroborada, por ejemplo, en las palabras de Jorge Khalil quien, hablando con otro miembro de la comunidad iraní local, afirmó: “Recién salgo de donde Luis...le pedí hectáreas para nosotros, me las va a dar ahora...para hacer un predio para nosotros....” (Comunicación del 13/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-13-124515-18, CD 283). Y en otra ocasión le refirió a D'Elía: “...yo ya te había dicho que yo fui ahí a Corrientes, a la subsecretaría, a que avances con esos... ”, en alusión a negocios previos entre ambos (Comunicación del 5/3/2013, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-03-05-231220-24.wav, CD 303). Es decir, que aun fuera de la función oficial, D'Elía ha seguido moviendo los hilos en la Subsecretaría Nacional de Tierras, operando y disponiendo de predios del Estado, como si continuase ejerciendo la función pública de facto. Al respecto, cabe recordar que en el año 2008 la ex Subsecretaría de Tierras para el Hábitat Social que había dependido de Luis D'Elía en el año 2006, pasó a llamarse Comisión Nacional de Tierras para el Hábitat Social “Padre Carlos Mujica” y a depender de la Jefatura de Gabinete de Ministros de Presidencia de la Nación (Decretos N° 172/2006 del 20/02/2006 y 341/2008 del 3/3/2008). La citada comisión tiene su sede en Av. Corrientes 1302 piso 2do. de la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires y hace años se encuentra presidida por el Arquitecto Rubén Pascolini quien, a su vez, y junto con la gran mayoría de los directivos de dicha comisión, es miembro de la asociación civil “Federación de Tierra, Vivienda y Hábitat” que preside, justamente, Luis D'Elía (sitios oficiales: www.tierras.gob.ar y www.ftv.org.ar). Resumiendo. Pocas personas pueden acreditar tantas credenciales como Luis Ángel D’Elía para desempeñar el rol aquí denunciado. Ha sido un acérrimo defensor del régimen iraní y del gobierno nacional al punto de calificarse a sí mismo como “un soldado”. Así lo reconoció el propio D'Elía en una conversación con Khalil, en oportunidad en la que viajó a Venezuela con Cristina Fernández, a causa del fallecimiento de Presidente Hugo Chávez. En esa ocasión, expresó: “Yo me estoy yendo a Caracas temprano...Me voy con la Presidenta, Yuse...”. Luego, en relación a su ausencia en la conmemoración por la muerte de Chávez, ocurrida en la Embajada Venezolana en Buenos Aires, agregó: “Yo tengo que hacer el juego de la Rosada, papá. Si tengo orden de no ir, soy un soldado acá, ¿entendés?” (Comunicación del 05/03/2013, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-03-05-231220-24.wav, CD 303). Efectivamente: un soldado, que viaja como parte de la comitiva presidencial para acompañar a la Sra. Presidente en su visita de condolencia por el fallecimiento de un mandatario extranjero. Ahora bien, no puede extrañar que, con estas credenciales y decidido el acercamiento con Teherán -en función del plan criminal aquí expuesto-, haya desempeñado un rol fundamental como nexo, recibiendo y enviando mensajes secretos de las autoridades argentinas a Teherán, en distintas etapas de este sofisticado plan. Esto se verificó cuando el acuerdo aun se estaba negociando, luego de haberse firmado el memorando, cuando éste quedó trabado por el desinterés de Irán y cuando se montó una puesta en escena para simular una salida dialogada a las desaveniencias surgidas. Incluso, ha sido partícipe de las negociaciones comerciales ligadas al plan, que involucraron al imputado Mohsen Rabbani. No pueden interpretarse de otro modo los constantes contactos telefónicos y personales que ha tenido con Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, un pilar de la comunidad iraní en Buenos Aires y la voz más alta de Irán en Argentina en todo lo concerniente al tema AMIA; las reuniones que ha mantenido con el Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina; su participación en la digitación de las actividades de grupos locales de apoyo a Irán; la “regulación” de sus apariciones y declaración públicas por parte del entorno presidencial y el asiduo contacto con el Diputado Andrés Larroque, quien opera como su principal -aunque no única- vía de contacto con la Sra. Presidente. Cabe recordar que la intermediación de Larroque entre Cristina y D’Elía quedó evidenciada ante la opinión pública en general cuando se publicó que el Diputado le había transmitido a D'Elía el siguiente mensaje: “Dice Cristina que no hables más hasta las elecciones” (“Cristina furiosa con D'Elía: No hables más hasta las elecciones”, La Política On Line, 26/9/2013). Esta información periodística se condice en un todo con los datos que surgen de las conversaciones telefónicas registradas, en tanto corroboran que Larroque es el intermediario entre la Dra. Fernández y D'Elía y que a través suyo ha entrado y salido la información al despacho presidencial, al menos en varios episodios relacionados con los hechos aquí denunciados. En este sentido, corresponde repetir que Luis D’Elía no es una persona simplemente alineada con Cristina Fernández por mera afinidad en relación al caso AMIA, sino que se trata de uno de sus operadores, alguien que trabaja para sus intereses, al que se le imparten instrucciones y que responde sin cuestionamientos. No se eligió a cualquiera como intermediario para avanzar en la negociación con Irán, eligieron a un “soldado”. A continuación, se expondrán distintos episodios que permiten ejemplificar el rol de Luis D'Elía en este entramado. Primero, corresponde reiterar las palabras de Jorge Khalil en noviembre de 2012: “...vengo de La Matanza recién he tenido una reunión con Luis D’Elía y el “Cuervo” Larroque, el de la Cámpora...que me llamaron temprano que querían hablar conmigo, que tenían un mensaje para el gobierno para dar... Y ahora me voy para Martínez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador...”, en referencia al Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, máxima autoridad oficial en territorio nacional (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-17-104846-10.wav, CD 195). Y al día siguiente: “...Me fui a La Matanza, estuve hablando con el Cuerno Larroque y con D'Elía...de ahí me tuve que ir a la casa del embajador a hablar con el embajador para mandar un mensaje que me mandaron...” (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18- 100116-6, CD 196). Segundo. El día 27 de enero de 2013, luego de que el canciller Timerman firmara el pacto con Irán, el entonces Secretario General de la Presidencia, Oscar Parrilli, se comunicó con Luis D'Elía para informarle esa circunstancia y, además, le pidió que por unos diez días mantenga un perfil bajo y no realice declaraciones públicas (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado N°11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-174637-12, CD 266 y Comunicación del 28/01/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2013-01-28-135905-20, CD 267). Si Luis D’Elía no formase parte del grupo que ejecutó el encubrimiento, esta comunicación carecería de todo I.BEWTO i ISCAL GENEíiAL sentido pues no siendo funcionario del gobierno ¿cuál sería el motivo para informarlo al instante de la firma del acuerdo y la razón para pedirle que mantenga silencio? Idéntico pedido de “silencio estratégico” le fue comunicado por “Alian”, pero esa vez por intermedio de Jorge Khalil: “...lo que le tenés que decir al negro...que esté tranquilo, 'por diez días no comentés nada'... ”. Y Khalil se lo transmitió a D'Elía: “...por las dudas que te llamen hoy los medios o alguno, tené perfil bajo, por diez días por lo menos... ”, a lo que éste respondió: “...bárbaro....me dijo Parrilli recién también. Dale...” (Comunicación del 28/01/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28- 135905-20, CD 267). Es forzoso concluir que la Dra. Fernández hizo llegar a D'Elía su indicación de “silencio estratégico”, tanto a través del Secretario General como de “Alian”. Y resulta una terrible paradoja que las autoridades del gobierno nacional se ocupen de informar personalmente a Luis D’Elía de la firma del Memorando mientras que tanto los familiares y víctimas del atentado como la dirigencia comunitaria hayan tenido que anoticiarse por los medios de comunicación. Tercero. En febrero de 2013, D'Elía le consiguió al entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán, Alí Pakdaman, la posibilidad de publicar una nota en la agencia oficial de noticias: “...en Télam, yo se la conseguí...él me llamó a mí para decirme que quería salir en Télam...y me llamó Baharvandpara decirme lo mismo...”, en referencia al diplomático iraní y anterior Encargado de Negocios apostado en Buenos Aires (Comunicación del 12/02/2013, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-12-185834-30, CD 282). De hecho, para articular ese pedido de la diplomacia iraní, D’Elía recurrió a sus contactos en el gobierno: “...yo se la conseguí, yo hablé con Rodra y el Cuervo...”, en alusión al entonces Subsecretario de Medios Rodrigo Rodríguez y al Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque (Comunicación del 12/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-12-185834-30, CD 282). Este tipo de episodios demuestran, una vez más, que las acciones de Luis D'Elía se encuentran destinadas a responder y atender a los intereses iraníes, en cumplimiento de las directivas emanadas de Presidencia de la Nación. Cuarto. En el acto del Día de Al Quds, Luis D'Elía reivindicó a Hezbollah y se jactó de sus contactos con la organización terrorista acusada de ejecutar el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA (Dinatale, Martín, “D'Elía y Esteche reivindicaron a la agrupación terrorista Hezbollah”, La Nación, 13/08/2013). Al elogiar a la organización terrorista libanesa, hizo referencia a su reciente viaje a la República del Líbano en marzo de 2012, donde visitó sitios propios de la organización y estuvo en contacto sus dirigentes (Discurso de Luis D'Elía en el Acto por el Día Internacional de Al Quds, Mezquita At-Tauhid, 02/08/2013). Según la información disponible, este viaje habría sido solventado por la organización “Free Palestiné’ (“Luis D'Elía desde Beirut, acompaña la Marcha Mundial a Jerusalén por Palestina. En Buenos Aires, se marchará desde el Obelisco, en www.luisdelia.org, 30/03/2012). Además, D'Elía le agradeció a los referentes de Irán en Argentina “...la posibilidad de conocer el Líbano...de estar en contacto con los dirigentes de Hezbollah...” (Discurso de Luis D'Elía en el Acto por el Día Internacional de Al Quds, Mezquita At-Tauhid, 02/08/2013). Sus declaraciones dejan en evidencia las intenciones de sus contactos iraníes al solventar dicha visita. Su militancia a favor de la referida organización terrorista llegó al punto de solicitarle a Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, que le facilite contactos con dirigentes de Hamas y Hezbollah, por razones periodísticas. En sus palabras, le pidió “...que le habilites contactos allá con Hezbollah y Hamas...”, aludiendo -justamente- a Hezbollah, cuyo involucramiento en el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA ha sido revelado por numerosos elementos probatorios en el marco de la causa (Comunicación del 24/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11 -24-134118- 12, CD 202). Quinto. Fue el encargado de transmitir la “desazón” de la República Islámica de Irán por el fracaso argentino en el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Ello surge explícito de la prueba obtenida y aquí detallada. Khalil: Yyyyy...hay un poquito de....esto entre nosotros, hay un poquito de desazón de allá, de allá, no sé porque, hay desazón. D’Elía: ¿¡Desazón!? Khalil: Desazón, sí, sí, sí. No gustó algunas palabras que se dijeron eh, me parece... D’Elía: Ajá Khalil: Me parece que el ruso este de mierda'9 se mandó alguna. D’Elía: Ah ¿sil Khalil: Si, sí D’Elía: ¿Qué dijo? Khalil: No... estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares  también parece, pero bueno lo hablamos personalmente. D’Elía: Bueno, dale, dale, dale. (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	05-11-083146-8.wav, CD 0022). Sexto. Luis D’Elía conocía perfectamente que uno de los intereses de las autoridades del gobierno argentino que había motivado la ejecución del plan de encubrimiento del que participó, ha sido principalmente comercial. Recuérdese la secuencia de comunicaciones mantenidas con Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil el día 20 de mayo de 2013. D’Elía: Estoy acá en la puerta de Planificación y entro a ver a Julio eh! Khalil: Bueno, bueno, 11ámame después. D’Elía: Le voy a tirar eso, eh, ¿dale? Khalil: Dale, si, si tranquilo. Transcurrida la reunión entre Luis D’Elía y el Ministro Julio De Vido, el primero volvió a comunicarse con Khalil: D’Elía: Bueno, mirá, acá estuve hablando con el ‘quía' Khalil: sí D’Elía: Ellos están dispuestos a mandar la gente de YPF con nosotros dos Khalil: si D’Elía: A hacer negocios allá. Khalil: Bien. D’Elía: Está muy interesado en intercambiar lo de aquellos por granos y carne allá eh. Khalil: Bueno. D’Elía: Y... ¿cómo es? Tiene un problema político, necesitan que se apruebe el memorándum ¿sí? Khalil: Y si, está clarito ese tema Luis...yo te lo dije el otro día, ¿Manifestaste lo que te dije? D’Elía: Si, yo les dije hace 10 días y me dijeron que en 30 días se aprobaba Khalil: No, no, yo te dije que el memorándum se iba a aprobar ...yo te lo dije a vos, pero que lo estaban retrasando por esa cuestión... D’Elía: No...no, ahí hubo alguna....conté lo que vos me contaste, el incidente que hubo Khalil: Si D’Elía: Y...la reunión fue porque lo pidió la jefa ¡eh! Khalil: Bueno. D’Elía: Estamos al más alto nivel. Khalil: quiere decir que estamos bien. D’Elía: Si, si, re bien	ahora, si a nosotros no nos aprueban el memo ese, quedamos como unos pelotudos allá ¿viste? Khalil: ¿Si no lo aprueban? Lo van a aprobar, eso lo van a aprobar... D’Elía: Bueno, pero a la brevedad lo tienen que aprobar, viste. Khalil: Lo van a aprobar Luis, vos sabés cómo son los tiempos en Persia y aparte la lógicas que no se cumplen, o sea....eehh...De Vido tiene que saber que “Timerman no cumplió con algunas cosas ”, esto es así de claro, no cumplió con algunas cosas... (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	05-20-111124-8, CD31). Los pormenores de esa reunión, que D'Elía transmitió a Jorge Khalil, llegaron ese mismo día a Teherán, cuando el referente local de Irán resumió: “...Acá hay luz verde para hacer las operaciones y mandar a la gente, el tema es que quieren que se apure el memorándum...En principio, deciles que el tema que necesita Argentina es petróleo, todo petróleo, y todo lo que está comprando...Irán en grano se lo pueden dar, ese petróleo a cambio de granos... ¿entendés?...y se habló con De Vido...que todo esto se habló con De Vido...Argentina tiene una gran necesidad de petróleo e Irán tiene una gran necesidad de granos y todo eso, empezar el intercambio. Eso por un lado. Por el otro lado, De Vido entiende que para dar un paso en esto...o sea oficial, de Estado a Estado, tiene que haber firma del memorándum, porque si no, siguen los privados, nada más ...como están ¡aburando...O sea, que se firme primero el memorándum para empezar a hacerlo de Estado a Estado, porque por ahora los únicos que están trabajando son los privados...” (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11 -3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-133130-8, CD 31). Séptimo. D’Elía ha jugado un rol fundamental en la “puesta en escena” articulada por las autoridades del gobierno argentino a finales del mes de septiembre de 2013 cuando, supuestamente, se esperaba que la República Islámica de Irán responda si el Memorando había sido aprobado o no por el régimen. La realidad de lo que ocurría está plasmada en las conversaciones telefónicas entre D’Elía y Khalil. 27 de septiembre de 2013. D’Elía: ...tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar allá, pero urgente, antes de mañana. Khalil: ¿Antes de mañana? ¿Dónde estás? D’Elía: Estoy en la casa de gobierno ahora. Khalil: Bueno, voy para aquellos lados. (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-103753-14, CD 161). En consecuencia, Khalil intentó ubicar al Encargado de Negocios iraní en Argentina para transmitirle el mensaje. Khalil: Escúchame, Mohsen, ¿el hombre este va a estar ahí? Mohsen Ali: El hombre va a estar ahí, pero tiene dos reuniones... Khalil: No, yo necesito sacarlo 15 minutos, necesito darle un mensaje, viejo. Mohsen Ali: Y por eso, pero ¿Cuándo? Khalil: Es del gobierno argentino, mandaron un mensaje para él. (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-104209-26, CD 161) En la siguiente comunicación se dijo: Mohsen Ali: Escúchame, dice el Embajador que prefiere verte a vos solo, porque te quiere hablar, no vengas con él, que venga más tarde. Khalil: No, yo puedo ir antes, el mensaje lo tiene él. Mohsen Alí: Antes... Khalil: Me llamó recién, llamaron de casa de gobierno, lo tiene él, el mensaje. Mohsen Ali: Claro, claro, pero dice que a vos te quiere ver para hablarte en privado. (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-104852-14.wav, CD 161). En definitiva, D'Elía fue a la Embajada de Irán y le pidió a Khalil que también transmitiera el mensaje directamente a Irán: quería que llegara personalmente a Mohsen Rabbani. D’Elía: Estoy en camino a la Embajada Yussef. Khalil: Está bien, andá tranquilo, yo llegué justo recién a Casa Rosada, andá tranquilo. D’Elía: Escúchame, veníporque necesito que hables con el Sheik alia ehl Khalil: Si, sí, sí, estoy con Rubén, ya llamamos al otro.  FISCAL  Ministerio Público de la Nación D’Elía: aaahh, ¿estás con Rubén? Me quedo tranquilo. Khalil: estoy con Rubén acá, estoy enterado de todo, quedate tranquilo. D’Elía: decile que....explícale que acá estamos [ininteligible] y necesitamos eso, ¿sabésl Khalil: listo, listo, listo. D’Elía: que mañana lo anuncien los dos eh... ¿tá? Khalil: Listo, listo, dale, abrazo. D’Elía: Listo, chau, abrazo. (Comunicaciones del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	09-27-114113-28, CD 161). En una posterior comunicación Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil reveló el mensaje. Khalil: Hola, ¿te digo lo que es? Karim Paz: Si. Khalil: Necesita que el gobierno iraní junto con el gobierno argentino mañana anuncie la conformación de la Comisión de la Verdad. Karim Paz: ajá... Khalil: Y...y eso. Que por favor lo anuncien en conjunto mañana en la reunión. Karim Paz: Hay que ver si los iraníes están preparados tan rápido, hay que ver... Khalil: No....yo que sé, eso es otro tema, yo te digo lo que quieren. Karim Paz: No sé, me parece que hicieron medio boludeces pero igual los iraníes tienen una paciencia de elefante, así que se la van a bancar. Khalil: Si, por eso. Karim Paz: ....quieren arreglar Khalil: Tranquilo. Karim Paz: Pero parece desprolijo, la Argentina se mueve ¿viste?, chupándole las medias a Estados Unidos, tiran problemas para Estados Unidos, pero se la van.... igual se la van a bancar todo, pero no creo que ya mañana anuncien que ya confirmaron. No creo que los iraníes vengan tan afilados de reunión, porque la reunión se hace de apuro a pedido de Cristina.... (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-115448-6, CD 161). En este punto, corresponde destacar el rol fundamental de D’Elía, al tratarse de la persona de la que se ha valido la Sra. Presidente y demás integrantes del plan criminal para transmitir los mensajes relativos a encaminar el encubrimiento destinado a dotar de impunidad a los acusados iraníes. En síntesis, los antecedentes de Luis D’Elía como acérrimo defensor y militante tanto del régimen iraní como del gobierno nacional lo han posicionado como la persona ideal para cumplir este plan de encubrimiento. Ya participaba del plan cuando el acuerdo aún se estaba negociando, cuando se firmó el Memorando de Entendimiento, cuando se lo trató en el Congreso Nacional, cuando quedó trabado por el desinterés de Irán, y cuando se montó una actuación entre las partes para simular que intentaban diplomáticamente acordar una salida dialogada a las desavenencias surgidas. En distintas instancias de este sofisticado delito ha realizado aportes fundamentales para su desarrollo. Recibió instrucciones de parte de Andrés Larroque. Se comunicó innumerables veces con el interlocutor del régimen iraní, Jorge Khalil, contactó al representante diplomático de Irán y abogó públicamente por la buena marcha del plan. Es decir, desde su posición, contribuyó constantemente al avance del delito. d)	Jorge Alejandro ""Yussuf"" Khalil Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil es el referente más importante de las autoridades del régimen iraní en Argentina. En ese carácter ha sido el nexo central en la vinculación entre autoridades iraníes y argentinas en el marco del accionar delictivo aquí denunciado. De hecho, en todo aquello relacionado con el plan de encubrimiento, Khalil ha contado con mucho más peso específico que los diplomáticos persas aquí apostados. Es decir, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil responde al régimen y ha actuado en todo momento conforme las directivas de Teherán. Ha sido la voz y los oídos de Irán en Argentina, ha transmitido los mensajes de sus autoridades y ha defendido los intereses iraníes ante los operadores locales y, al mismo tiempo, ha retransmitido las inquietudes y demandas de las autoridades argentinas a sus superiores en Irán. Khalil siempre fue consciente de su posición y la explicó manifestando: “yo soy orgánico le dije...a mí me dieron la orden de allá, no tengo que mover un dedo...no muevo un dedo” en alusión a que obedece enteramente a las indicaciones y directivas que recibe de Teherán (Comunicación del 6/6/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 06-06-092046-14, CD 48). Khalil es visto en la comunidad como “...el interlocutor ante la Embajada...” y así lo describió él mismo (Comunicación del 14/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-14-164341-10, CD 284). En otra ocasión se definió como el nexo entre funcionarios argentinos y la Embajada de Irán, al aclarar: “yo no estoy operando para ellos, yo estoy operando para los nuestros, para lo que es la embajada...ellos me mandaron a hacer una cosa, yo como soy el nexo...”, en clara referencia a Irán (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11 -18-100116-6, CD 196). Por si queda alguna duda sobre la importancia de Khalil como referente y nexo local para Teherán, en especial para este plan de impunidad, él mismo demostró su manejo y aclaró que no le importaba lo que dijera el entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, máxima autoridad diplomática iraní en el país, Ali Pakdaman. En sus palabras: “...me chupa un huevo Pakdaman...” (Comunicación del 12/08/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-08-12-120458- 26, CD 115). Sin embargo, cabe aclarar que Khalil varía notablemente su modo de acoplarse a la actividad diplomática iraní de acuerdo al tema que esté tratándose, comportándose por momentos sumiso y en ocasiones desafiante y autónomo, lo que demuestra el significativo grado de independencia de sus canales de contacto y, fundamentalmente, de su respaldo en Teherán. Entre otros, se apoya en Mohsen Baharvand, antiguo Encargado de Negocios iraní en Argentina y actualmente encumbrado funcionario de la cancillería persa. Al respecto, ha dicho: “Baha sabe cómo me muevo y todo...qué lugares frecuento, él sabe todo, yo le cuento, le conté todo a él siempre”, en contraposición con la postura que asumió con uno de sus sucesores, Ali Pakdaman, sobre quien expresó: “...yo no se lo voy a decir al Safir, porque el Safir va y lo vende...” (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-04-130024-6, CD 182). A días de firmarse el acuerdo con Irán, Pakdaman lo convocó para decirle: “...usted tiene que ir a Irán porque Baharvand le quiere informar cómo van las cosas, cómo van a seguir...y aparte el sheik [por Mohsen Rabbani] va a decir delante de todos que todos lo sigan a usted...”, lo que demuestra tanto su estrecha vinculación con la diplomacia iraní como -fundamentalmente- la confianza y cercanía con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani (Comunicación del 14/02/2013, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341 -10, CD 284). Pero más allá de ciertas tensiones, queda claro que Khalil es autónomo y con poder propio respecto de la diplomacia formal iraní, a la cual elude según sus instrucciones, “....yo lo puenteé porque a mí me dijeron que yo tengo que hacer las cosas y bueno...las hago. Aparte hablé con el jefe de él, si tiene algún problema que se lo diga al jefe de éT (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-133130-8, CD31) Tampoco resulta ocioso agregar que el actual Encargado de Negocios iraní en Argentina consiguió su cargo gracias a la gestión y venia del propio Khalil, quién lo confesó expresando: “...el embajador quedó muy contento, es un embajador que eh...yo lo veo muy potable de todos los embajadores que vinieron, yo con el que mejor trabajo es éste...es un embajador que elegí. Cuando a mí me preguntaron ¿fulano, mengano o zutano? Dije fulano y yo se lo dije a este embajador ¿usted sabe que le puse yo el dedo a usted? Me dice si, si, si, yo le quiero agradecer porque habló por mí, que esto que lo otro. Porque el jefe de él, era íntimo amigo mío, es íntimo amigo mío y la verdad que es el que está llevando las negociaciones con argentina” (Comunicación del 29/11/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-11 -29-131946-2, CD 224). A mayor abundamiento, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil considera al actual Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, un “amigo” (Comunicación del 4/7/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-07-04-004323-8, CD 76), lo que se evidencia en ciertos gestos, por ejemplo, que el diplomático le ha prestado su automóvil para que viaje a la provincia de La Pampa (Comunicación del 24/1/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01 -24-184418-16, CD 280). Otro rasgo de importancia para entender el peso de Khalil en este plan criminal, gira en torno a su vinculación con el acusado Mohsen Rabbani, con quien se comunica telefónicamente y por correo electrónico en forma asidua y con quien se ha venido relacionando desde la época del atentado contra la AMIA: “...te estoy hablando del 93, del 94, cuando explotó la bomba...” (Comunicación del 6/6/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-06-092046-14, CD 48). Khalil sigue recibiendo órdenes del iraní y transmitiéndole periódicamente las novedades de la causa AMIA. Nótese en la siguiente conversación la absoluta fidelidad de Khalil respecto de Rabbani. El 27 de febrero de 2013, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, en ocasión del tratamiento parlamentario del Memorando de Entendimiento, habló con Rabbani y expresó: Khalil: Están en el Congreso, están....están tratando el tema a ver si Ud. va preso, no va preso, y lo que menos nos va a dar bola [ininteligible] va a ser hoy... Rabbani: Defendernos [ininteligible] Khalil: ...lo vamos a defender nosotros, en el congreso, adentro de la cárcel, afuera, en todos lados si Dios quiere, porque nosotros somos los mismo, usted y la comunidad ésta, es lo mismo...si acusan a un iraní, si acusan a un iraní van a tener que acusar a toda la comunidad islámica del país, así de corta se lo digo. Rabbani: ¿qué pasó ahora? ¿Está muy caliente el asunto ese, no? Khalil: Uh, sí está muy caliente, está muy caliente, pero demasiado...yo le estoy mandando los mails, ¿no le llegaron las noticias? Rabbani: Si, si, Yussef gracias. Khalil: Le estoy mandando todos los días, de todos los diarios. (Comunicación del 27/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 02-27-125331-24, CD 297). Existen varios ejemplos de estas comunicaciones entre Khalil y Rabbani, que permiten acreditar fundadamente que Khalil se ha ocupado denodadamente en mantener informado al imputado Mohsen Rabbani de cada aspecto vinculado a su situación procesal, a la causa AMIA en general, al acercamiento de Teherán con Buenos Aires y, naturalmente, al Memorando de Entendimiento, vía para la impunidad del nombrado Rabbani (Comunicación del 27/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2013-02-27-125331-24, CD 297; Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31; Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 05-28-155549-2, CD 39; Comunicación del 24/11/13, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-11-24-103813-4, CD 219 y Comunciación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-04-093431-30, CD 291). Es decir, Khalil le ha reportado directa y continuamente a Mohsen Rabbani, imputado judicialmente por el atentado terrorista contra la AMIA, con pedido de captura nacional e internacional y notificación roja de Interpol vigentes, y beneficiario directo de la maniobra de encubrimiento aquí denunciada. Asimismo, le ha enviado todo tipo de información de su interés y, además, le he hecho saber los datos -públicos y secretos- que recabó de sus fuentes locales, ya sea que provengan de operadores con llegada al despacho presidencial, como el caso del Diputado Larroque; de actores relevantes que responden a los servicios de inteligencia locales como ocurre con “Alian” e Yrimia; y/o de históricos aliados locales de Teherán, como son D'Elía y Esteche. Ejemplo de ello, el 20 de mayo de 2013, luego de la reunión que mantuvo Luis D’Elía con Julio De Vido sobre los deseados negocios con Irán, Khalil inmediatamente llamó a Mohsen Rabbani para informarle lo ocurrido: Khalil: ...hoy terminamos lina reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas...bueno es cuestión de verlo. Rabbani: Mandamepara que evalúe. Khalil: ...yo le mando un mail, bien serio, de cómo fue la conversación y usted evalúa. Rabbani: entonces ¿entiende que es seguro las operaciones? Khalil: Seguro, seguro....si, sí, todo es sobre seguro, Agha, quédese tranquilo que estamos trabajando bien. (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-114842-2, CD31). Como se dijo anteriormente, mientras la justicia nacional acusa fundadamente a ciertos funcionarios iraníes de haber decidido, planificado y ejecutado el atentado terrorista contra la sede de la AMIA en el corazón de la capital, uno de esos imputados, Mohsen Rabbani, negocia con autoridades de nuestro país, a través de intermediarios y canales ocultos, intercambios comerciales de granos y de armamento. Corresponde agregar que no solamente lo ha mantenido informado, cumpliendo con las indicaciones directas de Rabbani, sino que existen pruebas que demuestran que ha procurado transmitirle tranquilidad en distintas fases del avance del encubrimiento, como por ejemplo, al aseverar: “...va a salir todo bien, quédese tranquilo que todo va a salir bien...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31). Así, le ha llevado tranquilidad a uno de los imputados por el atentado: “...Sheik, quédese tranquilo que yo hoy a la noche, cuando llego a mi casa, le mando un informe de todo todo lo que estoy haciendo...”, demostrando -una vez más- su subordinación a Mohsen Rabbani (Comunicación del 20/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-20-160302-28, CD 276). La confianza de Rabbani en Khalil se demostró también, por ejemplo, cuando, luego de una discusión entre ambos y ante el ofuscamiento de Khalil, Rabbani se disculpó diciéndole: “lo maltrato a usted en la confianza porque usted es responsable de todo” (Comunicación del 13/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l 009-2013-02-13-184206- 28, CD 283 y del Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l 009-2013-02-14-164341-10, CD 284). O cuando Rabbani le dijo:	“...no mezcle más las cosas. Usted trabaja conmigo...” (Comunicación del 24/11/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-11-24-103813-4, CD 219) y cuando determinó “...dígale que coordinó conmigo el viaje...” (Comunciación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-l009-2014-02-04-093431-30, CD 291). Además, estos contactos demuestran acabadamente que Mohsen Rabbani, desde Irán, sigue decidiendo y operando en el máximo nivel para el régimen de Teherán, a través de referentes de su máxima confianza, como es el caso de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, quien recibe financiamiento enviado por Rabbani para sustentar la estructura que el encausado supo construir en territorio argentino durante la década que precedió al atentado contra la sede de la AMIA y que continua sosteniendo hasta la fecha con la asistencia de su entorno (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31, Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 05-28-155549-2, CD 39; Comunicación del 19/01/2014, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-19-002737-2, CD 275; Comunicación del 20/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-20-160302- 28, CD 276; Comunicación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2014-02-04-093431 -30, CD 291). La participación de Jorge Khalil en las tratativas, contactos y comunicaciones que viabilizaron el plan de encubrimiento, está reconocida por el mismo, cuando sostuvo a sólo cinco días de la firma del memorándum: “...fijóte con quién se está arreglando el gobierno”, en alusión al acercamiento entre Argentina e Irán, y agregó: “...estoy en esa maniobra...” (Comunicación del 3/2/2013, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-02-03-141619-26, CD 273). Todo lo expuesto corrobora que en las citadas tratativas, Khalil ha participado, representando y operando por Mohsen Rabbani, pero -fundamentalmente- como referente del régimen de Teherán. Por otra parte, Jorge Khalil ha tenido una participación clave en el armado de la pista falsa para desviar la investigación judicial del caso AMIA y desvincular definitivamente a los imputados iraníes. En ese sentido, fue quien se mantuvo en contacto telefónico constante con “Alian”, agente de la Secretaría de Inteligencia encargado de elaborar la nueva hipótesis. Y mucho antes de firmarse el acuerdo, Khalil ya trabajaba en el tema, junto con Fernando Esteche, quien también aportó ideas para fabricar la versión alternativa que explique el atentado. En los últimos meses del año 2012, Esteche había sugerido la incorporación al plan del ex fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA, Héctor Yrimia, con quien - siguiendo esta recomendación- se empezó a reunir Jorge Khalil en noviembre de 2012. Sumar a Yrimia tuvo por fin que la versión construida resulte verosímil y permita con mayor efectividad el deslinde de los iraníes. Sabía perfectamente, para ello había trabajado, que vendría “otra hipótesis, con otras pruebas ”, que se pretendía descolocar al suscripto y ridiculizar a la actual investigación del caso usando pruebas desconocidas para el expediente judicial; y que la “Comisión de la Verdad” no había sido creada para investigar, sino que estaba destinada -justamente- a desvincular a los iraníes:“...alguien va a salir...con la cara manchada de acá...Obvio, eso ya está arreglado... ¿Cómo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo? Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa...” (Comunicación del 27/1/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266; y Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). De hecho, una parte importante de las pruebas que aquí se aportan y que han permitido descubrir y denunciar esta maniobra criminal, son las comunicaciones telefónicas mantenidas por Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil e intervenidas judicialmente en la causa AMIA. Esto significa que, la participación y conocimiento que de los hechos ha tenido Khalil no solo fundan la imputación en su contra, sino que también han permitido al suscripto obtener la información suficiente como para revelar y comprobar el plan de impunidad ejecutado. Resumiendo. Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil ha sido una pieza de importancia fundamental en la ejecución del plan criminal de encubrimiento pergeñado por las más altas autoridades del gobierno argentino. Se trata del referente político local del gobierno de Irán, completamente consustanciado con las ideas y la política del régimen. Militante a tiempo completo de los intereses persas ha sido el clandestino interlocutor iraní en Buenos Aires para cumplir con el iter criminis de la impunidad. Al no tener una función oficial, su figura ha encajado a la perfección en esa tarea, oficiando de canal de comunicación para recibir y entregar los mensajes secretos y clandestinos que se enviaron encubridores y encubiertos. Por lo demás, motorizó la finalidad mediata del encubrimiento, esto es, el intercambio comercial a nivel estatal entre Argentina e Irán. En esa línea tendió numerosos puentes entre agentes gubernamentales y operadores iraníes, el más importante de los cuales puede resumirse en el interés de intercambiar “petróleo por granos” comunicado por parte del Ministro Julio De Vido, en cumplimiento de órdenes emanadas de Cristina Fernández.       ALBERTO N!SM<írg Ministerio Público de la Nación	fiscal general./ Asimismo y como ya se señaló, participó del armado de la hipótesis alternativa y su aporte resultó fundamental en la buena marcha del plan de encubrimiento. e)	""Alian ”, miembro de la Secretaría de Inteligencia. respecto de quien hay fuertes indicios que su nombre verdadero sería Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. En la ejecución del plan criminal, la persona identificada como “Alian” cumplió un rol imprescindible. En su condición de funcionario de la Secretaría de Inteligencia, con llegada directa al entorno presidencial, ha sido un actor clave en la interacción entre las altas figuras gubernamentales involucradas en los hechos. Es decir, ha sido especialmente seleccionado para instrumentar, materializar y llevar adelante los designios criminales de la Sra. Presidente y del Sr. Canciller. En primer lugar, corresponde dejar aclarado que “Alian” podría tratarse del Sr. Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. Sin haberse realizado medidas probatorias intrusivas que permitan develar esta cuestión, por considerar que las mismas corresponden a las autoridades judiciales que intervengan en la denuncia que aquí se radica, se pudo obtener la siguiente información:  2)	En la red social “Sónico” fue posible hallar una titularidad de cuenta que coincide con el encabezamiento de la dirección de mail “allanbogad”, igual a la que envió “Alian” a Khalil (se adjuntan impresiones correspondientes a la cuenta “allanbogad” en red social “Sónico”). 3)	De una comunicación telefónica surge que “Alian” sería oriundo de la Provincia de Misiones. En efecto, en referencia al Senador Nacional por Misiones, Juan Manuel Irrazábal, Khalil le dijo a “Alian”: “te vas a llevar bien con él porque es de tu provincia” (Comunicación del 5/12/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-12-05-192539-18, CD 230). 4)	En publicaciones necrológicas de un periódico de la Provincia de Misiones, que comunica el deceso de “Alian Héctor Bogado” -quien falleciera, según los datos obtenidos, a los 78 años de edad-, se identifican a varios de sus familiares y allegados. Su nombre, casi homónimo de la persona de interés en esta pesquisa, permite presumir -a priori- cierta vinculación familiar entre ambos, reforzando la hipótesis que el contacto de Khalil, “Alian” de Misiones, podría ser “Ramón Héctor Alian Bogado” (se adjuntan impresiones de los avisos necrológicos del diario “El Territorio” publicados en 29 y 30 de agosto de 2013). 5)	En el mismo periódico misionero se observan fotografías que ilustran a un hombre de mediana edad, a quien se identifica como “Alian Bogado”. En la fotografía se encuentra acompañado de otras personas, cuyos nombres coinciden con algunos de los contactos de la cuenta “allanbogad” de la red social “Sónico” y con varios de los deudos del fallecido “Alian Héctor Bogado” (“Mirando el río”, El Territorio, versión digital, del 6/02/2006). En base a todos estos indicios es dable sospechar que “Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado” podría ser la identidad del contacto de Khalil nombrado en las comunicaciones telefónicas como “Alian”, sin perjuicio de lo cual, naturalmente, se trata de una circunstancia más a ser corroborada por el magistrado interviniente en el marco de los hechos aquí denunciados. Más allá de la correcta identificación de este sujeto, lo cierto es que se trata de un miembro de la Secretaría de Inteligencia que se ha pronunciado y ha actuado, en reiteradas ocasiones, a favor de intereses extranjeros en detrimento de los nacionales. Que ha transmitido informaciones secretas y protegidas por la ley de inteligencia a agentes de una potencia extranjera. Que ha trabajado y negociado la impunidad de los prófugos de la causa AMIA. En ese rol no hesitó en transmitir información sensible y clasificada a la contraparte iraní. Tampoco dudó en contribuir al armado de una “pista falsa” con pruebas falsas ni en conspirar contra las autoridades judiciales a cargo de la investigación y, menos aún, en utilizar los resortes del estado nacional para establecer buenas relaciones con la comunidad iraní, articularle favores y allanar cualquier obstáculo que surgiera durante la ejecución del plan de encubrimiento. El hecho de que lo haya efectuado cumpliendo órdenes superiores en nada lo exculpa. Profundizando lo afirmado, en primer lugar corresponde hacer notar que los elementos colectados indican que “Alian” trabaja para la Secretaría de Inteligencia. Su pertenencia a dicho organismo queda fuera de discusión por su propia confesión y por la información que maneja. Préstese atención a la siguiente conversación entre “Alian” y Khalil, mantenida el 2 de junio de 2013. Khalil: Dos cositas... ¿cómo ves el cambio que hubo en el gobierno? La ida de la mujer2'. “Alian”: No hubo cambios. Khalil: ¿Cómo no? ¿No sacaron a los ministros? “Alian” Pero hubo cambio de nombres, no de situación. Khalil: No, no, pero el cambio de nombre, especialmente el de la mina, ¿cómo lo ves? “Alian”: Y...para nosotros, adentro....donde yo trabajo es complicado. Para ellos, donde están, es lo mismo, el que estaba /aburando era el Loco ... Khalil: “ah ok....mañana quiero una charla con vos en algún momento “Alian”: sí, sí. Yo te lo digo claro, el Director de Interior nuestro estaba 23 porque es el novio de la hija de la señora que se fue... Khalil: Si, ¿pero vos crees que la sacaron a la que se fue? Te pregunto eso concretamente... “AlianAh, porque ahora viene todo un tema interno. Ella estaba con su amigo Milán i, que tiene una inteligencia paralela... eh.... (Comunicación del 2/6/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-02-221245-20, CD 44). En otra oportunidad, “Alian” dijo: “...Tengo un chisme...me dijeron ahí en 'la casa' ...Interpol va a levantar el pedido de captura de los amigos...Lo va a levantar ahora... ”, aludiendo a la Secretaría de Inteligencia como “la casa” (Conversación del 25/2/13, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-25-151137-12, CD 295). Y	sus propios interlocutores se encuentran en conocimiento de que cumple funciones en el organismo de inteligencia nacional. Por ejemplo, Esteche señaló: “ ...Alian” lo podría resolver, si es un interés, si es un interés de inteligencia... ” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226) y Khalil expresó: “...le fueron a hacer 'rancho' a ese ""Alian” y a toda esa banda...nada, fueron a protestar ahí a 25 de Mayo24... ” (Comunicación del 17/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-17-134828-28, CD 89) y se refirió a “Alian” como “el Jefe de la SIDE”, destacando que éste le había mencionado “una interna fuerte entre ellos”, entendiéndose por ese “ellos” a los servicios de inteligencia (Comunicaciones del 1/06/2013, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo 224753, CD 0086; Archivo 61.30373.20130601.22551 1, CD 0086). Sumado a este significativo conjunto de indicios, el mismo “Alian” mencionó viajar a la zona de Triple Frontera en la etapa culmine de las negociaciones con Irán, circunstancia por demás llamativa, que no cabe soslayar en este análisis (Comunicación del 22/11/2012, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11 -22-121757-24, CD 200). Por otra parte, se han registrado referencias que indican que el Dr. Héctor Yrimia responde al mismo sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia que “Alian”, quien lo describe así: “...Yrimia...es empleado mío ese...” (Comunicación del 7/10/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-10-07-141519-20, CD 171). Además posee estrecha vinculación con la agrupación oficialista “La Cámpora”, la cual se vislumbra en distintas piezas probatorias. Por ejemplo, la conversación que mantuvo con Khalil en la que sostuvo: “ ...me vinieron a ver los pibes de La Cámpora....quieren pegarse un acercamiento con ustedes” (Comunicación del 6/2/2013, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276). En otra oportunidad, más precisamente el 24 de mayo de 2013, vísperas de una marcha por el aniversario de la Revolución de Mayo, explicó: “...yo tengo que organizar que la columna de La Cámpora llegue bien adelante, así que a las 11 nos juntamos en la central, que es Piedras y Chile. De ahí los saco y nos metemos todos ahí adentro con los pendejos, una vez que termine, me voy...’’'’ (Comunicación del 24/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-24-175330-20.txt, CD 35). También pertenece al más íntimo entorno presidencial. Al respecto, cabe recordar cuando Fernando Esteche le sugirió a Khalil que exija algunos gestos del gobierno, que involucren personalmente a la Dra. Fernández, para lo que aclaró: “...que la Presidenta vaya...eso es más fácil para Alian...”, dejando entrever nuevamente el acceso estratégico de “Alian” al entorno de la Dra. Fernández (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Prueba de la cercanía de “Alian” al entorno presidencial es la información que éste maneja. El 24 de mayo de 2013 le manifestó a Khalil: “Te cuento la doctora está con gripe y está con una fiebre de la puta madre. Así que está con un quilombo de la puta madre, a ver si mañana arranca para hablar....si va a hablar, va a hablar de última....después de las cuatro o	cinco” (Comunicación del 24/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-24-175330-20.txt, CD 35). El 7 de octubre de 2013, Khalil y “Alian” hablaron de la salud de la Sra. Presidente. “Alian”: y...tiene un coágulo viste, casi seguro que la operan...Ella se da cuenta el sábado cuando empezó a hacer gimnasia. Khalil: ¿se iba para un costado? “Alian”: le empezó a pie... ¿viste cuando se te duerme la mano?...que te da picazón. ¡Ypensaron que era del corazón y salieron cagando! Bueno, de allí le hacen todo un estudio dentro de, del sistema médico de la quinta, le meten el anticoagulante, que eso es muy bueno, eso no siguió el daño, ¿entendés? Khalil: Ahora parece que la están llevando, ahora en estos momentos, la están llevando a...en la Favaloro, ¿no? “Alian”: Ya está internada hace una hora y media. (Comunicación del 7/10/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-10-07-141519-20, CD 171). Efectivamente, según la información que se comunicó a la prensa, en el parte oficial rubricado por la Unidad Médica Presidencial y difundido por el Secretario de Comunicación, Alfredo Scoccimarro, la Dra. Fernández había concurrido a la Fundación Favaloro para realizarse un estudio cardiovascular por una arritmia, con un cuadro de cefalea. Scoccimarro dijo que la Sra. Presidente había sufrido un traumatismo de cráneo el 12 de agosto que no había presentado hasta el momento ningún síntoma (“Silencio y misterio alrededor del golpe que sufrió Cristina Fernández”, Perfil, 7/10/2013; “El misterio de un golpe del que no se informó”, La Nación, 07/10/2013). Como puede advertirse, ni de la información oficial, ni de la información obtenida y circulada por los medios periodísticos hasta ese lunes 7 de octubre de 2013, se desprende el grado de detalle que “Alian” tenía sobre la salud de la Sra. Presidente, de las circunstancias en que el cuadro clínico fue detectado, de su sintomatología inicial y del tratamiento médico que recibió Cristina Fernández antes de ser trasladada al sanatorio. Es decir, “Alian” poseía información privilegiada y verídica de la salud de la primera mandataria, que en ese momento no era pública. Y la poseía en detalle, además de actualizada. Es decir, como se dijo y se probó, pertenece al entorno más cercano a la presidente. Esta pertenencia es lógica si se analiza su actuación en el plan criminal. De lo contrario, nunca se le hubiera encargado una tarea en extremo sensible: ejecutar una acción delictiva por directa orden de la Sra. Presidente. En efecto, su accionar abarcó varios aspectos del plan de encubrimiento. En primer lugar actuó como nexo entre las autoridades del gobierno nacional involucradas en el plan de encubrimiento y los canales paralelos de comunicación. En ese sentido, no sorprende que sea “Alian” quien, apenas suscripto el tratado con Irán, se haya comunicado con Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil para pedirle que le transmita a Luis D'Elía un mensaje directo de Cristina Fernández: Que no hable por 10 días. “Alian”: ...lo que le tenes que decir al negro....que esté tranquilo, por diez días no comentes nada. Khalil: Ahora lo llamo (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 1	-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). Inmediatamente, Khalil se comunicó con Luis D’Elía y le pasó el mensaje. Khalil: Escúchame eh...por las dudas que te llamen hoy los medios o alguno, tené perfil bajo, por 10 días por lo menos. D’Elía: Bueno. Khalil: Yo sé por qué te lo digo... D’Elía: Bárbaro....me dijo Parrilli recién también. (Comunicación del 28/01/2013, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-28-135905-20, CD 267) El pedido en sí mismo no es importante. Sí lo es la comprobación de que “Alian” cumple órdenes directamente emanadas de la Presidente. Esto se evidencia por el hecho de pedir exactamente lo mismo que el exSecretario General de la Presidencia, Oscar Parrilli, pero por otros canales. Es decir, la orden fue: Que D’Elía no hable. La transmiten tanto Parrilli como “Alian”. El hecho de comunicar idénticas directivas estratégicas revela una misma fuente que, aquí todo indica, se trata de la Dra. Fernández, lo que no hace más que corroborar la posición de “Alian” en el entorno presidencial. En otra comunicación con Jorge “Yussuf” Khalil, del 6 de febrero de 2013, en relación a la entonces reciente firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, “Alian” dijo: “...estamos muy bien y hay que laburar tranquilos ...tenemos que hacer un trabajo de acá a 10 años, ¿me entendés? Que en un año y medio tengamos las buenas noticias, pero acá hay que hacer un trabajo para mucho tiempo”. Khalil: Seguilo de cerca eso, eh\ “Alian”: Si, pero tranquilo, está cerrado muy arriba, quedate tranca. Khalil: Si, si....seguilo igual...yo sé por qué te lo digo....porque yo escucho del otro lado también, vos escuchas de un lado, yo escucho del otro ” “Alian”: hh bueno, pero acá, una vez que salga la ley,... no podemos, podemos volver Khalil: No, no, seguro, si allá está todo bien, pero lo que pasa....después te cuento cuando nos veamos....porque me mandaron un par de cosas que no me cerraron, entonces después te cuento. (Comunicación del 6/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276). Asimismo, corresponde dejar asentado que la relación entre “Alian” y Khalil se ha ido fortaleciendo. Para congraciarse con la parte iraní, “Alian” le ha ido abriendo puertas de importantes oficinas del gobierno. En ese tren de “favores” a los iraníes, le consiguió a Khalil una reunión con Ricardo Echegaray, titular de la Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos (AFIP) por un tema relacionado a unos seguros de caución. De hecho, cuando Khalil le pidió a “Alian” este contacto, aquel le respondió: “...no hay problema...te venís conmigo...” (Comunicación del 13/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-13-213124- 24, CD 55). También Khalil le ha pedido favores para sus contactos en la Aduana (Comunicación del 24/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-24-175330-20.txt, CD 35). De hecho, en otra oportunidad, “Alian” se comprometió a conseguirle cargos en la Dirección Nacional de Aduanas y en el Ministerio de Interior y Transporte para gente de la 19	En alusión a Timerman 21 En referencia a Nilda Garré, que había sido separada de la conducción del Ministerio de Seguridad. 23	En alusión a Fernando Pocino, Director de Interior de la Secretaria de Inteligencia. 24	Sede de uno de los edificios de la Secretaría de Inteligencia. comunidad chiita, “...tiene que haber cambios en transporte y aduana y ahí van a tratar de meter ...diez tipos en cada lado” (Comunicaciones del 4/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-04-112603-6.txt, CD 76 y del 7/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-07- 152130-22, CD 79). Estos episodios indican que existió una orden, desde lo más alto del poder, que había autorizado determinado accesos, contactos y facilidades a los referentes de Irán en Argentina, dentro del contexto mucho más amplio que significó el plan de impunidad. “Alian” ha sido un actor central en este “abrir puertas” a los contactos locales de los imputados prófugos. Una prueba más de la cercanía entre quienes llevaron adelante la maniobra encubridora. Además, cuando se firmó finalmente el acuerdo, “Alian” le dijo a Khalil: “ ...Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me tenías fe...”, identificándose a sí mismo y a su interlocutor, como integrantes de una misma parte del acuerdo, como partícipes de un mismo interés que, hoy ya se sabe, era más que eso, era un plan delictivo para brindar impunidad (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). El alineamiento con los acusados iraníes también se trasluce en sus propias palabras, dado que hasta ha llegado a calificarlos de “amigos” (Comunicación del 25/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 02-25-151137-12, CD 295). “Alian”, en incontables oportunidades documentadas, le ha proporcionado a un operador del régimen iraní como Jorge Khalil, que tiene directa y fluida relación con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani, información política del gobierno de Cristina Fernández que no es pública. Esto también revela el enorme grado de confianza que “Alian” ha depositado en Jorge Khalil. En una ocasión, Khalil solicitó que le chequee ciertas cuestiones, por ejemplo, le dijo:	“...tengo	una reunión con una persona...que dice ser amigo y, la verdad, necesito chequear algunas cosas...'’'’ (Comunicación del 22/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-22-121757-24, CD 200). Este tipo de pedidos constituyen nuevas comprobaciones sobre la vinculación entre “Alian” y la inteligencia. Cuando Khalil le pide a “Alian” que le chequee información sobre tal cuestión o persona, es como si el propio Mohsen Rabbani -a quien Khalil responde y con quien habla periódicamente- esté utilizando los servicios de inteligencia del estado para sus necesidades e intereses. Además, este sujeto le relató al agente de Irán, Jorge Khalil, que había estado en Suiza un mes antes de que se suscribiera el acuerdo en Africa, para trabajar en el mismo: “...todo lo que laburamos en esto...vos sabés que yo hace un mes estuve allá en Ginebra...” (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732- 18.wav, CD 267). La intervención de “Alian” luce evidente. Otro aporte fundamental de “Alian” a la ejecución del plan criminal remite a la construcción de la nueva hipótesis delictiva para la causa AMIA que desplace a las acusaciones alzadas por la justicia nacional contra los iraníes. En ese sentido, “Alian” expresó: “...ya estamos en otro país, es otra situación mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto... ”, y este “trabajar en otro contexto” implicaba que la prioridad era un acercamiento geopolítico a Irán, que imponía dejar de lado las acusaciones contra funcionarios de dichos país (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD43). Con ese fin, le comunicó al agente de Irán: “...él sabe lo que va a venir, que va a venir otra hipótesis, con otras pruebas y a hacer culo al norte porque nunca las vio él las pruebas, ¿me entendiste hermano?... ”, está hablando del suscripto (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01 -224726-18, CD 43). En pocas palabras, este sujeto, con una posición estratégica dentro del gobierno nacional, le comunicó a un agente que opera para una potencia extranjera, que se van a presentar pruebas falsas para alterar ilegalmente el curso de una causa judicial, deslegitimar a los actuales investigadores y encubrir a los imputados y esa información fue enviada a un acusado y prófugo de la justicia argentina. Cabe destacar la gravedad de las acciones realizadas por “Alian” en este entramado, porque desde su posición en el gobierno nacional proporcionó datos que no son públicos, incluida información de la causa, del suscripto y del acuerdo, a un representante orgánico de Irán - Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil-, quien luego se los comunicó a varias personas, entre ellos, a Mohsen Rabbani, uno de los acusados de terrorismo por la justicia argentina y con notificación roja emitida por Interpol. Al mismo tiempo, la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller, haciendo gala de sus habilidades para tergiversar la realidad proclamaban que el único interés que los movía era destrabar la causa y que solo buscaban verdad y justicia. Vaya paradoja. Por último, podría resultar llamativo que “Alian” no haya considerado necesario actuar en forma encubierta. Ello solo puede deberse a la circunstancia, como ya se demostró, de que estaba actuando por órdenes superiores. Sus contactos de Irán sabían perfectamente a quienes respondía y en qué ámbito se desempeñaba, él mismo ha admitido que la información que ha manejado provenía de donde trabajaba, la Secretaría de Inteligencia, y así ha transmitido información reservada sin necesidad de encubrir su identidad o su actividad, con la tranquilidad propia de quien cumple órdenes y no de quien viola secretos y pone en peligro su fuente de trabajo. Y	además de proveer información secreta y reservada a los contactos locales iraníes, “Alian” ha transmitido tranquilidad en distintos momentos del despliegue encubridor. Así, por ejemplo, cuando se hizo público el nuevo pronunciamiento emitido por esta Unidad Fiscal el 29 de mayo de 2013, en la que se presentaron nuevas pruebas que profundizaban la implicación de los acusados iraníes en el atentado, le dijo a Khalil en referencia a tal dictamen: “ ...Queda ahí...cuando llega al juez para arriba, ¿cómo va a hacer?” (Comunicación del 31/05/2013, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-31-095657-14, CD 42), dejando entrever que estaba todo controlado, que nada iba a pasar con ese dictamen fiscal, porque la decisión última depende de las distintas instancias del Poder Judicial y no de lo que demuestre o sostenga el Ministerio Público Fiscal. De este modo mantenía la tranquilidad y los buenos vínculos con los referentes de Teherán en Buenos Aires, a quienes debía contener y asistir, con el fin último de sostener la “próspera” relación con el régimen iraní y así facilitar el avance del plan criminal. En conclusión, existen fundados elementos para aseverar que los autores de este plan criminal han puesto a una persona allegada al poder de la Secretaría de Inteligencia, de la confianza de la Sra. Presidente, para colaborar con la actividad de los iraníes en paralelo a la implementación de la maniobra de encubrimiento. Y, a través de esta persona -que no es otra que “Alian”- han abierto las puertas de las estructuras del estado para que los representantes locales de Teherán puedan utilizar resortes y contactos, en su favor. Se está en presencia de uno de los sujetos de los que se valieron los encubridores para llevar adelante el plan criminal. Está claro que “Alian” ha sido cuidadosamente seleccionado. Por ser tener acceso al entorno presidencial, por responder a la Secretaría de Inteligencia, por su declarada simpatía con el régimen iraní, por ser un contacto directo y asiduo de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, por su dedicación, obediencia y, sobre todo, por su falta de escrúpulos a la hora de manipular pruebas, personas e inventar hipótesis falsas para lograr la consecución del encubrimiento. d)	Femando Luis Esteche Fernando Esteche es el líder de la agrupación “Quebracho” y desde antaño, ha expresado una clara postura en contra a la acusación a los iraníes por el caso AMIA. A su vez, la cercana vinculación entre miembros del grupo “Quebracho” y funcionarios y ex funcionarios del gobierno de Cristina   Ministerio Público de la Nación Fernández, ha sido expuesta a la opinión pública. De hecho, se calificó a “Quebracho” como un “adherente al oficialismo” (Morales Solá, Joaquín, “Las dos miradas de EEUU”, La Nación, 23/02/2014). Y se dijo que a pesar de la detención de Esteche, esta agrupación había mantenido “...vínculos informales con los K...” (Van Der Kooy, Eduardo, “El activismo de Quebracho ocupa el vacío callejero que dejaron los K”, Clarín, 20/02/2014). En julio de 2011 se conocieron datos que denunciaban que Luis D'Elía y la agrupación Quebracho, entre otras, estaban recibiendo apoyo político y hasta financiero del gobierno iraní (Dinatale, Martín, “Preocupan vínculos con D'Elía y Quebracho”, La Nación, 18/7/11). Para comprender la participación de Femando Esteche en este plan de encubrimiento, se debe tener presente que también se encuentra vinculado al imputado Mohsen Rabbani, al Diputado Andrés Larroque y mantiene fluidos contactos con Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil. En efecto, ha viajado a la República Islámica de Irán a fines de febrero y principios de marzo de 2010, junto a los imputados Luis D’Elía y Jorge Khalil, ocasión en la que participó del 31° aniversario de la Revolución Islámica y oportunidad en la que tuvo contacto personal con Mohsen Rabbani (“D’Elía y Esteche vieron en Irán a un sospechoso de volar la AMIA”, Perfil, 6/3/2010). Por otra parte, su relación con el Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque es un hecho. Esteche mismo lo ha reconocido: “...hoy lo tengo que ver, si, hoy vengo a Capital a verlo a él...”, en alusión al Diputado Larroque (Comunicación del 19/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-19-121034-16, CD 197). Tan es así, que en función del vínculo existente entre Esteche y Larroque, Khalil le ha pedido que lo ayude a construir una relación directa con el diputado (Comunicación del 20/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11 -20-131705- 12, CD 198). Ahora bien, se trata del sujeto que ha viabilizado o hecho posible el avance del plan de encubrimiento mediante, al menos, dos conductas concretas. Primera, posibilitó la vinculación del agente iraní en Buenos Aires, Jorge Khalil, con funcionarios del gobierno argentino. Específicamente lo ha contactado con los operadores de la Secretaria de Inteligencia, el sujeto apodado “Alian” y el Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia, quienes han participado, entre otras cuestiones, del armado de la falsa hipótesis que debía desplazar a la que involucra a los iraníes encubiertos. En efecto, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil reconoció expresamente que se ha sentado a la mesa con los funcionarios de la Secretaría de Inteligencia para trabajar en el avance del plan encubridor gracias a la gestión de Esteche (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2012-11 -04-130024-6, CD 182). Segunda. Esteche, personalmente, ha contribuido con ideas específicas para la construcción de la nueva y falsa hipótesis del gobierno de Cristina Fernández para el atentado del 18 de julio de 1994. Véase lo que expresaba en diciembre de 2012 acerca de los pasos que se debían tomar en relación al encubrimiento: “...el nuevo responsable de AMIA, por ejemplo, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla, van a querer ir construyendo el consenso de esto...no van a poder decir que fueron los israelíes... ”, sugiriendo que podían atribuirle el hecho a “...una conexión de fachos locales...” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Y aportando una idea concreta, agregó: “...El Fiscal de AMIA es de ellos, Yrimia, que lo echaron del caso AMIA, él te puede...generar información, quiero que me den información del caso AMIA, ¿se puede o no se puede? ¿Qué están dispuestos a aportar?..?'’ (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Ha sido precisamente Esteche quien contactó al Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia y lo conectó con el referente local de Irán en el país, Jorge Khalil, para que le brinde información de la causa judicial a los fines de contribuir a fabricar, con cierto grado de credibilidad en virtud de los datos aportados, una nueva hipótesis sobre el atentado, con otros imputados. En efecto, en una conversación Khalil comentó que estuvo reunido por dos horas con “el ex juez y ex fiscal de la causa AMIA, Yrimia” y que el contacto venía de parte de conocidos de Esteche (Comunicación del 19/1/14, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo IN-12177-20140119-003044, CD 49). Recuérdese que, al momento del atentado, Yrimia era Fiscal de Primera Instancia en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal a cargo de la Fiscalía N°6 y fue designado el mismo día del hecho para colaborar con la investigación, en carácter conjunto, alterno o sucesivo respecto de otros fiscales también nombrados a esos efectos, lo que le franqueó el acceso al expediente en sus primeros tiempos. Este es un aporte central del Sr. Esteche al desenvolvimiento del plan aquí ejecutado y tuvo lugar meses antes de la firma del acuerdo con Irán, lo que demuestra -también- la planificación y el conocimiento con el que actuaban estos sujetos cuando aún nadie, ni los propios familiares sabían, siquiera, que se iba a firmar un acuerdo y, mucho menos, podían conocer su contenido. Era lógico: en el trazado criminal, la maniobra que se pergeñaba los perjudicaba directamente. Además, existen otros elementos que convalidan la vinculación de Esteche con los iraníes al comprobarse que ha recibido recursos económicos procedentes de Irán. Khalil comentó al respecto: “...« Fernando, la gente que trabaja con Heshmat ...le está bajando recursos ...todos los meses ...fijo todos los meses ...por empleado... ” (Comunicación del 30/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	11-30-163313-28, CD 208). Esta red de vinculación lo convirtió en otro eje importante de los ductos de negociación y comunicación, que motorizaron y viabilizaron el plan de encubrimiento en curso. e)	Héctor Luis Yrimia Otra de las personas que tuvo una participación relevante, colaboró y suministró información a los agentes iraníes en Argentina, que aportó para la construcción de la nueva hipótesis falsa e hizo avanzar el plan encubridor, fue el ex Juez Nacional en lo Criminal de Instrucción y ex Fiscal Federal, Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia. El primer registro contabilizado del contacto entre Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil y Héctor Yrimia data de principios de noviembre de 2012: “Tuve una charla con el Fiscal...El Fiscal de la causa....el que estaba, no el que está ahora, el que estaba...'’'1 (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-04-130024-6, CD 182). Esto ya ocurría poco más de un mes después que se anunciara públicamente la negociación con Irán y antes de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento. Presente el desarrollo de los acontecimientos posteriores, es de toda lógica que para esa época ya se estuviera trabajando en la construcción de la pista alternativa, de la falsa hipótesis que desplazaría la imputación a los acusados iraníes. Yrimia se sumó al plan e inició sus fluidos contactos con los referentes locales de Teherán gracias a la intermediación de Fernando Esteche. Y así lo explicó Khalil: “...Y, el que me sienta es Fernando”. (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012- 11-04-130024-6, CD 182), quien lo sugiere como fuente de información “eso te puede servir bien concreto para cualquiera de las tesis ...cualquiera de las cosas que vayan a resolverse va a servir porque es información” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	12-18-183332-8,	CD 226). Y existen importantes elementos que lo vinculan con la Secretaría de Inteligencia: “el fiscal de AMIA es de ellos, Yrimia” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Estas referencias indican que el Dr. Yrimia respondería al mismo sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia que “Alian”, quien sostiene:	“ ...Yrimia. ..es empleado mío ese...” (Comunicación del 7/10/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	10-07-141519-20,	CD 171). Los contactos de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil con el Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia continuaron mes tras mes y se fueron profundizando. En enero de 2014, Khalil le comentó a Abdul Karim Paz: “...Hoy hablé con el ex juez y ex fiscal de la causa AMIA, Yrimia...tuve una reunión dos horas...” (Comunicación del 19/1/14, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo IN-12177- 20140119-003044, CD 49). De hecho, para la misma época se registraron conversaciones entre Khalil y Héctor Luis Yrimia, que dan cuenta de su participación en el plan delictivo (Comunicaciones del 20/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-20-205332-26 CD 276 y Comunicación del 24/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01 -24-153750- 18, CD 280). Ya en febrero de 2014 se registraron comunicaciones en las que el abogado se ha identificado, sin dejar lugar a ninguna hesitación: ''""'...Buen día, Jorge. Luis Yrimia...”, a lo cual Khalil respondió: “¿Cómo le va, doctor querido?’’'’ (Comunicación del 11/02/2014, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-11-114448-6, CD 298). El importante grado de confianza que revelan los contactos entre Khalil e Yrimia no solo se condice con los serios asuntos que los unen sino que dan cuenta del avance en sus tareas. Hay evidencias que confirman que Jorge Khalil reunió, en más de una oportunidad, al Dr. Yrimia con el Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, circunstancia de la cual solo estaba al tanto el agente de inteligencia “Alian” (Comunicaciones del 23/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-23-212332- 26, CD 279; Comunicación del 24/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-24-153750-18, CD 280; Comunicación del 11/02/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2014-02-11-114448- 6, CD 298). Además, existen datos que demuestran que los temas entre ambos se fueron diversificando y abordaron la posibilidad de producir acercamientos religiosos (Comunicación del 19/01/2014, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-l009-2014-01-19-002737-2, CD 275). Así lo reconoció el mismo Khalil al comentar: “...me junto con el número uno de los que operan políticamente para el Vaticano...son los que están acomodando toda la historia...”, en alusión a la fabricación de la pista falta que redireccione la investigación de la causa “AMIA” hacia otra hipótesis y nuevos imputados. Y agregó: “...nosotros estamos hablando de trabajar, de hacer un trabajo conjunto entre la iglesia y el chiismo...esas son las excusas. Ahora, después, estos tipos operaron mucho el tema... uno fue... ex juez de la causa AMIA...Yrimia...Yrimia...con ese me junto hoy...” (Comunicación del 22/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2014-	01-22-102353-16, CD 278). La reunión por cuestiones religiosas, completamente ajena al objeto de la denuncia, constituye una excusa, como lo reconoce Khalil, toda vez que la vinculación con Yrimia giró siempre en tomo al encubrimiento de los acusados por AMIA. De hecho, al hablar de “Alian”, tanto Khalil como Yrimia se refieren al “amigo en común”, con quien deben juntarse por “el otro tema”, es decir, la cuestión “aparte del trabajo religioso”, en clara alusión a la causa AMIA y la elaboración de la hipótesis que sirva para despistar la investigación y desarticular la acusación contra los iraníes (Comunicación del 03/02/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-03- 144547-22, CD 290). No puede soslayarse una referencia al enmascaramiento con que estos personajes han cubierto sus actividades delictivas. Mientras se reunían por cuestiones lícitas y legítimas, como ser el acercamiento entre dos religiones, han motorizado, al mismo tiempo y en las mismas reuniones, el plan criminal encabezado por la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller. Esta forma de actuar es, lamentablemente, conocida para esta Unidad Fiscal pues se trata nada menos que del modo dual que los agentes iraníes han utilizado para ocultar actividades subrepticias y hasta delictivas. Ocultan sus fines criminales detrás de fachadas religiosas o culturales. Así, es realmente preocupante ver replicado ese accionar en este nuevo encubrimiento o, al menos, en una parte de él. Concluyendo, lo cierto es que el plan para generar la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iraníes sigue vigente. Sus partícipes   Ministerio Público de la Nación continúan trabajando, tal como ha podido comprobarse en los recientes párrafos. La contribución del Dr. Yrimia al plan criminal ha sido sustancial. Ha puesto al servicio de la maniobra de encubrimiento su conocimiento sobre la causa AMIA. Se trata de un conocimiento específico pues lo ha obtenido en el ejercicio de su anterior cargo como Fiscal Federal especialmente designado por la Procuración General de la Nación para intervenir en la investigación del atentado perpetrado contra la sede de la AMIA (Resolución N°37/94 del 18/07/1994), por instrucción expresa del Ministerio de Justicia (Resolución N°83 de la misma fecha). En esa condición ha conocido los hechos en detalle, ha visto las pruebas, las testimoniales, los peritajes, los informes técnicos, el resultado de los allanamientos, ha escuchado las versiones de los primeros imputados. Este minucioso grado de cognición lo ha vuelto fundamental para el buen desarrollo del plan. Y	justamente su aporte se ha realizado donde resulta más útil: en el armado de la hipótesis falsa. Estuvo y está en condiciones de indicar con certeza si tal o cual teoría resulta verosímil o no, si encaja con las probanzas con que cuenta el expediente, si debe modificarse algún punto, etc. Es decir que, valiéndose de la información obtenida en ocasión de ejercer la función pública, se ha abocado a esta participación criminal. Además, tampoco puede soslayarse que se ha desempeñado varios años como Juez de la Nación. De allí que también posea los conocimientos técnicos necesarios para viabilizar la falsa hipótesis. Es evidente, entonces, que su aporte ha resultado extremadamente valioso en el plan delictivo aquí denunciado. d)	Andrés Larrogue Ha quedado demostrado que tanto Luis D’Elía como Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil son personas que han sido cuidadosamente seleccionadas para oficiar de nexos clandestinos en el plan de encubrimiento. Una de las cualidades que comparten es que, pese a la profunda consustanciación con los gobiernos a los que representan y la confianza que inspiran en sus mandantes, no son figuras oficiales. No ejercen cargos públicos ni tienen responsabilidades políticas visibles en los gobiernos a los que sirven. Pero como denominador común, operan muy cerca del poder, son de confianza del poder y, valga la redundancia, poseen -en sus respectivos ámbitos- mucho poder. Para intermediar entre los autores del plan delictivo y varios de sus ejecutores, se recurrió a una persona que pudiera dar cuenta, fácilmente, de sus contactos tanto con unos como con otros: el Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, quien ha oficiado de nexo entre la Presidenta de la Nación, Dra. Cristina Fernández y Luis D’Elía, a los efectos de avanzar con el delito aquí denunciado. Esta afirmación no es una simple conjetura, ni siquiera se trata de una inferencia o una deducción. Aquí se reproduce prueba directa que lo demuestra. Khalil ha admitido sin ambages haber recibido mensajes directamente de parte de Larroque: “...yo estuve hablando con D'Elíay con el ‘Cuervo ’ Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmití al Safír  y el Safir me dijo lo mismo...no hagamos algo que pueda molestar’''' (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18- 095153-16, CD 196). Respecto al mismo encuentro aclaró: “...recién he tenido una reunión con Luis D’Elía y el ‘Cuervo’ Larroque, el de La Cámpora...que querían hablar conmigo, que tenían un mensaje del gobierno para dar...y ahora me voy para Martínez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador’’’ (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-1 l-17-104846-10.wav, CD 195). La interacción es evidente. Larroque ha transmitido mensajes emanados de las autoridades del gobierno nacional involucradas en el encubrimiento y Khalil los ha hecho llegar a la contraparte iraní. Se trataron de mensajes relativos al plan criminal comunicados a través de canales paralelos. La intermediación de Larroque entre Cristina Fernández y D’Elía quedó evidenciada ante la opinión pública en general cuando se publicó que el Diputado le había transmitido a D'Elía el siguiente mensaje: “Dice Cristina que no hables más hasta las elecciones” (“Cristina furiosa con D'Elía: No hables más hasta las elecciones”, La Política On Line, 26/9/2013). Esta información periodística se condice en un todo con los datos que surgen de las conversaciones telefónicas aquí transcriptas y/o referenciadas, en tanto que a través suyo ha entrado y salido la información al despacho presidencial, al menos, en varios episodios relacionados con los hechos aquí denunciados. Este rol de intermediario también fue necesario en las cuestiones comerciales que han estado subyacentes al encubrimiento. Así, Khalil dio cuenta de haber transmitido mensajes sobre temas comerciales con Irán: “...yo fui a hablar con D'Elía y le dije...todas las propuestas y de la cancillería, de la cancillería también...lo que me había propuesto... Y él lo elevó al “Cuervo” Larroque...el de “La Cámpora"", el Jefe de “La Cámpora”...Y ya iban a hablar con Cristina...” (Comunicación del 14/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-14-131007- 12.wav, CD 0025). Cuando aún no se había firmado el acuerdo, Larroque ya intermediaba para evitar complicaciones que pudieran dañar el acercamiento con Teherán. Así, en noviembre de 2012, junto con Luis D'Elía, le solicitó a Khalil que no sumara a los grupos que lidera de la comunidad iraní local a una marcha organizada por partidos de izquierda en defensa de la “causa palestina” y, también, que cesara con los reproches y reclamos, porque ese tipo de acciones podían repercutir en las florecientes relaciones bilaterales. Al respecto, contó Khalil: “...Hoy a la mañana tuve una reunión con la gente del gobierno, me pidieron que por favor no vaya a la reunión... ” y le dijeron: “...Pará la bronca, porque el tema de...puede repercutir en las relaciones que están manteniendo, las conversaciones que estamos teniendo nosotros en Ginebra... ”, en clara alusión a las rondas diplomáticas que gestaron el pacto con Irán. Y agregó: “...Entonces no quiero que ninguno de nosotros, que representa a la República Islámica de una u otra manera... o de la comunidad nuestra...no tiene que ir a ninguno de esos...Ya lo hablé con Larroque y con D'Elía... ” (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2012-11-17-183444- 8, CD 195). Al día siguiente, relató: “...nosotros no estamos haciendo ninguna manifestación acá, porque estamos en plenas negociaciones con el gobierno... a esa reunión la convoqué y o... pero después la tiré para atrás ...porque en base a las negociaciones que se están haciendo entre Irán y Argentina, no queremos vernos inmiscuidos nosotros. Aparte fue un pedido del gobierno. Yo estuve hablando con D'Elía y con el Cuervo Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmití al Safir...y el Safir me dijo lo mismo... 'no hagamos algo que, que pueda molestar” (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18-095153- 16, CD 196). Y le confesó a Esteche: “...el sábado fui a la casa del gordo, hablé con el gordo y el gordo adelante mío lo llamó al cuervo, puso el altavoz...Cuervo, estoy con Yussefbla bla bla...le estoy diciendo que lo que me dijiste que transmita. Así, eh?...”, refiriéndose, respectivamente, a Luis D'Elía y Andrés Larroque (Comunicación del 19/11/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-19-121034-16, CD 197). Toda esta secuencia expone la intervención del Diputado Larroque para, conforme lo necesitaba el plan encubridor de la Dra. Fernández, proteger las negociaciones con Teherán de cualquier tensión innecesaria. Ello, sin perjuicio de otros aportes directos ya mencionados, tendientes al objetivo criminal aquí denunciado. Además, como ya se refirió en acápites previos, Larroque también ha estado en contacto con Fernando Esteche, quien reconoció: “...hoy lo tengo que ver, si, hoy vengo a Capital a verlo a él..”, en alusión al legislador (Comunicación del 19/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2012-11-19-121034-16, CD 197). Tan es así, que en función del vínculo existente entre Esteche y Larroque, Khalil le pidió que lo ayude a construir una relación directa con el diputado (Comunicación del 20/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-20-131705- 12, CD 198). En suma, el Diputado Larroque ha operado, en el marco de este plan, como nexo entre la Sra. Presidente y Luis D'Elía, le ha llevado mensajes e indicaciones al referente de Teherán, Jorge Khalil, y se ha mantenido en comunicaciones con Fernando Esteche en relación al plan encubridor. Un actor clave en la articulación de las comunicaciones y negociaciones que viabilizaron la maniobra denunciada. VII.	- Conclusiones: Durante el desarrollo de la presente denuncia se han explicado en detalle los hechos y se han expuesto múltiples elementos de prueba que demuestran que la Sra. Presidente de la Nación Argentina, Dra. Cristina Elisabet Fernández, emitió una expresa directiva para que se diseñara y ejecutara un plan tendiente a desvincular a los acusados de nacionalidad iraní de la causa por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, a efectos de brindarles impunidad definitiva. Se ha acreditado también que dicha directiva estuvo motivada en la decisión de la primera mandataria de producir un acercamiento de carácter geopolítico como así también de restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal con la República Islámica de Irán, al entender que ello paliaría sustancialmente la crisis energética nacional. Así, los elementos de prueba demostraron que el plan ideado por la Sra. Presidente fue instrumentado principalmente por su canciller, Sr. Héctor Timerman. Que insumió dos años de negociaciones tanto secretas como públicas con autoridades de la República Islámica de Irán, en las cuales las autoridades argentinas dejaron de lado el reclamo de justicia por el caso AMIA y acordaron dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol como un primer paso para desvincular definitivamente de la investigación judicial a todos los acusados iraníes. Uno de los medios elegidos, quizás el más visible pero no el único, para cumplir con ese objetivo convenido de antemano fue el “Memorando de Entendimiento” presentado como el resultado de las negociaciones entre las partes, cuando en realidad, según la prueba obtenida, se trató del instrumento que permite viabilizar la destrucción de las imputaciones contra los acusados iraníes. Se acreditó que dicho Memorando de Entendimiento ha cumplido un papel central en la maniobra de encubrimiento. Fue la vía que esgrimieron los socios del plan criminal para instar la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Además, el documento estaba destinado a garantizar la impunidad de los prófugos iraníes mediante la actuación de la “Comisión de la Verdad”, cuyas conclusiones -como se vio- ya estaban pactadas de antemano. Esta Comisión daría lugar a la nueva hipótesis falsa que, basada en pruebas inventadas, había sido fabricada para reemplazar las acusaciones sostenidas por la pesquisa judicial. Quedó demostrado además que los autores de esta confabulación criminal -Cristina Fernández y Héctor Timerman- fueron secundados por un grupo de partícipes, especialmente elegidos por sus antecedentes y su consustanciación con el plan criminal aquí denunciado. / Quedó clara la participación de Luis Angel D’Elía, Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, Fernando Esteche, del Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, del ex Fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA, Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia y del agente de inteligencia conocido como “Alian”, que las pruebas indican que su verdadero nombre sería Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. Se expusieron, asimismo, los elementos de prueba que acreditaron que tanto la Sra. Presidente de la Nación como el Sr. Canciller efectuaron aportes personales al perfeccionamiento de la maniobra delictiva. AUS& De las contribuciones concretas y específicas de la Sra. Presidente, surgió con claridad que no solamente fue quien decidió la articulación de este plan criminal de impunidad y que se valió de distintos actores para llevar adelante su ejecución, sino que en todo momento estuvo en control de la maniobra, ya sea impartiendo órdenes directas a sus cómplices, o bien encabezando la necesaria campaña discursiva para camuflar la perpetración del delito. Así, ha elegido a algunos de los partícipes del encubrimiento, involucrando directamente a -cuanto menos- uno de sus ministros y a un legislador nacional; ha controlado la evolución del plan en cada paso; ha negociado por interpósitas personas con uno de los prófugos; y se ha involucrado personalmente en algunas acciones de ocultamiento que este sofisticado plan requería. En el caso del Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, se demostró holgadamente que Héctor Timerman ha sido -sin duda alguna- el principal instrumentador del plan de impunidad ideado y ordenado por la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fernández. Desde su función, transmitió a Irán la decisión del gobierno argentino de abandonar el reclamo de justicia en la causa AMIA; acordó la baja de las notificaciones rojas; signó acuerdos secretos con la parte iraní; participó de las negociaciones, de la redacción y de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, pieza central del plan de impunidad. Y se involucró personalmente en la campaña de descrédito y engaño, destinada a destruir la credibilidad de la causa judicial con el fin de, dolosamente, presentar al acuerdo con Irán como la única vía apta para solucionar el caso. Ambos funcionarios actuaron con un único propósito: lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados y el cese de toda actividad jurisdiccional en su contra, para lograr su objetivo último de comerciar libremente a nivel estatal con Irán y acercarse geopolíticamente a Teherán, sin soportar reproche alguno por parte de la opinión pública argentina y mundial. Ello, según surge de la evidencia reunida y sin descartar en modo alguno la existencia de otros motivos adicionales a los aquí expuestos, pero que en nada modifican o disminuyen la criminal responsabilidad de los denunciados. En el cumplimiento de este entramado delictivo han sucedido situaciones realmente alarmantes. Mientras la justicia dedicó y dedica ingentes esfuerzos a lograr la detención y posterior enjuiciamiento de quienes ha señalado “prima facie” como responsables de haber participado en el atentado del 18 de julio de 1994, el Poder Ejecutivo Nacional ha negociado en secreto, justamente con uno de esos imputados, Mohsen Rabbani, la compra y venta de petróleo por granos y, fundamentalmente, su impunidad. Estas acciones han motivado, con justa razón, que se advierta sobre la inaudita gravedad institucional de la maniobra que se denuncia, pues a través del plan criminal no solo se intenta destruir la investigación judicial del mayor atentado terrorista que ha sufrido nuestro país, sino que en la ideación, planificación e instrumentación del delito han participado algunas de las más altas autoridades del gobierno nacional, incluyendo la cabeza del Poder Ejecutivo. En razón de la inusual extensión de la presente denuncia, resulta conveniente reseñar brevemente los puntos más relevantes que han sido probados en esta presentación y que se han tenido en cuenta para formar la convicción acerca de la comisión de un concurso de delitos de acción pública. A saber: •	Que la decisión de la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fernández, de brindarle impunidad a los acusados iraníes y desvincularlos de la investigación por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, estuvo motivada -al menos- en razones de índole geopolítica y comercial. La primera mandataria entendió que el petróleo iraní tendría la capacidad de aliviar la severa crisis energética que viene atravesando el país. Intercambios, a modo de ejemplo, de “granos por petróleo” (sic) fueron vistos como una solución a la situación de emergencia,  'LBERTO FISCAL GENERAL  más allá del interés en acercarse a Teherán, como parte de un nuevo posicionamiento geopolítico en el actual escenario mundial. •	Que estos intereses geopolíticos y comerciales fueron reconocidos por los propios partícipes: “...estamos en otro país, es otra situación mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...” y “...el tema que necesita Argentina, es petróleo...hay un verdadero interés para empezar y entablar las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno, con funcionarios del gobierno de acá, una delegación de allá viajaría o a Caracas o al Golfo o a Beirut mejor ...para empezar las relaciones directas de funcionarios a funcionarios... ”. •	Que la resolución presidencial que pretende alinearse y/o comerciar a nivel estatal con la República Islámica de Irán no es cuestionable judicialmente por tratarse de funciones propias del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional, en tanto conductor de las relaciones exteriores del país. •	Que la opción elegida por la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller para habilitar el mencionado acercamiento geopolítico y la vía comercial fue lo que motivó esta denuncia, por la sencilla y única razón de que optaron por un camino ilegal y delictivo e incurrieron en conductas tipificadas en nuestro Código Penal, al ordenar la diagramación y ejecución de un plan destinado a desvincular definitivamente a los acusados iraníes del caso AMIA. •	Contrario a esta decisión y acciones delictivas, durante la presidencia de Néstor Kirchner se rechazaron rotundamente todos los ofrecimientos de Teherán, siempre destinados a acordar una salida políticamente negociada a esta cuestión, netamente judicial. De ello dieron cuenta varios testimonios coincidentes -del ex Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fernández; de los ex Cancilleres, Rafael Bielsa y Jorge Taiana y del ex Vice Canciller, Roberto García Moritán- que describen los pactos propuestos por Irán y su rechazo por parte del el ex presidente argentino. •	Que el plan pergeñado por Cristina Fernández incluyó el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol -inesperadamente frustrado por el firme accionar del Secretario General Ronald K. Noble-, la firma de un documento jurídico bilateral con capacidad para viabilizar la impunidad de los acusados iraníes, el redireccionamiento fraudulento de la investigación judicial hacia una nueva pista falsa con pruebas inventadas, el desenvolvimiento de una campaña mediática y discursiva para horadar la credibilidad de las conclusiones de la justicia nacional y la manipulación de los familiares de las víctimas, de los sobrevivientes del atentado y de las instituciones comunitarias judías damnificadas por el ataque terrorista de 1994. •	Que dicho plan de impunidad principió en el mes de enero de 2011, en la ciudad siria de Alepo, ocasión en la que el Canciller Timerman le comunicó a su par iraní Ali Akbar Salehi que “Argentina ya no está más interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados...en cambio prefiere mejorar las relaciones económicas con Irán...”. Es la primera vez que un estado agredido implora a un estado agresor que firme un acuerdo por el cual les otorgará impunidad a los agresores. •	Que las tratativas con los representantes de la República Islámica de Irán se mantuvieron en secreto hasta el mes de septiembre de 2012, cuando la Sra. Presidente anunció públicamente el “inicio” de un proceso de negociación con Irán. •	Que una vez oficializadas las reuniones y valiéndose del secreto propio de la actividad diplomática formal, se mantuvo oculto el contenido de las conversaciones, como una necesidad lógica de los •	involucrados de tapar las maniobras delictivas que estaban llevando adelante. •	Que con fecha 27 de enero de 2013 se firmó en el Reino de Etiopía, el Memorando de Entendimiento, lo que vino a confirmar que las negociaciones no habían procurado generar una herramienta para facilitar la cooperación judicial con la causa AMIA y/o la extradición de los imputados, sino que se había redactado un instrumento jurídico, con apariencia de legalidad que viabilizara, a la par de ocultar, la decisión acordada de antemano: la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iraníes. •	Luego de suscribirse el acuerdo, el agente de inteligencia argentino “Alian” le confesó a su par de Irán: “...Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me tenías fe...”, dejando en evidencia que ambas partes han tenido el mismo objetivo criminal. De allí que se compruebe que no se trata, como se presentó públicamente, de dos partes que negocian un acuerdo bilateral, sino de dos socios que participan de un sofisticado plan criminal de impunidad para desligar definitivamente a los prófugos de la causa AMIA de toda relación con el atentado y cerrar toda investigación respecto de ellos. •	Que la ambigüedad, vaguedad y omisión del texto del Memorando de Entendimiento han sido ingredientes relevantes de la ingeniería encubridora aquí denunciada, dado que han dotado al plan criminal de la necesaria flexibilidad jurídica y semántica para que los autores de este encubrimiento puedan adaptar la implementación de sus disposiciones a la aleatoriedad de factores externos y ajenos que eventualmente surjan durante la consecución del plan. Que la intrincada redacción del memorando confirmó la existencia de un trabajo minucioso y pensado al detalle para viabilizar la impunidad. Así quedó establecido el dolo directo con que actuaron los protagonistas del plan que, con pleno conocimiento de la finalidad de sus acciones, buscaron desvincular a los iraníes de las imputaciones por el atentado. •	Que para ello, el Canciller Héctor Timerman se comprometió a dar de baja las notificaciones rojas que pesaban y pesan sobre cinco acusados iraníes. Por tal razón se redactó el punto 7o del Memorando de Entendimiento, único con carácter operativo. La sola firma del pacto habilitó la comunicación a Interpol, con el propósito de que procediera a la inmediata baja de las notificaciones rojas, como fue admitido sin ambages por la diplomacia iraní. •	Que la Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal (Interpol) intervino oportunamente en el caso, garantizando la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas, frustrando, al menos hasta el momento, la promesa asumida por el Sr. Timerman. •	Que tal situación no solo provocó la queja pública del Canciller Iraní, que demandó: “...según el acuerdo firmado por ambos países, la Interpol (Policía Internacional) debe eliminar las acusaciones contra las autoridades iraníes..."", sino que ello también quedó registrado en los canales paralelos de comunicación con Teherán:	.Timerman	no cumplió con algunas cosas. Esto es así de claro. No cumplió con algunas cosas..."". Esto motivó, en Irán, el retiro del acuerdo del trámite parlamentario de aprobación que se había iniciado y hasta la fecha, no se ha notificado oficialmente la ratificación ni ha tenido lugar el intercambio de notas reversales.   •	Que el Canciller Timerman no sólo suscribió el Memorando de Entendimiento, sino que cerró, al menos, dos compromisos secretos e ilegales. Así fue explicado por Khalil, al día siguiente de su regreso de Teherán: “...me parece que el ruso este de mierda [en alusión a Héctor Timerman] se mandó alguna....estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares [en referencia a las notificaciones rojas de Interpol]...” y ratificado, en marzo de 2013, por el entonces Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores iraní, Alí Akbar Salehi: “...El [contenido] del acuerdo entre Irán y Argentina en relación con la cuestión AMIA será hecho público en el momento adecuado...”. No hablaba del Memorando de Entendimiento, sino de otro acuerdo que dos meses después de firmado y publicitado el memorando, aún permanecía en secreto. Y en este marco deben entenderse también otras manifestaciones de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, cuando comentando noticias periodísticas que difundían que el ex Ministro de Defensa iraní, Ahmad Vahidi, nunca sería interrogado pese a estar incluido en el Memorando, aseguró que ese tema en particular “estaba conversado antes ....estaba dentro del marco” y que el acuerdo “es más profundo todavía”. •	Que el Memorando de Entendimiento prevé otros mecanismos para lograr la impunidad de los acusados. La “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en el acuerdo ha sido creada para desacreditar la investigación llevada a cabo por la justicia argentina y legitimar una nueva y falsa versión de los hechos, fabricada para redireccionar la pesquisa hacia otros imputados, con el objeto de desvincular a los iraníes. Así lo han reconocido los encubridores: “...alguien va a salir con la cara manchada de acá...eso ya está arreglado... ¿Cómo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo? Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa...”. •	Que la impunidad se acordó en forma previa a la firma del Memorando e incluyó la elaboración de una hipótesis alternativa con pruebas falsas para desviar en forma fraudulenta la investigación judicial a terceros, desincriminando a los iraníes. En referencia a ello, en una fecha tan temprana como diciembre de 2012, Esteche aseveró: “...quieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla... ”. Y de la conversación se desprende que esa tarea quedó a cargo de funcionarios de la Secretaría de Inteligencia, especialmente designados para esta tarea. Al respecto, también se dijo: “...va a venir otra hipótesis, con otras pruebas...” y se especulaba que el suscripto, Fiscal de la causa por el atentado a la AMIA quedara “...culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas, lo que viene ahora...”. •	Que los pasos y avances locales del plan fueron comunicados en tiempo real tanto a las autoridades iraníes en Teherán como a uno de los prófugos de la causa AMIA, Mohsen Rabbani, quien aún ostenta un enorme poder decisorio dentro del régimen iraní y ha sido informado permanentemente de la marcha de su propio encubrimiento. •	Que la circunstancia de que las autoridades iraníes hayan estado al tanto de lo que resolvía y decidía el gobierno argentino, volvió a demostrar que el acuerdo, lejos de haber contribuido con la causa, como falsamente se proclamó, fue un disfraz jurídico de un acuerdo ilegal previo y mucho más amplio. •	Que la influencia del imputado Rabbani ha desembocado en un hecho penoso. La negociación activa de los funcionarios nacionales aquí acusados con uno de los prófugos a los que estaban, en simultáneo, encubriendo. Es decir, mientras la justicia dedicaba esfuerzos para lograr la detención y posterior enjuiciamiento de aquellas personas señaladas como responsables por el atentado, la Dra. Cristina Fernández y su Canciller, a través de interpósitas personas negociaban con unos de los principales acusados, Mohsen Rabbani, la compra de petróleo y su impunidad. Según dijo el nombrado: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que estas listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina...y también comprar armas...’’'’ •	Que de forma paralela y para facilitar el avance del encubrimiento la Dra. Cristina Fernández y el Sr. Héctor Timerman desplegaron verdaderas campañas de desprestigio, engaño y manipulación mediante la articulación de una artillería de mentiras, falacias, puestas en escena y secretos con el fin de ocultar las intenciones criminales y facilitar la ejecución del plan de impunidad. •	Que ambos funcionarios mintieron al negar que el acercamiento con Teherán estuviera motivado en razones comerciales o geopolíticas. Mintieron también cuando aseguraron que el Memorando de Entendimiento solo buscaba verdad y justicia. Cuando dijeron que la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas no estaba en peligro. Cuando expresaron que la causa estaba paralizada. Cuando aseveraron que se firmaría un anexo al pacto y luego lo negaron. Cuando aseguraron que no iban a permitir que el caso AMIA se transformara en una pieza de ajedrez en la geopolítica mundial. Cuando dijeron que no existían acuerdos o cláusulas secretas, entre muchas otras falsedades que fueron señaladas a lo largo de esta denuncia. •	Quizás la más dolorosa de las mentiras tuvo como protagonista a la Sra. Presidente, quién públicamente le aseguró a los sobrevivientes del atentado y a los familiares de las víctimas, que los consultaría frente a cualquier propuesta que realizara Teherán, previo a tomar alguna decisión. No sólo jamás hubo consulta alguna sino que los familiares debieron enterarse de la firma del pacto bilateral por los medios de comunicación. En cambio, el Sr. D'Elía, activamente involucrado en el plan criminal, fue informado de inmediato y de manera personal por el entonces Secretario General de Presidencia de la Nación, Oscar Parrilli. •	Que las actuaciones de la Sra. Presidente y del Sr. Canciller incluyeron también una puesta en escena verificada los días 27 y 28 de septiembre de 2013, ocasión en la que públicamente se informó sobre una reunión entre los cancilleres argentino e iraní, mientras que subrepticiamente autores y partícipes del plan coordinaban en secreto las declaraciones y acciones posteriores, para engañar a la opinión pública y permitir que el plan criminal siguiera su marcha. El operador y partícipe de este plan Luis D’Elía especificó el pedido: “. ..tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar allá urgente [en referencia a Irán], antes de mañana...Estoy en la casa de gobierno ahora... no hay asunto más importante que este, créemelo ....necesito que hables con el Sheik de allá [en referencia a Rabbani] mira que es muy groso lo que tengo eh!...”. La Sra. Presidente buscaba obtener ciertos pronunciamientos por parte de Teherán, funcionales al plan de impunidad. •	Que la realidad, como se acreditó a lo largo de la presentación, demostró ser diametralmente opuesta a lo declamado públicamente por la Dra. Fernández y el Sr. Timerman. Su engaño fue premeditado y sus aportes han sido centrales en el plan delictivo. Tan es así que los cómplices del plan han asegurado que todo estaba “cerrado muy arriba”, todo había sido decidido “al más alto nivel” porque “lo pidió la jefa” y su canciller, obediente, implemento el plan porque fue “orden, orden y orden"". La evidencia reunida así lo demuestra. •	Que también en forma paralela y para facilitar el plan de impunidad, se establecieron mecanismos de apoyo y protección a los referentes de Irán en Argentina, producto de lo que se había acordado. Éstos, conscientes de ello, afirmaron “el gobierno ahora está a favor “...el gobierno banca...'1'' y “...Nosotros estamos ante un acuerdo con el gobierno nacional ...atrás de una negociación con el gobierno nacional...”. •	Que este plan de encubrimiento e impunidad contó con la colaboración indispensable de un grupo de individuos cuyas funciones y aportes viabilizaron el éxito del plan. •	Que Luis D’Elía, acérrimo defensor del régimen iraní y “soldado” incondicional de la Presidente -como él se ha definido- fue el sujeto elegido para la transmisión y recepción de mensajes clandestinos a Irán. En sus palabras: “...Yo tengo que hacer el juego de la Rosada...Si tengo orden de no ir, soy un soldado acá...”. D’Elía fue, en este plan, el interlocutor oculto y válido de las autoridades gubernamentales argentinas para resolver los obstáculos que iba presentando el “iter criminis”. Consustanciado ideológicamente con ambas partes del pacto delictivo, estuvo varias veces en Irán. En una ocasión, invitado por el régimen, le ofrecieron un acuerdo similar al que luego firmó Timerman, que ya incluía el cese de las notificaciones rojas. En todas sus visitas a Irán, se entrevistó con altas autoridades del régimen, se fotografió -entre otros- con el prófugo Mohsen Rabbani, con quien está relacionado hace años. •	Que su correlato del lado iraní fue Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, máximo referente local del régimen, “la voz y oídos de Irán” en nuestro país, incluso con mayor poder real que el ex Encargado de Negocios de Irán. Militante a tiempo completo de los intereses persas, cumplió idénticas funciones que D’Elía en la transmisión de mensajes a través de los canales paralelos de comunicación y negociación, operando -de ese modo- como el referente de la diplomacia paralela que comunica Buenos Aires con Teherán, que fue aprovechada para la consecución del plan de impunidad. •	Que el funcionario de inteligencia con acceso al entorno presidencial conocido como “Alian”, con información privilegiada -incluso sobre la salud de la Sra. Presidente-, ha declarado su simpatía con el régimen iraní y ha actuado -en reiteradas ocasiones- a favor de intereses extranjeros en detrimento de los nacionales. Funcionó como nexo entre la Sra. Presidente y el referente local de Irán, Jorge Khalil, e impulsó desde las sombras y siguiendo órdenes de sus superiores, las acciones que aportaron al plan de impunidad. Explicó lo que se podía hacer y lo que no, lo que convenía y lo que podría molestar. Explicó también los pasos del gobierno, reveló información sensible y secreta a agentes al servicio de una potencia extranjera, como Khalil, y viabilizó la ejecución del encubrimiento, participando, en especial, en el armado de la nueva hipótesis criminal, para desplazar la versión sostenida por la justicia nacional, en base a las pruebas de la causa, que señala la responsabilidad de ciudadanos iraníes. •	Que el ex Fiscal designado, el día del atentado, para actuar en forma conjunta, alterna o sucesiva en la causa AMIA, Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia, en razón de sus conocimientos detallados del expediente y su experiencia en la práctica judicial en materia penal, por haberse desempeñado además como Juez de la Nación, aportó valiosa información y consejos técnicos para el armado de esta nueva hipótesis falsa, de modo de tornarla verosímil y adaptable a la realidad de una causa judicial, que conocía por haber intervenido en su condición de Fiscal Federal. •	Que Femando Esteche fue un facilitador del plan criminal, que contribuyó activamente a encaminar las negociaciones en los canales paralelos. También fue Esteche quien acercó a Khalil a los funcionarios de inteligencia argentinos, permitiendo que se genere una importante vía de contacto directo entre los agentes de ambos países. Fue él quien sumó al Dr. Yrimia al plan, con todo lo que ello redundó en el perfeccionamiento de la pista falsa para redireccionar la investigación, a la que -además- aportó ideas concretas. •	Que el Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, contacto directo y asiduo con la Sra. Presidente de la Nación, por su cercanía y confianza fue elegido para cumplir el rol de nexo transmisor de las decisiones presidenciales a los ejecutores del plan criminal, a sabiendas de lo delictivas que eran. Se acreditaron distintos episodios en los que Larroque bajó estas directivas presidenciales, tanto a Khalil como a D'Elía, sobre cómo debían actuar. Como por ejemplo, la ocasión en que, en noviembre de 2012, Khalil reconoció: “...vengo de La Matanza recién he tenido una reunión con Luis D'Elía y el “Cuervo ” Larroque, el de la Cámpora...que me llamaron temprano que querían hablar conmigo, que tenían un mensaje para el gobierno para dar... Y ahora me voy para Martínez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador...”. Su intervención ha sido indispensable para evitar, por precaución, un contacto directo entre autores y partícipes del encubrimiento. Las conclusiones expuestas no son otras que las que razonable y lógicamente se derivan de un minucioso y detallado análisis de la prueba colectada. Conforme habrá podido apreciarse a lo largo de la denuncia, en la gran mayoría de los casos, dichas conclusiones surgen de prueba directa, mientras que en otros son el resultado de una serie de indicios y rigurosas deducciones lógicas que, por ser graves, inequívocos, precisos y concordantes con el resto de los elementos probatorios, contribuyen a solidificar la denuncia que se presenta. De este modo, se exponen las acciones inescrupulosas y delictivas de autores y partícipes del encubrimiento que han vulnerado el derecho vigente, han ultrajado la memoria de las víctimas, han lucrado políticamente con esas muertes y han abusado de la paciencia y buena fe de los sobrevivientes del atentado y familiares de las víctimas que buscan y esperan lo que, en definitiva, merecen: que se castigue con el máximo rigor de la ley a los responsables de este tenebroso acto de terrorismo. VII.	- Breves consideraciones normativas Ahora bien, conforme ya ha sido adelantado, el plan delictivo aquí denunciado encuadra, a priori, en las figuras penales de encubrimiento por favorecimiento personal agravado, impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional e incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionario público (arts. 277 inciso 1 y 3, 241 inciso 2 y 248 del Código Penal). En primer lugar, cabe señalar que el encubrimiento por favorecimiento personal (art. 277 inc. 1) se encuentra agravado respecto de algunos de los encartados, por su calidad de funcionarios públicos (art. 277 inc. 3o d); y -en todos los casos- por la especial gravedad del hecho precedente (art. 277 inc. 3o a). Como es sabido y aunque se configuran varias agravantes, éstas no concurren entre sí e imperará aquella que contenga -según el caso- mayores elementos de especialidad y abarque una mayor protección del bien jurídico tratado.   Ministerio Público de la Nación En segundo lugar, y solo en los casos de imputados que revistan la calidad de funcionarios públicos, una o varias de las acciones atribuidas son confígurativas del tipo penal previsto en el art. 248 del código de fondo, en virtud de los deberes funcionales específicos de cada cargo que fueron desatendidos en el curso del plan criminal. Ello, sin perjuicio, de la ulterior aplicación de la normativa concursal vigente. En tercer lugar, se entiende que la acción delictiva aquí individualizada y denunciada, encuadra también en la figura de impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional (art. 241 inc. 2 del Código Penal), dado que constituye un atentado contra la libertad en el ejercicio de la función pública, en el caso, de la actividad jurisdiccional en torno al caso AMIA. El normal desenvolvimiento de esa actividad desplegada por el juez Rodolfo Canicoba Corral y de la investigación del atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, que constituye el objeto procesal de la causa, se ve - cuanto menos- estorbada por la ejecución de un plan destinado a encubrir en el citado expediente a un grupo de imputados acusados de participar en el referido hecho de terrorismo. Más aún, desde el momento en que se suscribió el acuerdo con Irán, a esta altura ya se sabe, un instrumento cardinal en la maniobra de encubrimiento, se consumaron serias afectaciones al normal desenvolvimiento de los intercambios de información, elementos y demás piezas probatorias relevantes para la pesquisa del caso “AMIA”, implementados a través de los mecanismos de cooperación judicial internacional. El acuerdo firmado con Irán se traduce en restricciones y serias afectaciones a la recepción de información y documentación probatoria aportada por terceros estados para ser agregada al expediente judicial. Como bien se sabe, el acuerdo con la República Islámica incluye, entre sus disposiciones, la obligación de entregar la totalidad de las actuaciones en trámite ante la justicia argentina -no a los imputados, lo que corresponde por derecho- para su revisión por parte de la “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en el convenio, para su posterior comunicación al gobierno de la República Islámica de Irán. Justamente, la eventual puesta en conocimiento de las autoridades iraníes de informaciones, investigaciones, revelaciones y/o conclusiones elaboradas por organismos y/o agencias extranjeras, constituye una severa perturbación a dichos canales internacionales que nutren a la causa de elementos probatorios de interés, lo que claramente se erige en una traba que opera en detrimento de la investigación. Habida cuenta que en la presente denuncia se encuentra involucrada una persona que, conforme a las probanzas reunidas, pertenece a la Secretaría de Inteligencia, y que en tal carácter ha tenido participación activa en los hechos delictivos aquí verificados; corresponde requerir al Sr. Secretario de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación que autorice el acceso a la totalidad de la información respecto de esta persona (arts. 16 y 17 de la Ley 25.520). VII.	- Medidas cautelares a)	Embargo Preventivo: En virtud de la gran cantidad de elementos de convicción que sustentan la presente denuncia, la extensión del daño causado por el delito y la multiplicidad de víctimas afectadas, se impone requerir al Sr. Juez el dictado de un embargo preventivo sobre los bienes de autores y partícipes de este encubrimiento de un crimen de lesa humanidad para asegurar la indemnización del daño material y moral causado a las víctimas y a sus familias (art. 29 del Código Penal) que una eventual - y en este caso, probable- sentencia condenatoria necesariamente deberá ordenar. Por lo demás, la medida cautelar solicitada impedirá que cualquiera de los   Ministerio Público de la Nación uberto nism/n FISCAL GENERAL/ imputados practique, durante el proceso, maniobras destinadas a insolventarse y, de ese modo, eludir sus obligaciones jurídicas. Efectivamente, el código ritual ha previsto de forma expresa la situación fáctica aquí planteada en su art. 518 al establecer: “Al dictar el auto de procesamiento, el juez ordenará el embargo de bienes del imputado...” para agregar en su parte final: “...las medidas cautelares podrán dictarse antes del auto de procesamiento, cuando hubiere peligro en la demora y elementos de convicción suficientes que las justifiquen”. Es decir, la ley autoriza la imposición de medidas cautelares de índole económica, como el embargo preventivo, antes del dictado del auto de procesamiento. En esos casos exige la concurrencia de dos requisitos para su procedencia: que haya elementos de convicción que la justifiquen y que exista peligro en la demora. El primer requisito se encuentra ampliamente verificado a partir de los sólidos elementos probatorios aportados en la presente denuncia que da cuenta del comportamiento delictivo de los imputados quienes, conforme se ha demostrado, han realizado todo tipo de maniobras destinadas a destruir las imputaciones de la causa AMIA poniendo en ejecución un sofisticado plan de encubrimiento cuyo objetivo es lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iraníes, violentando el derecho de las víctimas y sus familiares a lograr justicia. La segunda exigencia -peligro en la demora- se encuentra acreditada por la naturaleza extraordinaria del hecho ilícito denunciado, la entidad de los bienes jurídicos afectados y la falta total de escrúpulos de los sujetos aquí denunciados, lo que obliga al Sr. Juez a extremar los recaudos para evitar que nuevas maniobras y/o ardides dirigidos a la insolvencia personal de autores y partícipes de este delito perjudiquen nuevamente a las víctimas. Así, la demora en la aplicación de la medida cautelar requerida tornaría incierto o incluso ilusorio el derecho a compensación de las víctimas que supone una reparación plena y efectiva, además de apropiada y proporcional a la gravedad de la lesión. Es decir, cabe asumir con un alto grado de certeza que aquellas personas que no trepidaron en ejecutar un plan criminal de encubrimiento para destruir la investigación principal por el atentado a la AMIA, hagan lo propio para salvaguardar sus patrimonios personales, escapando así a las responsabilidades económicas derivadas de la comisión del delito denunciado. Así, el cúmulo probatorio que sustenta la presente denuncia justifica, por su propia solidez,	la	aplicación	de la medida	cautelar solicitada. En cuanto al monto	a	embargar,	más allá del	carácter preventivo de la medida, lo cierto	es	que según	la manda legal	debe ser suficiente para garantizar la pena pecuniaria, la indemnización civil y las costas. En esa inteligencia para	establecer la	suma resarcitoria debe atenderse tanto a la gravedad del hecho perpetrado, a la trascendencia institucional que reviste como al significativo número de víctimas, teniéndose en cuenta el daño efectivo sufrido más el daño moral provocado por el delito. En razón que resulta necesario efectuar una reparación integral por el daño causado, la multiplicidad de víctimas que se encuentran en posición de reclamar un resarcimiento por sus derechos afectados resulta determinante al momento de ponderar el monto del embargo. Nótese que existe una relación directa entre el delito y la denegación de justicia; que su duración ya ha consumido, solo hasta el momento, 18 largos meses; y que algunas de las personas involucradas en la maniobra tienen una altísima jerarquía institucional en el gobierno nacional. Estos parámetros han de ser tomados en consideración para calibrar adecuadamente la suma por la cual deben responder los acusados que, si bien resulta ser insusceptible de apreciación pecuniaria objetiva, es el único modo aceptado de reparación frente a la angustia, la desesperanza y la impotencia de quienes tienen que soportar un nuevo encubrimiento en la investigación del atentado contra la AMIA.   En atención a que la obligación de resarcir el daño provocado es solidaria entre todos los responsables, entiendo adecuado la imposición de la suma de $200.000.000 (doscientos millones de pesos). b)	Prohibición de salida del país: A los efectos de asegurar desde el inicio los fines del proceso, corresponde solicitar que V.S. decrete la inmediata prohibición de salir del país de Luis Ángel D'Elía, Fernando Luis Esteche, Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil y Héctor Luis Yrimia. El mismo temperamento corresponde adoptar respecto de “Alian”, quien deberá ser correctamente individualizado y que, según los indicios obtenidos hasta el momento, podría tratarse de Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. En relación a los restantes imputados en esta presentación - Cristina Elisabet Fernández, Héctor Marcos Timerman y Andrés Larroque-, teniendo en cuenta los altos cargos públicos que ejercen, como así también los fueros de los se encuentran investidos, a juicio del suscripto, no se advierten -por el momento- circunstancias que ameriten asegurar su sujeción al proceso mediante esta medida. Ello, sin perjuicio de que el criterio aquí articulado pueda modificarse, conforme a derecho. Por lo demás, la gravedad institucional de esta denuncia, en tanto involucra a un Presidente de la Nación y a un Ministro del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional en ejercicio y a otros funcionarios de alta jerarquía dentro del gobierno nacional, no debe -sin embargo- convertirse en obstáculo para la investigación judicial y el desempeño de las tareas propias de un Poder Judicial independiente, máxime teniendo en cuenta la seriedad de los hechos aquí anoticiados. Muy por el contrario, la celeridad para aclarar estos graves hechos, resulta imperativa. Finalmente, se entiende corresponde formular la presente denuncia ante el Juzgado Nacional en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal N°4 a cargo del Dr. Ariel Lijo, quien ya se encuentra interviniendo en relación con hechos e irregularidades pasadas de esta investigación, que también involucran falsas acusaciones para direccionar erróneamente la pesquisa y/o el encubrimiento de imputados para su protección. Esas investigaciones, que tramitaron y -en parte aún tramitan- ante el Juzgado del Dr. Lijo, tienen identidad procesal con los hechos que aquí se denuncian, en tanto también se refieren a actividades destinadas a encubrir a imputados por el atentado, aun cuando hayan sido desplegadas por distintos sujetos activos y en distintos momentos de la tramitación de la pesquisa. Lo cierto es que en ambos casos, se trata de maniobras delictivas destinadas a entorpecer la investigación judicial por el atentado contra la AMIA. En este sentido, corresponde tener presente que el Ministerio Público Fiscal es un órgano independiente, con autonomía funcional y autarquía financiera, que tiene por función promover la actuación de la justicia en defensa de la legalidad y de los intereses generales de la sociedad (art. 120 de la Constitución Nacional y Ley Nacional N° 24.946) y, en cumplimiento de esos mandatos funcionales y de lo normado en el art. 177 inc. Io del Código Procesal Penal, vengo a formular la presente denuncia, por considerar que los hechos aquí expuestos encuentran “prima facie” adecuación jurídica en las figuras de encubrimiento por favorecimiento personal agravado, impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional e incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionario público, previstas en los arts. 277 inc. 1 y 3, 241 inc. 2 y 248 del Código Penal. X- Petitorio; Por todo lo expuesto, solicito al Sr. Juez que: I.	-	Se tenga por formulada la presente denuncia en virtud del mandato dispuesto en el art. 177 inc. Io del Código Procesal Penal de la Nación y que le dé curso, conforme el procedimiento previsto en el citado cuerpo legal. II.	-	Se tome razón de lo dispuesto en el punto VIII in fine, en los términos de los arts. 16 y 17 de la ley 25.520, a los fines que VS. estime correspondan.   Vil.- Se reciba.declaración indagatoria, conforme lo normado en el art. 29 í c oi Código Procesal Penal de la Nación a Cristina Eiisabet Fernández., Héctor Marcos Timerman, Luis Ángel D’Elía, Femando Luis Estech . crg>; Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, Héctor Luis Yrimia. Andrés Larroque y r.’ sujeto identificado como “Alian” que, según los indicios obtenidos hasta (! ...omento, podría tratarse de Ramón Héctor Alian Bogado. YIII.- Se trabe embargo preventivo respecto de Cristina Eiisabet Fernández. Hécor Marcos Timerman, Femando Luis Esteche, Luis Angel D’Elír, Héctor Luis Yrimia, Jorge Alejandro Khalíl y Andrés Larroque, hasta cubrir la suma de doscientos millones de pesos ($ 200.000.000), en forma solidaria, en aplicación de lo normado en el art. 518 del Código Procesal fonal de la Nación, lo que así expresamente se solicita al Sr. Juez.

Two wail. A bamboo grove, all chopped down From it, warring songs ....IS THE BEST THAT CORPORAL BOBBY SHAFTOE CAN DO ON short notice--he's standing on the running board, gripping his Springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other, so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question.  Is ``tires'' one syllable or two?  How about ``wail?'' The truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over, and thuds back onto four wheels. The wail--and the moment--are lost. Bobby can still hear the coolies singing, though, and now too there's the gunlike snicking of the truck's clutch linkage as Private Wiley downshifts. Could Wiley be losing his nerve? And, in the back, under the tarps, a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking, code books slaloming, fuel spanking the tanks of Station Alpha's electrical generator. The modern world's hell on haiku writers: ``Electrical generator'' is, what, eight syllables? You couldn't even fit that onto the second line! ""Are we allowed to run over people?'' Private Wiley inquires, and then mashes the horn button before Bobby Shaftoe can answer. A Sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart. Shaftoe's gut reaction is: Sure, what're they going to do, declare war on us? but as the highest-ranking man on this truck he's probably supposed to be using his head or something, so he doesn't blurt it out just yet. He takes stock of the situation: Shanghai, 1645 hours, Friday, the 28th of November 1941. Bobby Shaftoe, and the other half-dozen Marines on his truck, are staring down the length of Kiukiang Road, onto which they've just made this careening high-speed turn. Cathedral's going by to the right, so that means they are, what? two blocks away from the Bund. A Yangtze River Patrol gunboat is tied up there, waiting for the stuff they've got in the back of this truck. The only real problem is that those particular two blocks are inhabited by about five million Chinese people. Now these Chinese are sophisticated urbanites, not suntanned yokels who've never seen cars before--they'll get out of your way if you drive fast and honk your horn. And indeed many of them flee to one side of the street or the other, producing the illusion that the truck its moving faster than the forty-three miles an hour shown on its speedometer. But the bamboo grove in Bobby Shaftoe's haiku has not been added just to put a little Oriental flavor into the poem and wow the folks back home in Oconomowoc. There is a lot of heavy bamboo in front of this truck, dozens of makeshift turnpikes blocking their path to the river, for the officers of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, and of the Fourth Marines, who dreamed up this little operation forgot to take the Friday Afternoon factor into account. As Bobby Shaftoe could've explained to them, if only they'd bothered to ask a poor dumb jarhead, their route took them through the heart of the banking district. Here you've got the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank of course, City Bank, Chase Manhattan, the Bank of America, and BBME and the Agricultural Bank of China and any number of crappy little provincial banks, and several of those banks have contracts with what's left of the Chinese Government to print currency. It must be a cutthroat business because they slash costs by printing it on old newspapers, and if you know how to read Chinese, you can see last year's news stories and polo scores peeking through the colored numbers and pictures that transform these pieces of paper into legal tender. As every chicken-peddler and rickshaw operator in Shanghai knows, the money-printing contracts stipulate that all of the bills these banks print have to be backed by such-and-such an amount of silver; i.e., anyone should be able to walk into one of those banks at the end of Kiukiang Road and slap down a pile of bills and (provided that those bills were printed by that same bank) receive actual metallic silver in exchange. Now if China weren't right in the middle of getting systematically drawn and quartered by the Empire of Nippon, it would probably send official bean counters around to keep tabs on how much silver was actually present in these banks' vaults, and it would all be quiet and orderly. But as it stands, the only thing keeping these banks honest is the other banks. Here's how they do it: during the normal course of business, lots of paper money will pass over the counters of (say) Chase Manhattan Bank. They'll take it into a back room and sort it, throwing into money boxes (a couple of feet square and a yard deep, with ropes on the four corners) all of the bills that were printed by (say) Bank of America in one, all of the City Bank bills into another. Then, on Friday afternoon they will bring in coolies. Each coolie, or pair of coolies, will of course have his great big long bamboo pole with him--a coolie without his pole is like a China Marine without his nickel-plated bayonet--and will poke their pole through the ropes on the corners of the box. Then one coolie will get underneath each end of the pole, hoisting the box into the air. They have to move in unison or else the box begins flailing around and everything gets out of whack. So as they head towards their destination--whatever bank whose name is printed on the bills in their box--they sing to each other, and plant their feet on the pavement in time to the music. The pole's pretty long, so they are that far apart, and they have to sing loud to hear each other, and of course each pair of coolies in the street is singing their own particular song, trying to drown out all of the others so that they don't get out of step. So ten minutes before closing time on Friday afternoon, the doors of many banks burst open and numerous pairs of coolies march in singing, like the curtain-raiser on a fucking Broadway musical, slam their huge boxes of tattered currency down, and demand silver in exchange. All of the banks do this to each other. Sometimes, they'll all do it on the same Friday, particularly at times like 28 November 1941, when even a grunt like Bobby Shaftoe can understand that it's better to be holding silver than piles of old cut-up newspaper. And that is why, once the normal pedestrians and food-cart operators and furious Sikh cops have scurried out of the way, and plastered themselves up against the clubs and shops and bordellos on Kiukiang Road, Bobby Shaftoe and the other Marines on the truck still cannot even see the gunboat that is their destination, because of this horizontal forest of mighty bamboo poles. They cannot even hear the honking of their own truck horn because of the wild throbbing pentatonic cacophony of coolies singing. This ain't just your regular Friday P.M. Shanghai bank-district money-rush. This is an ultimate settling of accounts before the whole Eastern Hemisphere catches fire. The millions of promises printed on those slips of bumwad will all be kept or broken in the next ten minutes; actual pieces of silver and gold will move, or they won't. It is some kind of fiduciary Judgment Day. ``Jesus Christ, I can't--'' Private Wiley hollers. ""The captain said don't stop for any reason whatsofuckinever,'' Shaftoe reminds him. He's not telling Wiley to run over the coolies, he's reminding Wiley that if he refrains from running over them, they will have some explaining to do--which will be complicated by the fact that the captain's right behind them in a car stuffed with Tommy Gun-toting China Marines. And from the way the captain's been acting about this Station Alpha thing, it's pretty clear that he already has a few preliminary strap marks on his ass, courtesy of some admiral in Pearl Harbor or even (drumroll) Marine Barracks, Eight and Eye Streets Southeast, Washington, D.C. Shaftoe and the other Marines have always known Station Alpha as a mysterious claque of pencil-necked swabbies who hung out on the roof of a building in the International Settlement in a shack of knot-pocked cargo pallet planks with antennas sticking out of it every which way. If you stood there long enough you could see some of those antennas moving, zeroing in on something out to sea. Shaftoe even wrote a haiku about it: Antenna searches Retriever's nose in the wind Ether's far secrets This was only his second haiku ever--clearly not up to November 1941 standards--and he cringes to remember it. But in no way did any of the Marines comprehend what a big deal Station Alpha was until today. Their job had turned out to involve wrapping a ton of equipment and several tons of paper in tarps and moving it out of doors. Then they spent Thursday tearing the shack apart, making it into a bonfire, and burning certain books and papers. ``Sheeeyit!'' Private Wiley hollers. Only a few of the coolies have gotten out of the way, or even seen them. But then there is this fantastic boom from the river, like the sound of a mile-thick bamboo pole being snapped over God's knee. Half a second later there're no coolies in the street anymore--just a lot of boxes with unmanned bamboo poles teeter-tottering on them, bonging into the streets like wind-chimes. Above, a furry mushroom of grey smoke rises from the gunboat. Wiley shifts up to high gear and floors it. Shaftoe cringes against the truck's door and lowers his head, hoping that his campy Great War doughboy helmet will be good for something. Then money-boxes start to rupture and explode as the truck rams through them. Shaftoe peers up through a blizzard of notes and sees giant bamboo poles soaring and bounding and windmilling toward the waterfront. The leaves of Shanghai: Pale doorways in a steel sky. Winter has begun. BARRENS Let's set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume, and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other, either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves, or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed, and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever, but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage, Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born, in Murdo, South Dakota, to Blanche, the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo--which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead. As nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet. In the tradition of his namesake (the Puritan writer John Bunyan, who spent much of his life in jail, or trying to avoid it) the Rev. Waterhouse did not preach in any one place for long. The church moved him from one small town in the Dakotas to another every year or two. It is possible that Godfrey found the lifestyle more than a little alienating, for, sometime during the course of his studies at Fargo Congregational College, he bolted from the fold and, to the enduring agony of his parents, fell into worldy pursuits, and ended up, somehow, getting a Ph.D. in Classics from a small private university in Ohio. Academics being no less nomadic than Congregational preachers, he took work where he could find it. He became a Professor of Greek and Latin at Bolger Christian College (enrollment 322) in West Point, Virginia, where the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers came together to form the estuarial James, and the loathsome fumes of the big paper mill permeated every drawer, every closet, even the interior pages of books. Godfrey's young bride, nee Alice Pritchard, who had grown up following her itinerant-preacher father across the vastnesses of eastern Montana--where air smelt of snow and sage--threw up for three months. Six months later she gave birth to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse. The boy had a peculiar relationship with sound. When a fire engine passed, he was not troubled by the siren's howl or the bell's clang. But when a hornet got into the house and swung across the ceiling in a broad Lissajous, droning almost inaudibly, he cried in pain at the noise. And if he saw or smelled something that scared him, he would clap his hands over his ears. One noise that troubled him not at all was the pipe organ in the chapel at Bolger Christian College. The chapel itself was nothing worth mentioning, but the organ had been endowed by the paper mill family and would have sufficed for a church four times the size. It nicely complemented the organist, a retired high school math teacher who felt that certain attributes of the Lord (violence and capriciousness in the Old Testament, majesty and triumph in the New) could be directly conveyed into the souls of the enpewed sinners through a kind of frontal sonic impregnation. That he ran the risk of blowing out the stained-glass windows was of no consequence since no one liked them anyway, and the paper mill fumes were gnawing at the interstitial lead. But after one little old lady too many staggered down the aisle after a service, reeling from tinnitus, and made a barbed comment to the minister about the exceedingly dramatic music, the organist was replaced. Nevertheless, he continued to give lessons on the instrument. Students were not allowed to touch the organ until they were proficient at the piano, and when this was explained to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, he taught himself, in three weeks, how to play a Bach fugue, and signed up for organ lessons. Since he was only five years old at the time, he was unable to reach both the manuals and the pedals, and had to play standing--or rather strolling, from pedal to pedal. When Lawrence was twelve, the organ broke down. That paper mill family had not left any endowment for maintenance, so the math teacher decided to have a crack at it. He was in poor health and required a nimble assistant: Lawrence, who helped him open up the hood of the thing. For the first time in all those years, the boy saw what had been happening when he had been pressing those keys. For each stop--each timbre, or type of sound, that the organ could make (viz. blockflote, trumpet, piccolo)--there was a separate row of pipes, arranged in a line from long to short. Long pipes made low notes, short high. The tops of the pipes defined a graph: not a straight line but an upward-tending curve. The organist/math teacher sat down with a few loose pipes, a pencil, and paper, and helped Lawrence figure out why. When Lawrence understood, it was as if the math teacher had suddenly played the good part of  Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor  on a pipe organ the size of the Spiral Nebula in Andromeda--the part where Uncle Johann dissects the architecture of the Universe in one merciless descending ever-mutating chord, as if his foot is thrusting through skidding layers of garbage until it finally strikes bedrock. In particular, the final steps of the organist's explanation were like a falcon's dive through layer after layer of pretense and illusion, thrilling or sickening or confusing depending on what you were. The heavens were riven open. Lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels ranking off into geometrical infinity. The pipes sprouted in parallel ranks from a broad flat box of compressed air. All of the pipes for a given note--but belonging to different stops--lined up with each other along one axis. All of the pipes for a given stop--but tuned at different pitches--lined up with each other along the other, perpendicular axis. Down there in the flat box of air, then, was a mechanism that got air to the right pipes at the right times. When a key or pedal was depressed, all of the pipes capable of sounding the corresponding note would speak, as long as their stops were pulled out. Mechanically, all of this was handled in a fashion that was perfectly clear, simple, and logical. Lawrence had supposed that the machine must be at least as complicated as the most intricate fugue that could be played on it. Now he had learned that a machine, simple in its design, could produce results of infinite complexity. Stops were rarely used alone. They tended to be piled on top of each other in combinations that were designed to take advantage of the available harmonics (more tasty mathematics here!). Certain combinations in particular were used over and over again. Lots of blockflo[autes, in varying lengths, for the quiet Offertory, for example. The organ included an ingenious mechanism called the preset, which enabled the organist to select a particular combination of stops--stops he himself had chosen--instantly. He would punch a button and several stops would bolt out from the console, driven by pneumatic pressure, and in that instant the organ would become a different instrument with entirely new timbres. The next summer both Lawrence and Alice, his mother, were colonized by a distant cousin--a stupendous badass of a virus. Lawrence escaped from it with an almost imperceptible tendency to drag one of his feet. Alice wound up in an iron lung. Later, unable to cough effectively, she got pneumonia and died. Lawrence's father Godfrey freely confessed that he was not equal to the burdens now laid on his shoulders. He resigned from his position at the small college in Virginia and moved, with his son, to a small house in Moorhead, Minnesota, next door to where Bunyan and Blanche had settled. Later he got a job teaching at a nearby normal school. At this point, all of the responsible adults in Lawrence's life seemed to arrive at a tacit agreement that the best way to raise him--certainly the easiest--was to leave him alone. On the rare occasions when Lawrence requested adult intervention in his life, he was usually asking questions that no one could answer. At the age of sixteen, having found nothing in the local school system to challenge him, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse went off to college. He matriculated at Iowa State College, which among other things was the site of a Naval ROTC installation in which he was forcibly enrolled. The Iowa State Naval ROTC had a band, and was delighted to hear that Lawrence had an interest in music. Since it was hard to drill on the deck of a dreadnought while playing a pipe organ, they issued him a glockenspiel and a couple of little dingers. When not marching back and forth on the flood plain of the Skunk River making loud dinging noises, Lawrence was majoring in mechanical engineering. He ended up doing poorly in this area because he had fallen in with a Bulgarian professor named John Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, who were building a machine that was intended to automate the solution of some especially tedious differential equations. The basic problem for Lawrence was that he was lazy. He had figured out that everything was much simpler if, like Superman with his X-ray vision, you just stared through the cosmetic distractions and saw the underlying mathematical skeleton. Once you found the math in a thing, you knew everything about it, and you could manipulate it to your heart's content with nothing more than a pencil and a napkin. He saw it in the curve of the silver bars on his glockenspiel, saw it in the catenary arch of a bridge and in the capacitor-studded drum of Atanasoff and Berry's computing machine. Actually pounding on the glockenspiel, riveting the bridge together, or trying to figure out why the computing machine wasn't working were not as interesting to him. Consequently he got poor grades. From time to time, though, he would perform some stunt on the blackboard that would leave his professor weak in the knees and the other students baffled and hostile. Word got around. At the same time, his grandmother Blanche was invoking her extensive Congregational connections, working the angles on Lawrence's behalf, totally unbeknownst to him. Her efforts culminated in triumph when Lawrence was awarded an obscure scholarship, endowed by a St. Paul oat-processing heir, whose purpose was to send Midwestern Congregationalists to the Ivy League for one year, which (evidently) was deemed a long enough period of time to raise their IQs by a few crucial points but not long enough to debauch them. So Lawrence got to be a sophomore in Princeton. Now Princeton was an august school and going there was a great honor, but no one got around to mentioning either of these facts to Lawrence, who had no way of knowing. This had bad and good consequences. He accepted the scholarship with a faintness of gratitude that infuriated the oat lord. On the other hand, he adjusted to Princeton easily because it was just another place. It reminded him of the nicer bits of Virginia, and there were some nice pipe organs in town, though he was not all that happy with his engineering homework of bridge-designing and sprocket-cutting problems. As always, these eventually came down to math, most of which he could handle easily. From time to time he would get stuck, though, which led him to the Fine Hall: the headquarters of the Math Department. There was a motley assortment of fellows wandering around in Fine Hall, many sporting British or European accents. Administratively speaking, many of these fellows were not members of the Math Department at all, but a separate thing called IAS, which stood for Institute for Advanced something-or-other. But they were all in the same building and they all knew a thing or two about math, so the distinction didn't exist for Lawrence. Quite a few of these men would pretend shyness when Lawrence sought their advice, but others were at least willing to hear him out. For example: he had come up with a way to solve a difficult sprocket tooth shape problem that, as normally solved by engineers, would require any number of perfectly reasonable but aesthetically displeasing approximations. Lawrence's solution would provide exact results. The only drawback was that it would require a quintillion slide-rule operators a quintillion years to solve. Lawrence was working on a radically different approach that, if it worked, would bring those figures down to a trillion and a trillion respectively. Unfortunately, Lawrence was unable to interest anyone at Fine Hall in anything as prosaic as gears, until all of a sudden he made friends with an energetic British fellow, whose name he promptly forgot, but who had been doing a lot of literal sprocket-making himself lately. This fellow was trying to build, of all things, a mechanical calculating machine--specifically a machine to calculate certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function. certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.  [equation cannot be rendered in text] where s is a complex number. Lawrence found this zeta function to be no more and no less interesting than any other math problem until his new friend assured him that it was frightfully important, and that some of the best mathematicians in the world had been gnawing on it for decades. The two of them ended up staying awake until three in the morning working out the solution to Lawrence's sprocket problem. Lawrence presented the results proudly to his engineering professor, who snidely rejected it, on grounds of practicality, and gave him a poor grade for his troubles. Lawrence finally remembered, after several more contacts, that the name of the friendly Brit was Al something-or-other. Because Al was a passionate cyclist, he and Al went on quite a few bicycle rides through the countryside of the Garden State. As they rode around New Jersey, they talked about math, and particularly about machines for taking the dull part of math off their hands. But Al had been thinking about this subject for longer than Lawrence, and had figured out that computing machines were much more than just labor-saving devices. He'd been working on a radically different sort of computing mechanism that would work out any arithmetic problem whatsoever, as long as you knew how to write the problem down. From a pure logic standpoint, he had already figured out everything there was to know about this (as yet hypothetical) machine, though he had yet to build one. Lawrence gathered that actually building machinery was looked on as undignified at Cambridge (England, that is, where this Al character was based) or for that matter at Fine Hall. Al was thrilled to have found, in Lawrence, someone who did not share this view. Al delicately asked him, one day, if Lawrence would terribly mind calling him by his full and proper name, which was Alan and not Al. Lawrence apologized and said he would try very hard to keep it in mind. One day a couple of weeks later, as the two of them sat by a running stream in the woods above the Delaware Water Gap, Alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to Lawrence involving penises. It required a great deal of methodical explanation, which Alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering. He was ever so polite, and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing. Lawrence decided that he was probably one of those people. Alan seemed vastly impressed that Lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologized for putting him out. They went directly back to a discussion of computing machines, and their friendship continued unchanged. But on their next bicycle ride--an overnight camping trip to the Pine Barrens--they were joined by a new fellow, a German named Rudy von something-or-other. Alan and Rudy's relationship seemed closer, or at least more multilayered, than Alan and Lawrence's. Lawrence concluded that Alan's penis scheme must have finally found a taker. It got Lawrence to thinking. From an evolution standpoint, what was the point of having people around who were not inclined to have offspring? There must be some good, and fairly subtle, reason for it. The only thing he could work out was that it was groups of people--societies--rather than individual creatures, who were now trying to out-reproduce and/or kill each other, and that, in a society, there was plenty of room for someone who didn't have kids as long as he was up to something useful. Alan and Rudy and Lawrence rode south, anyway, looking for the Pine Barrens. After a while the towns became very far apart, and the horse farms gave way to a low stubble of feeble, spiny trees that appeared to extend all the way to Florida--blocking their view, but not the headwind. ``Where are the Pine Barrens I wonder?'' Lawrence asked a couple of times. He even stopped at a gas station to ask someone that question. His companions began to make fun of him. ``Vere are ze Pine Barrens?'' Rudy inquired, looking about quizzically. ``I should look for something rather barren-looking, with numerous pine trees,'' Alan mused. There was no other traffic and so they had spread out across the road to pedal three abreast, with Alan in the middle. ``A forest, as Kafka would imagine it,'' Rudy muttered. By this point Lawrence had figured out that they were, in fact, in the Pine Barrens. But he didn't know who Kafka was. ``A mathematician?'' he guessed. ``Zat is a scary sing to sink of,'' Rudy said. ``He is a writer,'' Alan said. ``Lawrence, please don't be offended that I ask you this, but: do you recognize any other people's names at all? Other than family and close friends, I mean.'' Lawrence must have looked baffled. ``I'm trying to figure out whether it all comes from in here,'' Alan said, reaching out to rap his knuckles on the side of Lawrence's head, ``or do you sometimes take in new ideas from other human beings?'' ``When I was a little boy, I saw angels in a church in Virginia,'' Lawrence said, ``but I think that they came from inside my head.'' ``Very well,'' Alan said. But later Alan had another go at it. They had reached the fire lookout tower and it had been a thunderous disappointment: just an alienated staircase leading nowhere, and a small cleared area below that was glittery with shards of liquor bottles. They pitched their tent by the side of a pond that turned out to be full of rust-colored algae that stuck to the hairs on their bodies. Then there was nothing left to do but drink schnapps and talk about math. Alan said, ``Look, it's like this: Bertrand Russell and another chap named Whitehead wrote Principia Mathematica...'' ``Now I know you're pulling my leg,'' Waterhouse said. ``Even I know that Sir Isaac Newton wrote that.'' ``Newton wrote a different book, also called Principia Mathematica, which isn't really about mathematics at all; it's about what we would today call physics.'' ``Then why did he call it Principia Mathematica?'' ``Because the distinction between mathematics and physics wasn't especially clear in Newton's day--'' ``Or maybe even in zis day,'' Rudy said. ``--which is directly relevant to what I'm talking about,'' Alan continued. ``I am talking about Russell's P.M., in which he and Whitehead started absolutely from scratch, I mean from nothing, and built it all up--all mathematics--from a small number of first principles. And why I am telling you this, Lawrence, is that--Lawrence! Pay attention!'' ``Hmmm?'' ``Rudy--take this stick, here--that's right--and keep a close eye on Lawrence, and when he gets that foggy look on his face, poke him with it!'' ``Zis is not an English school, you can't do zese kind of sing.'' ``I'm listening,'' Lawrence said. ``What came out of P.M., which was terrifically radical, was the ability to say that all of math, really, can be expressed as a certain ordering of symbols.'' ``Leibniz said it a long time before zen!'' protested Rudy. ``Er, Leibniz invented the notation we use for calculus, but--'' ``I'm not talking about zat!'' ``And he invented matrices, but--'' ``I'm not talking about zat eezer!'' ``And he did some work with binary arithmetic, but--'' ``Zat is completely different!'' ``Well, what the hell are you talking about, then, Rudy?'' ``Leibniz invented ze basic alphabet--wrote down a set of symbols, for expressing statements about logic.'' ``Well, I wasn't aware that Herr Leibniz counted formal logic among his interests, but--'' ``Of course! He wanted to do what Russell and Whitehead did, except not just with mathematics, but with everything in ze whole world!'' ``Well from the fact that you are the only man on the planet, Rudy, who seems to know about this undertaking of Leibniz's, can we assume that he failed?'' ``You can assume anything that pleases your fancy, Alan,'' Rudy responded, ``but I am a mathematician and I do not assume anything.'' Alan sighed woundedly, and gave Rudy a Significant Look which Waterhouse assumed meant that there would be trouble later. ``If I may just make some headway, here,'' he said, ``all I'm really trying to get you to agree on, is that mathematics can be expressed as a series of symbols,'' (he snatched the Lawrence-poking stick and began drawing things like  the dirt) ``and frankly I could not care less whether they happen to be Leibniz's symbols, or Russell's, or the hexagrams of the I Ching....'' ``Leibniz was fascinated by the I Ching!'' Rudy began. ``Shut up about Leibniz for a moment, Rudy, because look here: You--Rudy--and I are on a train, as it were, sitting in the dining car, having a nice conversation, and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named The Bertrand Russell and Riemann and Euler and others. And our friend Lawrence is running alongside the train, trying to keep up with us--it's not that we're smarter than he is, necessarily, but that he's a farmer who didn't get a ticket. And I, Rudy, am simply reaching out through the open window here, trying to pull him onto the fucking train with us so that the three of us can have a nice little chat about mathematics without having to listen to him panting and gasping for breath the whole way.'' ``All right, Alan.'' ``Won't take a minute if you will just stop interrupting.'' ``But there is a locomotive too named Leibniz.'' ``Is it that you don't think I give enough credit to Germans? Because I am about to mention a fellow with an umlaut.'' ``Oh, would it be Herr Turing?'' Rudy said slyly. ``Herr Turing comes later. I was actually thinking of Godel.'' ``But he's not German! He's Austrian!'' ``I'm afraid that it's all the same now, isn't it?'' ``Ze Anschluss wasn't my idea, you don't have to look at me that way, I think Hitler is appalling.'' ``I've heard of Godel,'' Waterhouse put in helpfully. ``But could we back up just a sec?'' ``Of course Lawrence.'' ``Why bother? Why did Russell do it? Was there something wrong with math? I mean, two plus two equals four, right?'' Alan picked up two bottlecaps and set them down on the ground. ``Two. One-two. Plus--'' He set down two more. ``Another two. One-two. Equals four. One-two-three-four.'' ``What's so bad about that?'' Lawrence said. ``But Lawrence--when you really do math, in an abstract way, you're not counting bottlecaps, are you?'' ``I'm not counting anything.'' Rudy broke the following news: ``Zat is a very modern position for you to take.'' ``It is?'' Alan said, ``There was this implicit belief, for a long time, that math was a sort of physics of bottlecaps. That any mathematical operation you could do on paper, no matter how complicated, could be reduced--in theory, anyway--to messing about with actual physical counters, such as bottlecaps, in the real world.'' ``But you can't have two point one bottlecaps.'' ``All right, all right, say we use bottlecaps for integers, and for real numbers like two point one, we use physical measurements, like the length of this stick.'' Alan tossed the stick down next to the bottlecaps. ``Well what about pi, then? You can't have a stick that's exactly pi inches long.'' ``Pi is from geometry--ze same story,'' Rudy put in. ``Yes, it was believed that Euclid's geometry was really a kind of physics, that his lines and so on represented properties of the physical world. But--you know Einstein?'' ``I'm not very good with names.'' ``That white-haired chap with the big mustache?'' ``Oh, yeah,'' Lawrence said dimly, ``I tried to ask him my sprocket question. He claimed he was late for an appointment or something.'' ``That fellow has come up with a general relativity theory, which is sort of a practical application, not of Euclid's, but of Riemann's geometry--'' ``The same Riemann of your zeta function?'' ``Same Riemann, different subject. Now let's not get sidetracked here Lawrence--'' ``Riemann showed you could have many many different geometries that were not the geometry of Euclid but that still made sense internally,'' Rudy explained. ``All right, so back to P.M. then,'' Lawrence said. ``Yes! Russell and Whitehead. It's like this: when mathematicians began fooling around with things like the square root of negative one, and quaternions, then they were no longer dealing with things that you could translate into sticks and bottlecaps. And yet they were still getting sound results.'' ``Or at least internally consistent results,'' Rudy said. ``Okay. Meaning that math was more than a physics of bottlecaps.'' ``It appeared that way, Lawrence, but this raised the question of was mathematics really true or was it just a game played with symbols? In other words--are we discovering Truth, or just wanking?'' ``It has to be true because if you do physics with it, it all works out! I've heard of that general relativity thing, and I know they did experiments and figured out it was true.'' ``Ze great majority of mathematics does not lend itself to experimental testing,'' Rudy said. ``The whole idea of this project is to sever the ties to physics,'' Alan said. ``And yet not to be vanking ourselves.'' ``That's what P.M. was trying to do?'' ``Russell and Whitehead broke all mathematical concepts down into brutally simple things like sets. From there they got to integers, and so on.'' ``But how can you break something like pi down into a set?'' ``You can't,'' Alan said, ``but you can express it as a long string of digits. Three point one four one five nine, and so on.'' ``And digits are integers,'' Rudy said. ``But no fair! Pi itself is not an integer!'' ``But you can calculate the digits of pi, one at a time, by using certain formulas. And you can write down the formulas like so!'' Alan scratches this in the dirt: ``I have used the Leibniz series in order to placate our friend. See, Lawrence? It is a string of symbols.'' ``Okay. I see the string of symbols,'' Lawrence said reluctantly. ``Can we move on? Godel said, just a few years ago, `Say! If you buy into this business about mathematics being just strings of symbols, guess what?' And he pointed out that any string of symbols--such as this very formula, here--can be translated into integers.'' ``How?'' ``Nothing fancy, Lawrence--it's just simple encryption. Arbitrary. The number `538' might be written down instead of this great ugly £, and so on.'' ``Seems pretty close to wanking, now.'' ``No, no. Because then Godel sprang the trap! Formulas can act on numbers, right?'' ``Sure. Like 2x.'' ``Yes. You can substitute any number for x and the formula 2x will double it. But if another mathematical formula, such as this one right here, for calculating pi, can be encoded as a number, then you can have another formula act on it. Formulas acting on formulas!'' ``Is that all?'' ``No. Then he showed, really through a very simple argument, that if formulas really can refer to themselves, it's possible to write one down saying `this statement cannot be proved.' Which was tremendously startling to Hilbert and everyone else, who expected the opposite result.'' ``Have you mentioned this Hilbert guy before?'' ``No, he is new to this discussion, Lawrence.'' ``Who is he?'' ``A man who asks difficult questions. He asked a whole list of them once. Go[audel answered one of them.'' ``And Turing answered another,'' Rudy said. ``Who's that?'' ``It's me,'' Alan said. ``But Rudy's joking. `Turing' doesn't really have an umlaut in it.'' ``He's going to have an umlaut in him later tonight,'' Rudy said, looking at Alan in a way that, in retrospect, years later, Lawrence would understand to have been smoldering. ``Well, don't keep me in suspense. Which one of his questions did you answer?'' ``The Entscheidungsproblem,'' Rudy said. ``Meaning?'' Alan explained, ``Hilbert wanted to know whether any given statement could, in principle, be found true or false.'' ``But after Godel got finished, it changed,'' Rudy pointed out. ``That's true--after Godel it became `Can we determine whether any given statement is provable or non-provable?' In other words, is there some sort of mechanical process we could use to separate the provable statements from the nonprovable ones?'' `` `Mechanical process' is supposed to be a metaphor, Alan....'' ``Oh, stop it, Rudy! Lawrence and I are quite comfortable with machinery.'' ``I get it,'' Lawrence said. ``What do you mean, you get it?'' Alan said. ``Your machine--not the zeta-function calculator, but the other one. The one we've been talking about building--'' ``It is called Universal Turing Machine,'' Rudy said. ``The whole point of that gizmo is to separate provable from nonprovable statements, isn't it?'' ``That's why I came up with the basic idea for it,'' Alan said. ``So Hilbert's question has been answered. Now I just want to actually build one so that I can beat Rudy at chess.'' ``You haven't told poor Lawrence the answer yet!'' Rudy protested. ``Lawrence can figure it out,'' Alan said. ``It'll give him something to do.'' Soon it became clear that Alan really meant: It'll give him something to do while we're fucking. Lawrence shoved a notebook into the waistband of his trousers and rode his bicycle a few hundred yards to the fire tower, then climbed up the stairs to the platform at the top and sat down, back to the setting sun, notebook propped up on his knees to catch the light. He could not collect his thoughts, and then he was distracted by a false sunrise that lit up the clouds off to the northeast. He thought at first that some low clouds were bouncing fragments of the sunset back to him, but it was too concentrated and flickering for that. Then he thought it was lightning. But the color of the light was not blue enough. It fluctuated sharply, modulated by (one had to assume) great, startling events that were occulted by the horizon. As the sun went down on the opposite side of the world, the light on the New Jersey horizon focused to a steady, lambent core the color of a flashlight when you shine it through the palm of your hand under the bedsheets. Lawrence climbed down the stairs and got on his bicycle and rode through the Pine Barrens. Before long he came to a road that led in the general direction of the light. Most of the time he could not see anything, not even the road, but after a couple of hours the glow bouncing off the low cloud layer lit up flat stones in the road, and turned the barrens' wandering rivulets into glowing crevices. The road began to tend in the wrong direction and so Lawrence cut directly into the woods, because he was very close now, and the light in the sky was strong enough that he could see it through the sparse carpet of scrubby pines--black sticks that appeared to have been burned, though they hadn't. The ground had turned into sand, but it was damp and compacted, and his bicycle had fat tires that rode over it well. At one point he had to stop and throw the bike over a barbed-wire fence. Then he broke out of the sticks and onto a perfectly flat expanse of white sand, stitched down with tufts of beach grass, and just then he was dazzled by a low fence of quiet steady flames that ran across a part of the horizon about as wide as the harvest moon when it sinks into the sea. Its brightness made it difficult to see anything else--Lawrence kept riding into little ditches and creeks that meandered across the flats. He learned not to stare directly at the flames. Looking off to the sides was more interesting anyway: the table-land was marked at wide intervals by the largest buildings he had ever seen, cracker-box structures built by Pharaohs, and in the mile-wide plazas between them, gnomons of triangulated steel were planted in wide stances: the internal skeletons of pyramids. The largest of these pierced the center of a perfectly circular railway line a few hundred feet in diameter: two argent curves scored on the dull ground, interrupted in one place where the tower's shadow, a stopped sundial, told the time. He rode by a building smaller than the others, with oval tanks standing next to it. Steam murmured from valves on the tops of the tanks, but instead of rising into the air it dribbled down the sides and struck the ground and spread out, coating the sea-grass with jackets of silver. A thousand sailors in white were standing in a ring around the long flame. One of them held up his hand and waved Lawrence down. Lawrence came to a stop next to the sailor and planted one foot on the sand to steady himself. He and the sailor stared at each other for a moment and then Lawrence, who could not think of anything else, said, ``I am in the Navy also.'' Then the sailor seemed to make up his mind about something. He saluted Lawrence through, and pointed him towards a small building off to the side of the fire. The building looked only like a wall glowing in the firelight, but sometimes a barrage of magnesium blue light made its windowframes jump out of the darkness, a rectangular lightning-bolt that echoed many times across the night. Lawrence started pedaling again and rode past that building: a spiraling flock of alert fedoras, prodding at slim terse notebooks with stately Ticonderogas, crab-walking photogs turning their huge chrome daisies, crisp rows of people sleeping with blankets over their faces, a sweating man with Brilliantined hair chalking umlauted names on a blackboard. Finally coming around this building he smelled hot fuel oil, felt the heat of the flames on his face and saw beach-glass curled toward it and desiccated. He stared down upon the world's globe, not the globe fleshed with continents and oceans but only its skeleton: a burst of meridians, curving backwards to cage an inner dome of orange flame. Against the light of the burning oil those longitudes were thin and crisp as a draftsman's ink-strokes. But coming closer he saw them resolve into clever works of rings and struts, hollow as a bird's bones. As they spread away from the pole they sooner or later began to wander, or split into bent parts, or just broke off and hung in the fire oscillating like dry stalks. The perfect geometry was also mottled, here and there, by webs of cable and harnesses of electrical wiring. Lawrence almost rode over a broken wine bottle and decided he should now walk, to spare his bicycle's tires, so he laid the bike down, the front wheel covering an aluminum vase that appeared to have been spun on a lathe, with a few charred roses hanging out of it. Some sailors had joined their hands to form a sort of throne, and were bearing along a human-shaped piece of charcoal dressed in a coverall of immaculate asbestos. As they walked the toes of their shoes caught in vast, ramified snarls of ropes and piano-wires, cables and wires, creative furtive movements in the grass and the sand dozens of yards every direction. Lawrence began planting his feet very thoughtfully one in front of the other, trying to measure the greatness of what he had come and seen. A rocket-shaped pod stuck askew from the sand, supporting an umbrella of bent-back propellers. The duralumin struts and catwalks rambled on above him for miles. There was a suitcase spilled open, with a pair of women's shoes displayed as if in the window of a downtown store, and a menu that had been charred to an oval glow, and then some tousled wall-slabs, like a whole room that had dropped out of the sky--these were decorated, one with a giant map of the world, great circles arcing away from Berlin to pounce on cities near and far, and another with a photograph of a famous, fat German in a uniform, grinning on a flowered platform, the giant horizon of a new Zeppelin behind him. After a while he stopped seeing new things. Then he got on his bicycle and rode back through the Pine Barrens. He got lost in the dark and so didn't find his way back to the fire tower until dawn. But he didn't mind being lost because while he rode around in the dark he thought about the Turing machine. Finally he came back to the shore of the pond where they had camped. The dawn-light shining on the saucer of calm reddish water made it look like a pool of blood. Alan Mathison Turing and Rudolf von Hacklheber were lying together like spoons on the shore, still smudged a little bit from their swim yesterday. Lawrence started a little fire and made some tea and they woke up eventually. ``Did you solve the problem?'' Alan asked him. ``Well you can turn that Universal Turing Machine of yours into any machine by changing the presets--'' ``Presets?'' ``Sorry, Alan, I think of your U.T.M. as being kind of like a pipe organ.'' ``Oh.'' ``Once you've done that, anyway, you can do any calculation you please, if the tape is long enough. But gosh, Alan, making a tape that's long enough, and that you can write symbols on, and erase them, is going to be sort of tricky--Atanasoff's capacitor drum would only work up to a certain size--you'd have to--'' ``This is a digression,'' Alan said gently. ``Yeah, okay, well--if you had a machine like that, then any given preset could be represented by a number--a string of symbols. And the tape that you would feed into it to start the calculation would contain another string of symbols. So it's Go[audel's proof all over again--if any possible combination of machine and data can be represented by a string of numbers, then you can just arrange all of the possible strings of numbers into a big table, and then it turns into a Cantor diagonal type of argument, and the answer is that there must be some numbers that cannot be computed.'' ``And ze Entscheidungsproblem?'' Rudy reminded him. ``Proving or disproving a formula--once you've encrypted the formula into numbers, that is--is just a calculation on that number. So it means that the answer to the question is, no! Some formulas cannot be proved or disproved by any mechanical process! So I guess there's some point in being human after all!'' Alan looked pleased until Lawrence said this last thing, and then his face collapsed. ``Now there you go making unwarranted assumptions.'' ``Don't listen to him, Lawrence!'' Rudy said. ``He's going to tell you that our brains are Turing machines.'' ``Thank you, Rudy,'' Alan said patiently. ``Lawrence, I submit that our brains are Turing machines.'' ``But you proved that there's a whole lot of formulas that a Turing machine can't process!'' ``And you have proved it too, Lawrence.'' ``But don't you think that we can do some things that a Turing machine couldn't?'' ``Godel agrees with you, Lawrence,'' Rudy put in, ``and so does Hardy.'' ``Give me one example,'' Alan said. ``Of a noncomputable function that a human can do, and a Turing machine can't?'' ``Yes. And don't give me any sentimental nonsense about creativity. I believe that a Universal Turing Machine could show behaviors that we would construe as creative.'' ``Well, I don't know then... I'll try to keep my eye out for that kind of thing in the future.'' But later, as they were riding back towards Princeton, he said, ``What about dreams?'' ``Like those angels in Virginia?'' ``I guess so.'' ``Just noise in the neurons, Lawrence.'' ``Also I dreamed last night that a zeppelin was burning.'' Soon, Alan got his Ph.D. and went back to England. He wrote Lawrence a couple of letters. The last of these stated, simply, that he would not be able to write Lawrence any more letters ``of substance'' and that Lawrence should not take it personally. Lawrence perceived right away that Alan's society had put him to work doing something useful--probably figuring out how to keep it from being eaten alive by certain of its neighbors. Lawrence wondered what use America would find for him. He went back to Iowa State, considered changing his major to mathematics, but didn't. It was the consensus of all whom he consulted that mathematics, like pipe-organ restoration, was a fine thing, but that one needed some way to put bread on the table. He remained in engineering and did more and more poorly at it until the middle of his senior year, when the university suggested that he enter a useful line of work, such as roofing. He walked straight out of college into the waiting arms of the Navy. They gave him an intelligence test. The first question on the math part had to do with boats on a river: Port Smith is 100 miles upstream of Port Jones. The river flows at 5 miles per hour. The boat goes through water at 10 miles per hour. How long does it take to go from Port Smith to Port Jones? How long to come back? Lawrence immediately saw that it was a trick question. You would have to be some kind of idiot to make the facile assumption that the current would add or subtract 5 miles per hour to or from the speed of the boat. Clearly, 5 miles per hour was nothing more than the average speed. The current would be faster in the middle of the river and slower at the banks. More complicated variations could be expected at bends in the river. Basically it was a question of hydrodynamics, which could be tackled using certain well-known systems of differential equations. Lawrence dove into the problem, rapidly (or so he thought) covering both sides of ten sheets of paper with calculations. Along the way, he realized that one of his assumptions, in combination with the simplified Navier-Stokes equations, had led him into an exploration of a particularly interesting family of partial differential equations. Before he knew it, he had proved a new theorem. If that didn't prove his intelligence, what would? Then the time bell rang and the papers were collected. Lawrence managed to hang onto his scratch paper. He took it back to his dorm, typed it up, and mailed it to one of the more approachable math professors at Princeton, who promptly arranged for it to be published in a Parisian mathematics journal. Lawrence received two free, freshly printed copies of the journal a few months later, in San Diego, California, during mail call on board a large ship called the U.S.S. Nevada. The ship had a band, and the Navy had given Lawrence the job of playing the glockenspiel in it, because their testing procedures had proven that he was not intelligent enough to do anything else. The sack of mail carrying Lawrence's contribution to the mathematical literature arrived just in the nick of time. Lawrence's ship, and quite a few of her sisters, had until then been based in California. But at just this moment, all of them were transferred to some place called Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in order to show the Nips who was boss. Lawrence had never really known what he wanted to do with his life, but he quickly decided that being glockenspiel player on a battleship in Hawaii during peacetime was a long way from the worst life you could possibly have. The harshest part of the job was sometimes having to sit or march in very warm conditions, and enduring occasional fluffed notes by other band members. He had abundant free time, which he spent working on a series of new theorems in the field of information theory. The field had been invented and pretty much encompassed by his friend Alan, but there was much detail work to be done. He and Alan and Rudy had sketched out a general plan of what needed to be proved or disproved. Lawrence tore through the list. He wondered what Alan and Rudy were up to in Britain and Germany, but he couldn't write to them and find out, so he kept his work to himself. When he wasn't playing the glockenspiel or working out theorems, there were bars and dances to go to. Waterhouse did some penis work of his own, got the clap, had it cured,* bought condoms. All of the sailors did this. They were like three-year olds who shove pencils in their ears, discover that it hurts, and stop doing it. Lawrence's first year went by almost instantly. Time just blazed by. Nowhere could be sunnier, more relaxing, than Hawaii. *1940 being a good year to begin experimenting with venereal diseases in that the new injectable penicillin was just becoming available NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM ``Filipinos are a warm, gentle, caring, giving people,'' avi says, ``which is a good thing since so many of them carry concealed weapons.'' Randy is in Tokyo's airport, ambling down a concourse with a slowness that is infuriating to his fellow travelers. They have all spent the last half-day strapped into bad chairs, stuffed into an aluminum tube aslosh with jet fuel. Over the safety-engineered nubs molded into the jetway floor, their rolling suitcases drone like fighter planes. They graze the backs of his knees as they bank around his husky columnar body. Randy is holding his new GSM phone to the side of his head. Supposedly it works anywhere in the world, except for the United States. This is his first chance to try it out. ``You sound clear as a bell,'' Avi says. ``How was the flight over?'' ``All right,'' Randy says. ``They had one of those animated maps up on the video screen.'' Avi sighs. ``All the airlines have those now,'' he announces monotonically. ``The only feature between San Francisco and Tokyo was Midway Island.'' ``So?'' ``It kind of hung there for hours. MIDWAY. Mute embarrassment all around.'' Randy reaches the departure gate for Manila, and pauses to admire a five-foot-wide high-definition TV set bearing the logo of a major Nipponese consumer-electronics company. It is running a video in which a wacky cartoon professor and his adorable canine sidekick cheerfully tick off the three transmission routes of the AIDS virus. ``I have a fingerprint for you,'' Randy says. ``Shoot.'' Randy stares at the palm of his hand, on which he has written a string of numbers and letters in ballpoint pen. ``AF 10 06 E9 99 BA 11 07 64 C1 89 E3 40 8C 72 55.'' ``Got it,'' Avi says. ``That's from Ordo, right?'' ``Right. I e-mailed you the key from SFO.'' ``The apartment situation is still resolving,'' Avi says. ``So I just reserved you a suite at the Manila Hotel.'' ``What do you mean, it's still resolving?'' ``The Philippines is one of those post-Spanish countries with no clear boundaries between business and personal relationships,'' Avi says. ``I don't think you can secure lodgings there without marrying into a family with a major street named after it.'' Randy takes a seat in the departure area. Perky gate attendants in jaunty, improbable hats zero in on Filipinos with too many carry-ons, and subject them to a public ritual of filling out little tags and surrendering their possessions. The Filipinos roll their eyes and stare longingly out the windows. But most of the waiting passengers are Nipponese--some businessmen, mostly vacationers. They are watching an educational video about how to get mugged in foreign countries. ``Huh,'' Randy says, looking out the window, ``got another 747 down to Manila.'' ``In Asia, no decent airline bothers to dick around anything smaller than a 747,'' Avi snaps. ``If someone tries to pack you on board a 737 or god forbid an Airbus, run, don't walk, away from the boarding lounge, and call me on my Sky Pager and I'll send in a chopper to evacuate you.'' Randy laughs. Avi continues. ``Now, listen. This hotel you're going to is very old, very grand, but it's in the middle of nowhere.'' ``Why would they build a grand hotel in the middle of nowhere?'' ``It used to be a happening place--it's on the waterfront, right on the edge of Intramuros.'' Randy's high-school Spanish is enough to translate that: Inside the Walls. ``But Intramuros was annihilated by the Nipponese in 1945,'' Avi continues. ``Systematically. All of the business hotels and office buildings are in a new neighborhood called Makati, much closer to the airport.'' ``So you want to put our office in Intramuros.'' ``How'd you guess?'' Avi says, sounding a little spooked. He prides himself on unpredictability. ``I'm not an intuitive guy generally,'' Randy says, ``but I've been on a plane for thirteen hours and my brain has been turned inside out and hung up to dry.'' Avi rattles off canned justifications: office space is much cheaper in Intramuros. Government ministries are closer. Makati, the gleaming new business district, is too isolated from the real Philippines. Randy pays no attention to it. ``You want to work out of Intramuros because it was systematically annihilated, and because you're obsessed with the Holocaust,'' Randy finally says, quietly and without rancor. ``Yeah. So?'' Avi says. Randy stares out the window of the Manila-bound 747, sipping on a fluorescent green Nipponese soft drink made from bee extracts (at least, it has pictures of bees on it) and munching on something that a flight attendant handed him called Japanese Snack. Sky and ocean are the same color, a shade of blue that makes his teeth freeze. The plane is so high that, whether he looks up or down, he sees foreshortened views of boiling cumulonimbus stacks. The clouds erupt from the hot Pacific as if immense warships were exploding all over the place. The speed and power of their growth is alarming, the forms they adopt as bizarre and varied as those of deep-sea organisms, and all of them, he supposes, are as dangerous to an airplane as punji stakes to a barefoot pedestrian. The red-orange meatball painted on the wingtip startles him when he notices it. He feels like he's been thrown into an old war film. He turns on his laptop. Electronic mail from Avi, encrypted to a fare-thee-well, has been piling up in his in-box. It is a gradual accumulation of tiny files, thrown at him by Avi whenever a thought popped into his head over the last three days; it would be obvious, even if Randy didn't know it, that Avi owns a portable e-mail machine that talks to the Internet by radio. Randy fires up a piece of software that is technically called Novus Ordo Seclorum but that everyone calls Ordo for short. It is a fairly strained pun based on the fact that Ordo's job, as a piece of cryptographic software, is to put a message's bits in a New Order and that it will take Centuries for nosy governments to decrypt it. A scanned image of a Great Pyramid appears in the middle of his screen, and a single eye gradually materializes at its apex. Ordo can handle this in one of two ways. The obvious way is to decrypt all of the messages and convert them into plaintext files on his hard disk, which he can then read any time he wants. The problem with this (if you are paranoid) is that anyone who gets his hands on Randy's hard disk can then read the files. For all he knows, the customs officials in Manila will decide to ransack his computer for child pornography. Or, fogged by jet lag, he'll leave his laptop in a taxi. So instead he puts Ordo into a streaming mode where it will decrypt the files just long enough for him to read them and then, when he closes the windows, expunge the plaintext from the computer's memory and from its hard drive. The subject heading of Avi's first message is: ``Guideline 1.'' We look for places where the math is right. Meaning what? Meaning that pop. is about to explode---we can predict that just by looking at age histogram---and per capita income is about to take off the way it did in Nippon, Taiwan, Singapore. Multiply those two things together and you get the kind of exponential growth that should get us all into fuck-you money before we turn forty. This is an allusion to a Randy/Avi conversation of two years ago wherein Avi actually calculated a specific numerical value for ``fuck-you money.'' It was not a fixed constant, however, but rather a cell in a spreadsheet linked to any number of continually fluctuating economic indicators. Sometimes when Avi is working at his computer he will leave the spreadsheet running in a tiny window in the corner so that he can see the current value of ``fuck-you money'' at a glance. The second message, sent a couple of hours later, is called ``Guideline 2.'' Two: pick a tech where no one can compete with us. Right now, that=networking. We're kicking the crap out of everyone else in the world when it comes to networking. It's not even funny. The next day, Avi sent a message called, simply, ``More.'' Perhaps he had lost track of the number of guidelines he'd issued so far. Another principle: this time we retain control of the corporation. That means that we keep at least fifty percent of the shares---which means little to no outside investment until we've built up some value. ``You don't have to convince me,'' Randy mumbles to himself, as he reads this. This shapes the kinds of businesses we can get into. Forget anything that requires a big initial investment. Luzon is green-black jungle mountains gouged with rivers that would appear to be avalanches of silt. As the navy-blue ocean verges on its khaki beaches, the water takes on the shocking iridescent hue of a suburban swimming pool. Farther south, the mountains are swidden-scarred--the soil beneath is bright red and so these parts look like fresh lacerations. But most is covered with foliage that looks like the nubby green stuff that model railroaders put over their papier-mache hills, and in vast stretches of the mountains there are no signs whatsoever that human beings have ever existed. Closer to Manila, some of the slopes are deforested, sprinkled with structures, ribboned with power-line cuts. Rice paddies line the basins. The towns are accretions of shanties, nucleated around large cross-shaped churches with good roofs. The view gets blurry as they belly down into the pall of sweaty smog above the city. The plane begins to sweat like a giant glass of iced tea. The water streams off in sheets, collects in crevices, whips off the flaps' trailing edges. Suddenly they are banking over Manila Bay, which is marked with endless streaks of brilliant red--some kind of algal bloom. Oil tankers trail long time-delayed rainbows that flourish in their wakes. Every cove is jammed with long skinny boats with dual outriggers, looking like brightly painted water skaters. And then they are down on the runway at NAIA, Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Guards and cops of various stripes are ambling around with M-16s or pistol-handled pump shotguns, wearing burnooses fashioned from handkerchiefs clamped to the head with American baseball caps. A man dressed in a radiant white uniform stands below the ragged maw of the jetway holding his hands downwards with fluorescent orange sticks in them, like Christ dispensing mercy on a world of sinners. Sulfurous, fulminating tropical air begins to leak in through the jumbo's air vents. Everything moistens and wilts. He is in Manila. He takes his passport out of his shirt pocket. It says, RANDALL LAWRENCE WATERHOUSE. This is how Epiphyte Corporation came into existence: ``I am channeling the bad shit!'' Avi said. The number came through on Randy's pager while he was sitting around a table in a grubhouse along the coast with his girlfriend's crowd. A place where, every day, they laser-printed fresh menus on 100% recycled imitation parchment, where oscilloscope tracings of neon-colored sauces scribbled across the plates, and the entrees were towering, architectonic stacks of rare ingredients carved into gemlike prisms. Randy had spent the entire meal trying to resist the temptation to invite one of Charlene's friends (any one of them, it didn't matter) out on the sidewalk for a fistfight. He glanced at his pager expecting to see the number of the Three Siblings Computer Center, which was where he worked (technically, still does). The fell digits of Avi's phone number penetrated the core of his being in the same way that 666 would a fundamentalist's. Fifteen seconds later, Randy was out on the sidewalk, swiping his card through a pay phone like an assassin drawing a single-edged razor blade across the throat of a tubby politician. ``The power is coming down from On High,'' Avi continued. ``Tonight, it happens to be coming through me--you poor bastard.'' ``What do you want me to do?'' Randy asked, adopting a cold, almost hostile tone to mask sick excitement. ``Buy a ticket to Manila,'' Avi said. ``I have to talk it over with Charlene first,'' Randy said. ``You don't even believe that yourself,'' Avi said. ``Charlene and I have a long-standing relationsh--'' ``It's been ten years. You haven't married her. Fill in the fucking blanks.'' (Seventy-two hours later, he would be in Manila, looking at the One-Note Flute.) ``Everyone in Asia is wondering when the Philippines is finally going to get its shit together,'' Avi said, ``it's the question of the nineties.'' (The One-Note Flute is the first thing you see when you make it through passport control.) ``I flashed on this when I was standing in line at Passport Control at Ninoy Aquino International Airport,'' Avi said, compressing that entire name into a single, sharply articulated burst. ``You know how they have different lanes?'' ``I guess so,'' Randy said. A parallelpiped of seared tuna did a barrel roll in his gullet. He felt a perverse craving for a double ice-cream cone. He did not travel as much as Avi, and had only a vague idea of what he meant by lanes. ``You know. One lane for citizens. One for foreigners. Maybe one for diplomats.'' (Now, standing there waiting to have his passport stamped, Randy can see it clearly. For once he doesn't mind the wait. He gets in a lane next to the OCW lane and studies them. They are Epiphyte Corp.'s market. Mostly young women, many of them fashionably dressed, but still with a kind of Catholic boarding-school demureness. Exhausted from long flights, tired of the wait, they slump, then suddenly straighten up and elevate their fine chins, as if an invisible nun were making her way up the line whacking their manicured knuckles with a ruler.) But seventy-two hours ago he hadn't really understood what Avi meant by lanes, so he just said, ``Yeah, I've seen the lane thing.'' ``At Manila, they have a whole lane just for returning OCWs!'' ``OCWs?'' ``Overseas Contract Workers. Filipinos working abroad--because the economy of the Philippines is so lame. As maids and nannies in Saudi. Nurses and anesthesiologists in the States. Singers in Hong Kong, whores in Bangkok.'' ``Whores in Bangkok?'' Randy had been there, at least, and his mind reeled at the concept of importing prostitutes to Thailand. ``The Filipino women are more beautiful,'' Avi said quietly, ``and have a ferocity that makes them more interesting, to the innately masochistic business traveler, than all those grinning Thai bimbos.'' Both of them knew that this was complete bullshit; Avi was a family man and had no firsthand experience whereof he spoke. Randy didn't call him on it, though. As long as Avi retained this extemporaneous bullshitting ability there was a better than even chance of all of them making fuck-you money. (Now that he's here, it is tempting to speculate as to which of the girls in the OCW lane are hustlers. But he can't see that going anywhere but wrong, so he squares his shoulders and marches toward the yellow line. The government has set up glass display cases in the concourse leading from passport control to the security barrier. The cases contain artifacts demonstrating the glories of pre-Magellan Filipino culture. The first one of these contains the piece de resistance: a rustic hand-carved musical instrument labeled with a long and unreadable name in Tagalog. Underneath that, in smaller letters, is the English translation: ONE-NOTE FLUTE.) ``See? The Philippines is innately hedged,'' Avi said. ``You know how rare that is? When you find an innately hedged environment, Randy, you lunge into it like a rabid ferret going into a pipe full of raw meat.'' A word about Avi: his father's people had just barely gotten out of Prague. As Central European Jews went, they were fairly typical. The only thing about them that was really anomalous was that they were still alive. But his mother's people were unbelievably peculiar New Mexican crypto-Jews who had been living on mesas, dodging Jesuits, shooting rattlesnakes and eating jimson weed for three hundred years; they looked like Indians and talked like cowboys. In his relations with other people, therefore, Avi dithered. Most of the time he was courtly and correct in a way that was deeply impressive to businesspeople--Nipponese ones expecially--but there were these eruptions, from time to time, as if he'd been dipping into the loco weed. Randy had learned to deal with it, which is why Avi called him at times like this. ``Oh, calm down!'' Randy said. He watched a tanned girl rollerblade past him, on her way up from the beach. ``Innately hedged?'' ``As long as the Philippines don't have their shit together, there'll be plenty of OCWs. They will want to communicate with their families--the Filipinos are incredibly family-oriented. They make Jews look like a bunch of alienated loners.'' ``Okay. You know more about both groups than I do.'' ``They are sentimental and affectionate in a way that's very easy for us to sneer at.'' ``You don't have to be defensive,'' Randy said, ``I'm not sneering at them.'' ``When you hear their song dedications on the radio, you'll sneer,'' Avi said. ``But frankly, we could take some pointers from the Pinoys on this front.'' ``You are so close to being sanctimonious right now--'' ``I apologize,'' Avi said, with absolute sincerity. Avi's wife had been pregnant almost continuously for the four years they'd been married. He was getting more religiously observant daily and couldn't make it through a conversation without mentioning the Holocaust. Randy was a bachelor who was just about to break up with the chick he'd been living with. ``I believe you, Avi,'' Randy said. ``Is it a problem with you if I buy a business-class ticket?'' Avi didn't hear him, so Randy assumed that meant yes. ``As long as that's the case, there will be a big market for Pinoy-grams.'' ``Pinoy-grams?'' ``For god's sake, don't say it out loud! I'm filling out the trademark application as we speak,'' Avi said. Randy could hear a rattling sound in the background, computer keys impacting so rapidly it sounded like Avi was simply holding the keyboard between his pale, spindly hands and shaking it violently up and down. ``But if the Filipinos do get their shit together, then we see explosive growth in telecoms, as in any other Arday.'' ``Arday?'' ``R-D-A-E. Rapidly Developing Asian Economy. Either way, we win.'' ``I gather you want to do something with telecoms?'' ``Bingo.'' In the background, a baby began to cough and cry. ``Gotta go,'' Avi said, ``Shlomo's asthma is spiking again. Take down this fingerprint.'' ``Fingerprint?'' ``For my encryption key. For e-mail.'' ``Ordo?'' ``Yeah.'' Randy took out a ballpoint pen and, finding no paper in his pocket, poised it over the palm of his hand. ``Shoot.'' ``67 81 A4 AE FF 40 25 9B 43 0E 29 8D 56 60 E3 2F.'' Then Avi hung up the phone. Randy went back into the restaurant. On his way back, he asked the waiter to bring him a half-bottle of good red wine. Charlene heard him, and glowered. Randy was still thinking about innate ferocity, and did not see it in her face; only a schoolmarmishness common among all of her friends. My god! I have to get out of California, he realized. SEAWEED Woman holds baby Eyes pale as a muzzle flash Band chimes frozen tears The fourth marines is marching downhill to the strains of John Philip Sousa, which ought to be second nature to a Marine. But the Fourth Marines have been in Shanghai (which ain't no halls of Montezuma nor shores of Tripoli) for too long, longer than Marines should ever stay in one place, and Bobby's already seen his sergeant, one Frick, throw up from opium withdrawal. A Marine band is several Shanghai blocks ahead. Bobby's platoon can hear the thumpity-thump of the big drums and the piercing noises from piccolos and glockenspiels but he can't follow the tune. Corporal Shaftoe is effectively their leader, because Sergeant Frick is useless. Shaftoe marches alongside the formation, supposedly to keep an eye on his men, but mostly he's just staring at Shanghai. Shanghai stares back, and mostly gives them a standing ovation. Of course there is a type of young street rowdy who makes it a point of honor to let the Marines know he isn't scared of them, and they are jeering the Marines from a safe distance, and setting off strings of firecrackers, which does nothing to steady anyone's nerves. The Europeans are applauding--a whole chorus line of Russian dancing girls from Delmonte's is showing thigh and blowing kisses. But most of the Chinese look pretty stonefaced, which--Bobby suspects--means they're scared shitless. The worst thing is the women carrying half-white babies. A few of these women are rabid, hysterical, throwing themselves into formations of massed Marines, undeterred by rifle butts. But most of them are stoic: they stand with their light-eyed babies and glare, searching the ranks and files for the guilty party. They've all heard about what happened upriver in Nanjing when the Nips came there, and they know that when it's all over, the only trace that they and their babies ever existed may be a really bad memory in the mind of some American Marine. It works for Shaftoe: he has hunted deer in Wisconsin and seen them limping across the snow, bleeding to death. He saw a man die in basic training at Parris Island. He has seen whole tangles of bodies in the Yangtze, downstream of where the Nipponese were prosecuting the China Incident, and he has seen refugees from places like Nanjing starve to death in the gutters of Shanghai. He has himself killed people who were trying to storm the riverboats it was his duty to protect. He thinks that he has never seen, and will never see, anything as terrible as those stone-faced Chinese women holding their white babies, not even blinking as the firecrackers explode all around them. Until, that is, he looks into the faces of certain Marines who stare into that crowd and see their own faces looking back at them, pudgy with baby fat and streaked with tears. Some of them seem to think it's all a joke. But many of the Marines who march out of their empty barracks that morning sane and solid men, have, by the time they reach the gunboats waiting for them at the Bund, gone mad. They don't show it. But Shaftoe can see in their eyes that something has given way inside. The very best men in the regiment are in a foul mood. The ones like Shaftoe, who didn't get involved with the Chinese women, are still leaving plenty behind: houses with maids and shoeshine boys and coolies, with women and opium for almost nothing. They don't know where they are being shipped off to, but it's safe to say that their twenty-one dollars a month won't go as far. They'll be in barracks and they'll have to learn to polish their own boots again. When the gangplanks are drawn in from the stone edge of the Bund, they are cut off from a whole world that they'll never see again, a world where they were kings. Now they are Marines again. It's okay with Shaftoe, who wants to be a Marine. But many of the men have become middle-aged here, and don't. The guilty men duck belowdecks. Shaftoe remains on the deck of the gunboat, which casts off from the Bund, headed for the cruiser Augusta, which awaits in mid-channel. The Bund is jammed with onlookers in a riot of differently colored clothing, so one patch of uniform drab catches his eye: a group of Nip soldiers who've come down to bid their Yank counterparts a sarcastic farewell. Shaftoe scans the group looking for someone tall and bulky, and picks him out easily. Goto Dengo's waving to him. Shaftoe takes his helmet off and waves back. Then, on impulse, just for the hell of it, he winds up and flings the helmet directly at Goto Dengo's head. The throw goes awry and Goto Dengo has to knock down about a dozen of his comrades in order to catch it. All of them seem to think that it is a high honor, as well as tremendously amusing, to be knocked down by Goto Dengo. Twenty seconds later, a comet sails up out of the flesh cosmos of the Bund and bounces on the wooden deck of the gunboat--a hell of a throw. Goto Dengo is showing off his follow-through. The projectile is a rock with a white streamer wrapped around it. Shaftoe runs over and snatches it. The streamer is one of those thousand-stitch headbands (supposedly; he's taken a few off of unconscious Nips, but he's never bothered to count the stitches) that they tie around their heads as a good-luck charm; it has a meatball in the center and some Nip writing to either side. He unties it from around the rock. In so doing he realizes, suddenly, that it's not a rock after all; it is a hand grenade! But good old Goto Dengo was just joking--he didn't pull the pin. A nice souvenir for Bobby Shaftoe. Shaftoe's first haiku (December 1940) was a quick and dirty adaptation of the Marine Creed: This is my rifle There are many like it but This rifle is mine. He wrote it under the following circumstances: Shaftoe and the rest of Fourth Marines were stationed in Shanghai so that they could guard the International Settlement and work as muscle on the gunboats of the Yangtze River Patrol. His platoon had just come back from the Last Patrol: a thousand-mile reconnaissance-in-force all the way up past what was left of Nanjing, to Hankow, and back. Marines had been doing this ever since the Boxer Rebellion, through civil wars and everything else. But towards the end of 1940, what with the Nips basically running all of northeast China now, the politicians back in D.C. had finally thrown in the towel and told the China Marines not to steam up the Yangtze any more. Now, the Old Breed Marines like Frick claimed they could tell the difference between organized brigands; armed mobs of starving peasants; rogue Nationalists; Communist guerrillas; and the irregular forces in the pay of warlords. But to Bobby Shaftoe they were all just crazy, armed slopes who wanted a piece of the Yangtze River Patrol. The Last Patrol had been a wild trip. But it was over and they were back in Shanghai now, the safest place you could be in China, and about a hundred times more dangerous than the most dangerous place you could be in America. They had climbed off the gunboat six hours ago, gone to a bar, and not come out until just now, when they had decided it was high time they went to a whorehouse. On their way, they happened to pass this Nip restaurant. Bobby Shaftoe had looked in the windows of the place before, and watched the man with the knife, trying to figure out what the hell he was doing. It looked a hell of a lot like he was cutting up uncooked fish and putting the raw meat on bullets of rice and handing it over to the Nips on the other side of the counter, who were wolfing it down. It had to be some kind of optical illusion. The fish must have been precooked in the back room. This had been nagging at Shaftoe for about a year. As he and the other horny drunk Marines went by the place, he slowed down to peer through the window, trying to gather more evidence. He could swear that some of that fish looked ruby red, which it wouldn't have been if it were cooked. One of his buddies, Rhodes from Shreveport, noticed him looking. He dared Shaftoe to go in there and sit down at that bar. Then another private, Gowicki from Pittsburgh, double-dared him! Shaftoe sucked his teeth and considered the matter. He had already made up his mind that he was going to do it. He was a sniper scout, and it was in his nature to do crazy shit like this; but it was also part of his training to scan the terrain carefully before venturing in. The restaurant was three-quarters full, and everyone in the place was a uniformed member of the Nipponese military. At the bar where the man was cutting up the apparently raw fish, there was a marked concentration of officers; if you only had one grenade, that's where you'd throw it. Most of the place was filled with long tables where enlisted men sat, drinking noodle soup from steaming urns. Shaftoe paid particular attention to these, because they were the ones who were going to be beating the shit out of him in about sixty seconds. Some were there alone, with reading material. A cluster of them, back in one corner, were paying attention to one fellow who was apparently telling a joke or story. The longer Shaftoe spent reconnoitering the place, the more convinced Rhodes and Gowicki became that he was actually going to do it. They became excited and called for the other Marines, who had gone ahead of them down the block, headed for that whorehouse. Shaftoe saw the others coming back--his tactical reserve. ``What the fuck,'' he said, and went into the restaurant. Behind him, he could hear the others shouting excitedly; they couldn't believe he was doing it. When Shaftoe stepped over the threshold of that Nip restaurant, he passed into the realm of legend. All the Nips looked up at him when he came in the door. If they were surprised, they didn't show it. The chef behind the counter began to holler out some kind of ritual greeting, which faltered and trailed off as he got a look at what had just come in. The fellow in the back of the room--a husky, pink-cheeked Nip--continued telling his joke or story or whatever it was. Shaftoe nodded to no one in particular, then stepped to the nearest empty chair at the bar and sat down. Other Marines would have waited until the whole squad had assembled. Then they would have invaded the restaurant en masse, knocked over a few chairs, spilled some soup. But Shaftoe had seized the initiative before the others could do any such thing and gone in by himself, as a sniper scout was supposed to do. It was not just because he was a sniper scout, though. It was also because he was Bobby Shaftoe, and he was sincerely curious about this place, and if he could, he wanted to spend a few calm minutes in here and learn a few things about it before the fun started. It helped, of course, that Shaftoe was a quiet and contemplative drunk, not a dangerous explosive drunk. He must have reeked of beer (those Krauts in Tsingtao cranked out a brew whose taste took him right back to Wisconsin, and he was homesick). But he wasn't hollering or knocking things over. The chef was busy crafting one of his little morsels and pretended to ignore Shaftoe. The other men at the counter stared coldly at Shaftoe for a while, then turned their attentions back to their food. Shaftoe looked at the array of raw fish laid out on shaved ice behind the bar, then looked around the room. The guy back in the corner was talking in short bursts, reading from a notebook. He would speak maybe ten or twenty words, and then his little audience would turn to one another and grin, or grimace, or sometimes even make a patter of applause. He wasn't delivering his material like a dirty joke. He spoke precisely and expressively. Fuck! He was reading poetry! Shaftoe had no idea what he was saying, but he could tell, by the sound of it, that it must be poetry. Didn't rhyme though. But the Nips did everything queerly. He noticed that the chef was glaring at him. He cleared his throat, which was useless since he couldn't speak Nip. He looked at some of that ruby red fish behind the bar, pointed to it, held up two fingers. Everyone was startled that the American had actually placed an order. The tension was broken, only a little. The chef went to work and produced two morsels, which he served up on a wooden pedestal. Shaftoe had been trained to eat insects, and to bite the heads off chickens, so he figured he could handle this. He picked the morsels up in his fingers, just like the Nips were doing, and ate them. They were good. He ordered two more, of another variety. The guy in the corner kept reading poetry. Shaftoe ate his morsels and then ordered some more. For perhaps ten seconds, between the taste of the fish and the sound of the poetry, he actually felt comfortable here, and forgot that he was merely instigating a vicious racial brawl. The third order looked different: laid over the top of the raw fish were thin translucent sheets of some kind of moist, glistening material. It looked sort of like butcher paper soaked in oil. Shaftoe gawked at it for a while, trying to identify it, but it looked like no foodstuff he knew of. He glanced left and right, hoping that one of the Nips had ordered the same stuff, so that he could watch and learn the right way to eat it. No luck. Hell, they were officers. Maybe one of them spoke a little English. `` 'Scuse me. What's this?'' Shaftoe said, peeling up one corner of the eerie membrane. The chef looked up at him nervously, then scanned the bar, polling the customers. Discussion ensued. Finally, a Nip officer at the end of the bar, a naval lieutenant, stood up and spoke to Bobby Shaftoe. ``Seaweed.'' Shaftoe did not particularly like the lieutenant's tone of voice--hostile and sullen. This, combined with the look on his face, seemed to say, You'll never understand it, you farmer, so why don't you just think of it as seaweed. Shaftoe folded his hands primly in his lap, regarded the seaweed for a few moments, and then looked up at the lieutenant, who was still gazing at him expressionlessly. ``What kind of seaweed, sir?'' he said. Significant glances began flying around the restaurant, like semaphores before a naval engagement. The poetry reading seemed to have stopped, and a migration of enlisted men had begun from the back of the room. Meanwhile the lieutenant translated Shaftoe's inquiry to the others, who discussed it in some detail, as if it were a major policy initiative from Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The lieutenant and the chef exchanged words. Then the lieutenant looked at Shaftoe again. ``He say, you pay now.'' The chef held up one hand and rubbed his fingers and thumb together. A year of working the Yangtze River Patrol had given Bobby Shaftoe nerves of titanium, and unlimited faith in his comrades, and so he resisted the impulse to turn his head and look out the window. He already knew exactly what he would see: Marines, shoulder to shoulder, ready to die for him. He scratched the new tattoo on his forearm: a dragon. His dirty fingernails, passing over the fresh scabs, made a rasping sound in the utterly silent restaurant. ``You didn't answer my question,'' Shaftoe said, pronouncing the words with a drunk's precision. The lieutenant translated this into Nipponese. More discussion. But this time it was curt and decisive. Shaftoe could tell that they were about to bounce him. He squared his shoulders. The Nips were good; they mounted an organized charge out the door, onto the sidewalk, and engaged the Marines, before anyone actually laid a hand on Shaftoe. This spoiling attack prevented the Marines from invading the restaurant proper, which would have disturbed the officers' meal and, with any luck, led to untold property damage. Shaftoe then felt himself being grabbed from behind by at least three people and hoisted into the air. He made eye contact with the lieutenant while this was happening, and shouted: ``Are you bullshitting me about the seaweed?'' As brawls went, the only remarkable part of this one was the way he was carried out to the street before he could actually get started. Then it was like all the other street fights he'd been in with Nip soldiers in Shanghai. These all came down to American brawn (you didn't get picked for the Fourth Regiment unless you were an impressive-looking six-footer) versus that Nipponese chop-socky. Shaftoe wasn't a boxer. He was a wrestler. This was to his advantage. The other Marines would put up their dukes and try to fight it out--Marquis of Queensberry style--no match for chop-socky. Shaftoe had no illusions about his boxing, so he would just put his head down and charge like a bull, take a few blows to the face on his way in, but usually get a solid hold on his opponent and slam him into the cobblestones. Usually that shook the Nip up enough that Shaftoe could get him in a full-nelson or a hammerlock and get him to cry uncle. The guys who were carrying him out of the restaurant got jumped by Marines as soon as they were in the open. Shaftoe found himself going up against an opponent who was at least as tall as he was, which was unusual. This one had a solid build, too. Not like a sumo wrestler. More like a football player--a lineman, with a bit of a gut. He was a strong S.O.B. and Shaftoe knew right away that he was in for a real scrape. The guy had a different style of wrestling from the American, which (as Shaftoe learned the hard way) included some illegal maneuvers: partial strangulation and powerful, short punches to major nerve centers. The gulf between Shaftoe's mind and body, already wedged open by alcohol, was yanked open to a chasm by these techniques. He ended up lying on the sidewalk, helpless and paralyzed, staring up into the chubby face of his opponent. This was (he realized) the same guy who'd been sitting in the corner of the restaurant reading poetry. He was a good wrestler for a poet. Or maybe vice versa. ``It is not seaweed,'' said the big Nip. He had a look on his face like a naughty schoolkid getting away with something. ``The English word is maybe calabash?'' Then he turned and walked back into the restaurant. So much for legend. What none of the other Marines knows is that this was not the last encounter between Bobby Shaftoe and Goto Dengo. The incident left Shaftoe with any number of nagging questions about subjects as diverse as seaweed, poetry, and chop-socky. He sought out Goto Dengo after that, which was not that hard--he just paid some Chinese boys to follow the conspicuous Nip around town and file daily reports. From this he learned that Goto Dengo and some of his comrades gathered every morning in a certain park to practice their chop-socky. After making sure that his will was in order and writing a last letter to his parents and siblings in Oconomowoc, Shaftoe went to that park one morning, reintroduced himself to the surprised Goto Dengo, and made arrangements to serve as human punching bag. They found his self-defense skills hilariously primitive but admired his resilience, and so, for the small cost of a few broken ribs and digits, Bobby Shaftoe got a preliminary course in the particular type of chop-socky favored by Goto Dengo, which is called judo. Over time, this even led to a few social engagements in bars, and restaurants, where Shaftoe learned to recognize four types of seaweed, three types of fish eggs, and several flavors of Nip poetry. Of course he had no idea what the fuck they were saying, but he could count syllables, which, as far as he could tell, is about all there is to Nip poetry appreciation. Not that this--or any other knowledge of their culture--is going to do him any good now that it will soon be his job to kill them. In return, Shaftoe taught Goto Dengo how not to throw like a girl. A lot of the Nips are good at baseball and so it was hilarious, even to them, to see their burly friend pushing ineffectually at a baseball. But it was Shaftoe who taught Goto Dengo to stand sideways, to rotate his shoulders, and to follow through. He's paid a lot of attention to the big Nip's throwing form during the last year, and maybe that's why the image of Goto Dengo planting his feet on the ashlars of the Bund, winding up, throwing the streamer-wrapped grenade, and following through almost daintily on one combat-booted foot stays in Shaftoe's mind all the way to Manila and beyond. A couple of days into the voyage it becomes apparent that Sergeant Frick has forgotten how to shine his boots. Every night he puts them on the deck beside his bunk, like he's expecting a coolie to come around and shine them up during the night. Every morning he wakes up and finds them in a sorrier state than before. After a few days he starts to draw reprimands from On High, starts to get a lot of potato-peeling duty. Now in and of itself this is forgivable. Frick started out his career chasing bandolier-draped desperadoes away from mail trains on the High Chaparral, for God's sake. In '27 he got shipped off to Shanghai on very short notice, and no doubt had to display some adaptability. Fine. And now he's on this miserable pre-Great War cruiser and it's a little hard on him. Fine. But he does not take all of this with the dignity that is demanded of Marines by Marines. He whines about it. He lets himself get humiliated. He gets angry. A lot of the other old China Marines see things his way. One day Bobby Shaftoe is up on the deck of the destroyer tossing the old horsehide around with a couple of the other young Marines when he sees a few of these older guys accumulating into a sort of human booger on the afterdeck. He can tell by the looks on their faces and by their gestures that they are bellyaching. Shaftoe hears a couple of the ship's crew talking to each other nearby. ``What the hell is wrong with those Marines?'' one of them says. The other one shakes his head sadly, like a doctor who has just seen a patient's eyeballs roll up into their sockets. ``Those poor bastards have gone Asiatic,'' he says. And then they turn and look at Shaftoe. That evening, at mess, Bobby Shaftoe gulps his food down double-time, then stands up and approaches the table where those Old Breed Marines are sullenly gathered. ``Begging your pardon, Sergeant!'' he hollers. ``Request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!'' Frick's mouth drops open, revealing a half-chewed plug of boiled beef. ``Whud you say, Corporal?'' The mess has gone silent. ``Respectfully request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!'' Frick is not the quickest guy in the world even when he's sober, and it's pretty obvious, just from looking at his pupils, that he and his comrades have brought some opium aboard. ``Wull, uh, I guess so,'' he says. He looks around at his crew of gripers, who are a little confused and a little amused. He unlaces his boots. Bobby Shaftoe takes those disgraceful things away and returns a bit later with them resplendently shined. By this time, Frick has gotten high and mighty. ``Wull, those boots look real good, Corporal Shaftoe,'' he says in a brassy voice. ``Darned if you ain't as good a shoe-shiner as my coolie boy was.'' At lights out, Frick and crew are short-sheeted. Various other, ruder practical jokes ensue during the nighttime. One of them gets jumped in his bunk and beaten by unspecified attackers. The brass call a surprise inspection the next morning and cuss them out. The ``gone Asiatic'' crew spend most of the next day gathered in a cluster, watching each other's backs. Around midday, Frick finally gets it through his head that all of this was triggered by Shaftoe's gesture, and that Shaftoe knew, all along, what was going to happen. So he rushes Bobby Shaftoe up on the deck and tries to throw him over the rail. Shaftoe's warned at the last minute by one of his compadres, and spins around just enough to throw off Frick's attack. Frick caroms off the rail, turns around, and tries to grab Shaftoe's nuts. Shaftoe pokes him in the eye, which straightens him right up. They back away from each other. The opening formalities having been finished; they put up their dukes. Frick and Shaftoe box for a couple of rounds. A large crowd of Marines gathers. On most of their cards, Frick is winning the fight. Frick was always dim-witted, and is now crazy to boot, but he knows his way around a boxing ring, and he has forty pounds on Shaftoe. Shaftoe puts up with it until Frick socks him pretty hard in the mouth and gives him a bloody lip. ``How far are we from Manila?'' Shaftoe hollers. This question, as usual, leaves Sergeant Frick confused and bewildered, and straightens him up for a moment. ``Two days,'' answers one of the ship's officers. ``Well, goddamn,'' Bobby Shaftoe says. ``How'm I gonna kiss my girl with this fat lip?'' Frick answers, ``Just go out and find a cheaper one.'' That's all he needs. Shaftoe puts his head down and charges in on Frick, hollering like a Nip. Before Frick can get his brain in gear, Bobby Shaftoe has him wrapped up in one of those chop-socky holds that Goto Dengo taught him in Shanghai. He works his way up Frick's body to a choke-hold and then clamps down until Sergeant Frick's lips turn the color of the inside of an oyster shell. Then he hangs Frick over the rail, holding him upside-down by the ankles, until Frick recovers enough to shout, ``Uncle!'' A disciplinary proceeding is hastily called. Shaftoe is found guilty of being courteous (by shining Frick's boots) and defending the life of a Marine (himself) from a crazed attacker. The crazed attacker goes straight to the brig. Within a few hours, the noises Frick makes lets all of the Marines know what opium withdrawal feels like. So Sergeant Frick does not get to see their entrance into Manila Bay. Shaftoe almost feels sorry for the poor bastard. The island of Luzon lies to port all day long, a black hulk barely visible through the haze, with glimpses of palm trees and beaches down below. All of the Marines have been this way before and so they can pick out the Cordillera Central up north, and later the Zambales Mountains, which eventually plunge down to meet the sea near Subic Bay. Subic triggers a barrage of salty anecdotes. The ship does not put in there, but continues to swing southward around Bata'an, turning inland toward the entrance of Manila Bay. The ship reeks of shoe polish, talcum powder, and after-shave lotion; the Fourth Marines may have specialized in whoring and opium abuse, but they've always been known as the best-looking Marines in the Corps. They pass by Corregidor. An island shaped like a bead of water on a waxed boot, it is gently rounded in the middle but steeply sloping into the water. It has a long, bony, dry tail that trails off at one end. The Marines know that the island is riddled with tunnels and bristling with terrible guns, but the only sign of these fortifications is the clusters of concrete barracks up in the hills, housing the men who serve the weapons. A tangle of antennas rises up above Topside. Their shapes are familiar to Shaftoe, because many of the same antennas rose above Station Alpha in Shanghai, and he had to take them apart and load them into the truck. There is a giant limestone cliff descending nearly into the sea, and at the base of it is the entrance to the tunnel where all the spooks and radio men have their hideaway. Nearby is a dock, quite busy at the moment, with supplies being offloaded from civilian transports and stacked right there on the beach. This detail is noticed by all of the Marines as a positive sign of approaching war. Augusta drops anchor in the cove, and all of that tarp-wrapped radio stuff is unloaded into launches and taken to that dock, along with all of the odd pencil-necked Navy men who tended that gear in Shanghai. The swell dies as they pass Corregidor and enter the bay. Greenish-brown algae floats in swirls and curlicues near the surface. Navy ships lay brown ropes of smoke across the still sea. Undisturbed by wind, these unfold into rugged shapes like translucent mountain ranges. They pass the big military base at Cavite--a sheet of land so low and flat that its boundary with the water would be invisible except for the picket line of palm trees. A few hangars and water towers rise from it, and low dark clusters of barracks farther inland. Manila is dead ahead of them, still veiled in haze. It is getting on toward evening. Then the haze dissolves, the atmosphere suddenly becomes as limpid as a child's eyes, and for about an hour they can see to infinity. They are steaming into an arena of immense thunderheads with lightning corkscrewing down through them all around. Flat grey clouds like shards of broken slate peek out between anvils. Behind them are higher clouds vaulting halfway to the moon, glowing pink and salmon in the light of the setting sun. Behind that, more clouds nestled within banks of humidity like Christmas ornaments wrapped in tissue paper, expanses of blue sky, more thunderheads exchanging bolts of lightning twenty miles long. Skies nested within skies nested within skies. It was cold up there in Shanghai, and it's gotten warmer every day since. Some days it's even been hot and muggy. But around the time Manila heaves into view, a warm breeze springs up over the deck and all of the Marines sigh, as if they have all ejaculated in unison. Manila's perfume Fanned by the coconut palms The thighs of Glory Manila's spreading tile roofs have a mestizo shape about them, half-Spanish and half-Chinese. The city has a concave seawall with a flat promenade on the top. Strollers turn and wave to the Marines; some of them blow kisses. A wedding party is gushing down the steps of a church and across the boulevard to the seawall, where they are getting their pictures taken in the flattering peach-colored light of the sunset. The men are in their fancy, gauzy Filipino shirts, or in U.S. military uniforms. The women are in spectacular gowns and dresses. The Marines holler and whistle at them and the women turn towards them, hitching up their skirts slightly so that they won't trip, and wave enthusiastically. The Marines get woozy and practically fall overboard. As their ship is easing into its dock, a crescent-shaped formation of flying fish erupts from the water. It moves away like a dune being blown across the desert. The fish are silver and leaf-shaped. Each one strikes the water with a metallic click, and the clicks merge into a crisp ripping noise. The crescent glides beneath a pier, flowing around its pilings, and disappears in the shadows underneath. Manila, the Pearl of the Orient, early on a Sunday evening, the 7th of December, 1941. In Hawaii, on the other side of the Date Line, it is only just past midnight. Bobby Shaftoe and his comrades have a few hours of freedom. The city is modern, prosperous, English-speaking, and Christian, by far the wealthiest and most advanced city in Asia, practically like being back home in the States. For all its Catholicity, it has areas that seem to have been designed, from the foundation-stones upwards, to the specifications of horny sailors. You get to those parts of town by turning right once your feet are on dry land. Bobby Shaftoe turns left, politely excuses himself past a legion of excited prostitutes, and sets his course on the looming walls of Intramuros. He stops only to buy a sheaf of roses from a vendor in the park, who is doing land-office business. The park and the walls above it are crowded with strolling lovers, the men mostly in uniforms and the women in demure but stunning dresses, twirling parasols on their shoulders. A couple of fellows driving horse-drawn taxis want to do business with Bobby Shaftoe but he turns them down. A taxi will only get him there faster, and he is too nervous to get there fast. He walks through a gate in the wall and into the old Spanish city. Intramuros is a maze of buff-colored stone walls rising abruptly from narrow streets. The first-floor windows along the sidewalks are guarded by black ironwork cages. The bars swell, swirl, and sprout finedly hammered leaves. The second stories hang out overhead, sporting gas lights that are just now being lit by servants with long, smoking poles. The sound of laughter and music drifts out of the windows above, and when he passes by the archways that open into the inner courtyards, he can smell flowers back in the gardens. Damned if he can tell these places apart. He remembers the street name of Magallanes, because Glory told him once it was the same thing as ``Magellan.'' And he remembers the view of the cathedral from the Pascuals' window. He wanders around a block a couple of times, certain that he is close. Then he hears an exaltation of girlish laughter coming from a second-story window, and moves toward it like a jellyfish sucked into an intake pipe. It all comes together. This is the place. The girls are all gossiping, in English, about one of their instructors. He does not hear Glory's voice but he thinks he hears her laughter. ``Glory!'' he says. Then he says it louder. If they hear him, they pay him no mind. Finally he winds up and flings the bouquet of roses like a potato-masher grenade over the wooden railing, through a narrow gap between the mother-of-pearl shutters, and into the room. Miraculous silence from within the room, and then gales of laughter. The nacre shutters part with slow, agonizing coyness. A girl of nineteen steps out onto the balcony. She is dressed in the uniform of a nursing student. It is as white as starlight shining on the North Pole. She has let her long black hair down to brush it, and it stirs languidly in the evening breeze. The last ruddy light of the sunset makes her face glow like a coal. She hides behind the bouquet for a moment, buries her nose in it, inhales deeply, peeking out at him over the blossoms with her black eyes. Then she lowers the bouquet gradually to reveal her high cheeks, her perfect little nose, the fantastic sculpture of her lips, and teeth, white but fetchingly crooked, barely visible. She is smiling. ``Jesus H. Christ,'' Bobby Shaftoe says, ``your cheekbones are like a fucking snowplow.'' She puts her finger to her lips. The gesture of anything touching Glory's lips puts an invisible spear through Shaftoe's chest. She eyes him for a while, establishing, in her own mind, that she has the boy's attention and that he is not going anywhere. Then she turns her back on him. The light grazes her buttocks, showing nothing but suggesting cleavage. She goes back inside and the shutter glides shut behind her. Suddenly the room full of girls becomes quiet, except for occasional ripples of suppressed laughter. Shaftoe bites his tongue. They are screwing it all up. Mr. or Mrs. Pascual will notice their silence and become suspicious. Ironwork clangs and a big gate swings open. The porter beckons him inside. Shaftoe follows the old fellow down the black, arched tunnel of the porte-cochere. The hard soles of his shiny black shoes skid on the cobblestones. A horse back in the stable whinnies at the smell of his aftershave. Sleepy American music, slow-dance stuff from the Armed Forces station, spills tinnily from a radio in the porter's nook. Flowering vines grow up the stone walls of the courtyard. It is a tidy, quiet, enclosed world, almost like being indoors. The porter waves him in the direction of one of the stairways that lead up to the second floor. Glory calls it the entresuelo and says that it's really a floor between the floors, but it looks like a full-fledged, regular floor to Bobby Shaftoe. He mounts the steps and looks up to see Mr. Pascual standing there, a tiny bald man with glasses and a trim little mustache. He is wearing a short-sleeved shirt, American style, and khaki trousers, and slippers, and is holding a glass of San Miguel in one hand and a cigarette in the other. ``Private Shaftoe! Welcome back,'' he says. So. Glory has decided to play this one by the book. The Pascuals have been alerted. A few hours of socializing now stand between Bobby Shaftoe and his girl. But a Marine is never fazed by such setbacks. ``Begging your pardon, Mr. Pascual, but I am a corporal now.'' Mr. Pascual puts his cigarette in his mouth and shakes Corporal Shaftoe's hand. ``Well, congratulations! I just saw your uncle Jack last week. I don't think he had any idea you were on your way back.'' ``It was a surprise to everyone, sir,'' Bobby Shaftoe says. Now they are on a raised walkway that runs around the courtyard. Only livestock and servants live at ground level. Mr. Pascual leads them around to a door that takes them into the entresuelo. The walls here are rough stone, the ceilings are simple painted planks. They pass through a dark, somber office where Mr. Pascual's father and grandfather used to receive the managers of the family's haciendas and plantations. For a moment, Bobby Shaftoe gets his hopes up. This level has a few rooms that back in the old days were apartments for high-ranking servants, bachelor uncles, and spinster aunts. Now that the hacienda business ain't what it used to be, the Pascuals are renting them out to female students. Perhaps Mr. Pascual is leading him directly to Glory. But this goes the way of all foolish, horny illusions as Shaftoe finds himself at the foot of a vast staircase of polished nara wood. He can see pressed-tin ceiling up there, chandeliers, and the imposing superstructure of Mrs. Pascual, contained within a mighty bodice that looks like something dreamed up by naval engineers. They ascend the stairs into the antesala, which according to Glory is strictly for casual, drop-in visitors but is fancier than any room Bobby Shaftoe has ever seen. There are big vases and pots all over the place, supposedly old, and supposedly from Japan and China. A fresh breeze runs through; he looks out a window and sees, neatly framed in it, the green dome of the cathedral with its Celtic cross on top, just as he remembered it. Mrs. Pascual holds out her hand and Shaftoe clasps it. ``Mrs. Pascual,'' he says, ``thank you for welcoming me into your home.'' ``Please sit down,'' she says, ``we want to hear everything.'' Shaftoe sits in a fancy chair next to the piano, adjust his trousers a bit so that they will not cramp his erect penis, checks his shave. It probably has a few good hours left. A wing of airplanes drones overhead. Mrs. Pascual is giving instructions to the maid in Tagalog. Shaftoe examines the crusted lacerations on his knuckles and wonders whether Mrs. Pascual has the slightest idea of what she would be in for if he really told her everything. Perhaps a little anecdote about hand-to-hand combat with Chinese river pirates on the banks of the Yangtze would break the ice. Through a door and down the hall, he can see a corner of the family chapel, all Gothic arches, a gilded altar, and in front of it an embroidered kneeler worn threadbare by the patellas of Mrs. Pascual. Cigarettes are brought round, stacked in a large lacquer box like artillery shells in a crate. They drink tea and exchange small talk for what seems like about thirty-six hours. Mrs. Pascual wants to be reassured, over and over again, that everything is fine and that there will not be a war. Mr. Pascual obviously believes that war is just around the corner, and mostly broods. Business has been good lately. He and Jack Shaftoe, Bobby's uncle, have been shipping a lot of stuff between here and Singapore. But business will get a lot worse soon, he thinks. Glory appears. She has changed out of her student's uniform and into a dress. Bobby Shaftoe nearly topples backward out of the window. Mrs. Pascual formally reintroduces them. Bobby Shaftoe kisses Glory's hand in what he thinks is more than likely a very gallant gesture. He's glad he did, because Glory is palming a tiny wadded-up note which ends up in his hand. Glory takes a seat and is duly issued her own teacup. Another eternity of small talk. Mr. Pascual asks him for the eighty-seventh time whether he has touched base with Uncle Jack yet, and Shaftoe reiterates that he literally just stepped off the boat and will certainly see Uncle Jack tomorrow morning. He excuses himself to the bathroom, which is an old-fashioned two-holer mounted above deep shafts that must descend all the way to hell. He unwads and reads Glory's note, memorizes the instructions, tears it up and sprinkles it down the hole. Mrs. Pascual allows the two young lovers a full half hour of ``private'' time together, meaning that the Pascuals leave the room and only come back every five minutes or so to check up on them. There is a painfully elaborate and lengthy good-bye ceremony which ends in Shaftoe returning to the street and Glory waving to him from her balcony. Half an hour later, they are doing tongue judo in the back of a horse-drawn taxi galloping over the cobblestones toward the nightclubs of Malate. The extraction of Glory from the Pascual residence was a simple matter for a highly motivated China Marine and a squadron of saucy nursing students. But Glory must be kissing him with her eyes open because all of a sudden she wriggles loose and says to the taxi driver, ``Stop! Please stop, sir!'' ``What is it?'' Shaftoe says blurrily. He looks around and sees nothing but a great big old stone church looming up above them. This brings a preliminary stab of fear. But the church is dark, there's no Filipinas in long dresses, no Marines in dress uniforms, it can't be his wedding. ``I want to show you something,'' Glory says, and clambers down out of the taxi. Shaftoe has to pursue her into the place--the Church of San Augustin. He's gone by this pile many times but he never reckoned he would come inside--on a date. She stands at the bottom of a huge staircase and says, ``See?'' Shaftoe looks up into darkness, thinks there might be a stained-glass window or two up there, maybe a Laceration of Christ or an Impalement of the Blessed Thorax, but-- ``Look down,'' Glory says, and taps one miniature foot against the first tread of the staircase. It is a single great big huge slab of granite. ``Looks like ten or twenty tons of rock there I'd estimate,'' he says authoritatively. ``It came from Mexico.'' ``Ah, go on!'' Glory smiles at him. ``Carry me up the stairs.'' And in case Shaftoe's thinking of refusing, she sort of falls into him, and he has no choice but to catch her up in his arms. She traps his nape in the crook of her arm, the better to pull her face close to his, but what he remembers is how the silk of her sleeve feels against the freshly shaved skin of his neck. He begins the ascent. Glory doesn't weigh much, but after four steps he has broken a fine sweat. She is watching him, from four inches away, for signs of fatigue, and he feels himself blushing. Good thing that the whole staircase is lit up by about two candles. There's a lovely bust of a thorn-crowned Jesus with long parallel blood-drops running down his face, and on the right-- ``These giant stones you are walking on were quarried in Mexico, centuries and centuries ago, before America was even a country. They were brought over in the bottoms of the Manila Galleons, as ballast.'' She pronounces it bayast. ``I'll be damned.'' ``When those galleons arrived, the stones were brought out of their bellies, one by one, and taken here to the Church of San Agustin, and piled up. Each stone on top of the last year's stone. Until finally after many, many years this staircase was finished.'' After a while it seems to Shaftoe as though it's going to take at least that many years to reach the top of the damn thing. The summit is adorned with a life-sized Jesus carrying a cross that appears to be at least as heavy as one of those stair-treads. So who's he to complain? Then Glory says, ``Now carry me down, so you will remember the story.'' ``You think I'm some horny jarhead who won't remember a story unless it's got a pretty girl in it?'' ``Yes,'' Glory says, and laughs in his face. He carries her down to the bottom again. Then, before she goes off on some other tangent, he carries her straight out the door and into the taxi. Bobby Shaftoe is not one to lose his cool in the heat of action, but the rest of the evening is a blurry fever dream to him. Only a few impressions penetrate the haze: alighting from the taxi in front of a waterfront hotel; all of the other boys gaping at Glory; Bobby Shaftoe glaring at them, threatening to teach them some manners. Slow dancing with Glory in the ballroom, Glory's silk-clad thigh gradually slipping between his legs, her firm body pressing harder and harder against his. Strolling along the seawall, hand in hand beneath the starlight. Noticing that the tide is out. Exchanging a look. Carrying her down from the seawall to the thin strip of rocky beach beneath it. By the time he is actually fucking her, he has more or less lost consciousness, he is off in some fantastic, libidinal dream. He and Glory fuck without the slightest hesitation, without any doubts, without any troublesome thinking whatsoever. Their bodies have spontaneously merged, like a pair of drops running together on a windowpane. If he is thinking anything at all, it is that his entire life has culminated in this moment. His upbringing in Oconomowoc, high school prom night, deer hunting in the Upper Peninsula, Parris Island boot camp, all of the brawls and struggles in China, his duel with Sergeant Frick, they are wood behind the point of a spear. Sirens are blowing somewhere. He startles back to awareness. Has he been here all night long, holding Glory up against the seawall, her thighs wrapped around his waist? That would not be possible. The tide hasn't come in at all. ``What is it?'' she says. Her hands are clasped around the back of his neck. She lets go and runs them down his chest. Still holding her up, his hands making a sling under her warm and flawless ass, Shaftoe backs away from the seawall and turns around on the beach, looking at the sky. He sees searchlights beginning to come on. And it ain't no Hollywood premiere. ``It's war, baby,'' he says. FORAYS The lobby of the manila hotel is about the size of a football field. It smells like last year's perfume, rare tropical orchids, and bug spray. There is a metal detector set up at the front door, because the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe happens to be staying here for a couple of days. Big Africans in good suits stand around the place in clusters of two and three. Mini-throngs of Nipponese tourists, in their Bermuda shorts, sandals and white socks, have lodged themselves in the deep, thick, wide sofas and sit quietly, waiting for a prearranged signal. Upper-class Filipino children brandish cylindrical potato chip canisters like tribal chieftains carrying ceremonial maces. A dignified old bellman carrying a hand-pumped tank circulates around the defensive perimeter and silently sprays insecticide against the baseboard. Enter Randall Lawrence Waterhouse, in a turquoise polo shirt embroidered with the logo of one of the bankrupt high-tech companies that he and Avi have founded, and relaxed-fit blue jeans held up with suspenders, and bulky athletic shoes that once were white. As soon as he got through the formalities at the airport, he perceived that the Philippines are, like Mexico, one of those countries where Shoes Matter. He approaches the registration counter quickly so that the ravishing young woman in the navy-blue uniform will not see his feet. A couple of bellhops are engaged in a pathetic, Sisyphean contest with his bag, which has roughly the dimensions and mass of a two-drawer filing cabinet. ``You will not be able to find technical books there,'' Avi told him, ``bring anything you might conceivably need.'' Randy's suite is a bedroom and living room, both with fourteen-foot ceilings, and a corridor along one side containing several closets and various plumbing-related technologies. The entire thing is lined in some kind of tropical hardwood stained to a lovely glowing auburn, which would be dismal in the northern latitudes but, here, gives it a cozy and cool feeling. The two main rooms each have huge windows with tiny signs by the latch handles warning of tropical insects. Each room is defended from its windows by a multilayered system of interlocking barriers: incredibly massive wooden shutters that rumble back and forth on tracks, like freight trains maneuvering in a switching yard; a second layer of shutters consisting of two-inch squares of nacre held in a polished wooden grid, sliding on its own set of tracks; window sheers, and finally, heavy-gauge blackout curtains, each suspended from its own set of clanging industrial rails. He orders up a large pot of coffee, which barely keeps him awake long enough to unpack. It is late afternoon. Purple clouds tumble out of the surrounding mountains with the palpable momentum of volcanic mudflows and turn half of the sky into a blank wall striped with vertical bolts of lightning; the walls of the hotel room flash with it as though paparazzi are working outside the window. Below, food vendors in Rizal Park run up and down the sidewalks to get out of the rain, which falls, as it has been doing for about half a millennium, on the sloping black walls of Intramuros. If those walls did not run in straight lines they could be mistaken for a natural freak of geology: ridges of bare, dark volcanic rock erupting from the grass like teeth from gums. The walls have dovetail-shaped notches that converge to old gun emplacements, providing interlocking fields of fire across a dry moat. Living in the States, you never see anything older than about two and a half centuries, and you have to visit the eastern fringe of the country to see that. The business traveler's world of airports and taxicabs looks the same everywhere. Randy never really believes he's in a different country until he sees something like Intramuros, and then he has to stand there like an idiot for a long time, ruminating. Right now, across the Pacific Ocean, in a small, tasteful Victorian town located a third of the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles, computers are seizing up, crucial files are disappearing, and e-mail is careening into intergalactic space, because Randy Waterhouse is not there to keep an eye on things. The town in question sports three small colleges: one founded by the State of California and two founded by Protestant denominations that are now actively reviled by the majority of their faculty. Taken together these colleges--the Three Siblings--comprise an academic center of middling importance. Their computer systems are linked into one. They exchange teachers and students. From time to time they host academic conferences. This part of California has beaches, mountains, redwood forests, vineyards, golf courses, and sprawling penal facilities all over the place. There are plenty of three- and four-star hotel rooms, and the Three Siblings, taken together, have enough auditoria and meeting rooms to host a conference of several thousand. Avi's telephone call, some eighty hours ago, arrived in the middle of a major interdisciplinary conference called ``The Intermediate Phase (1939›45) of the Global Hegemony Struggle of the Twentieth Century (Common Era).'' This is a bit of a mouthful and so it has been given a pithy nickname: ``War as Text.'' People are coming from places like Amsterdam and Milan. The conference's organizing committee--which includes Randy's girlfriend, Charlene, who actually gives every indication of being his ex-girlfriend now--hired an artist in San Francisco to come up with a poster. He started with a black-and-white halftone photo of a haggard World War Two infantryman with a cigarette dangling from his lower lip. He worked this image over using a photocopier, blowing the halftone dots up into rough lumps, like rubber balls chewed by a dog, and wreaking any number of other distortions on it until it had an amazingly stark, striking, jagged appearance; the soldier's pale eyes turned an eerie white. Then he added a few elements in color: red lipstick, blue eyeshadow, and a trace of a red brassiere strap peeking out from the soldier's unbuttoned uniform shirt. The poster won some kind of an award almost the moment it came out. This led to a press release, which in turn led to the poster's being enshrined by the news media as an Official Object of Controversy. An enterprising journalist managed to track down the soldier depicted in the original photograph--a decorated combat veteran and retired tool-and-die maker who, as it happened, was not merely alive but in excellent health, and, since the death of his wife from breast cancer, had spent his retirement roaming around the Deep South in his pickup truck, helping to rebuild black churches that had been torched by drunken yahoos. The artist who had designed the poster then confessed that he had simply copied it from a book and had made no effort whatsoever to obtain permission--the entire concept of getting permission to use other people's work was faulty, since all art was derivative of other art. High-powered trial lawyers converged, like dive bombers, on the small town in Kentucky where the aggrieved veteran was up on the roof of a black church with a mouthful of nails, hammering down slabs of A/D exterior plywood and mumbling ``no comment'' to a horde of reporters down on the lawn. After a series of conferences in a room at the town's Holiday Inn, the veteran emerged, accompanied by one of the five most famous lawyers on the face of the planet, and announced that he was filing a civil suit against the Three Siblings that would, if it succeeded, turn them and their entire community into a flat, smoking abrasion in the earth's crust. He promised to split the proceeds between the black churches and various disabled veterans' and breast cancer research groups. The organizing committee pulled the poster from circulation, which caused thousands of bootleg copies to go up on the World Wide Web and, in general, brought it to the attention of millions who never would have seen it otherwise. They also filed suit against the artist, whose net worth could be tallied up on the back of a ticket stub: he had assets of about a thousand dollars and debts (mostly student loans) amounting to sixty-five thousand. All of this happened before the conference even began. Randy was aware of it only because Charlene had roped him into providing computer support for the conference, which meant setting up a Web site and e-mail access for the attendees. When all of this hit the news, e-mail began to flood in, and quickly jammed up all of the lines and filled up all of the disk capacity that Randy had spent the last month setting up. Conferees began to arrive. A lot of them seemed to be sleeping in the house where Randy and Charlene had been living together for seven years. It was a big old Victorian house and there was plenty of room. They stumbled in from Heidelberg and Paris and Berkeley and Boston, then sat around Randy and Charlene's kitchen table drinking coffee and talking at great length about the Spectacle. Randy inferred that the Spectacle meant the poster furor, but as they went on and on about it, he sensed that they were using the word not in a conventional sense but as part of some academic jargon; that it carried a heavy load of shadings and connotations to them, none of which Randy would ever understand unless he became one of them. To Charlene, and to all of the people attending War as Text, it was self-evident that the veteran who filed the lawsuit was the very worst kind of human being--just the sort they had gathered together to debunk, burn in effigy, and sweep into the ash-bin of posthistorical discourse. Randy had spent a lot of time around these people, and thought he'd gotten used to them, but during those days he had a headache all the time, from clenching his teeth, and he kept jumping to his feet in the middle of meals or conversations and going out for solitary walks. This was partly to keep himself from saying something undiplomatic, and partly as a childish but fruitless tactic to get the attention he craved from Charlene. He knew the whole poster saga was going to be a disaster from early on. He kept warning Charlene and the others. They listened coolly, clinically, as if Randy were a test subject on the wrong side of a one-way mirror. Randy forces himself to stay awake long enough for it to get dark. Then he lies in bed for a few hours trying to sleep. The container port is just north of the hotel, and all night long, Rizal Boulevard, along the base of the old Spanish wall, is jammed from one end to the other with container-carrying semis. The whole city is a cauldron of internal combustion. Manila seems to have more pistons and exhaust pipes than the rest of the world combined. Even at two in the morning the hotel's seemingly unshakable mass hums and rattles from the seismic energy pouring from all of those motors. The noise detonates car alarms down in the hotel's lot. The noise of one alarm triggers others, and so on. It is not the noise that keeps Randy awake so much as the insane stupidity of this chain reaction. It is an object lesson: the kind of nightmarish, snowballing technological fuck-up that keeps hackers awake at night even when they can't hear the results. He paws open a Heineken from his minibar and stands in front of the window, looking. Many of the trucks are adorned with brilliant displays of multicolored lights--not quite as flashy as those of the few jeepneys that scurry and jostle among them. Seeing so many people awake and working puts sleep out of the question. He is too jet-lagged to accomplish anything that requires actual thought--but there is one important job he can do, which requires no thinking whatsoever. He starts up his laptop again. Seeming to levitate in the center of his dark room, the screen is a perfect rectangle of light the color of diluted milk, of a Nordic dawn. This light originates in small fluorescent tubes imprisoned in the polycarbonate coffin of his computer's display. It can only escape through a pane of glass, facing Randy, which is entirely covered by small transistors arranged in a grid, which let photons through, or don't, or let through only those of a particular wavelength, cracking the pale light into colors. By turning those transistors on and off according to some systematic plan, meaning is conveyed to Randy Waterhouse. A good filmmaker could convey a whole story to Randy by seizing control of those transistors for a couple of hours. Unfortunately, there are a lot more laptop computers floating around than there are filmmakers worth paying attention to. The transistors are almost never put into the hands of human beings. They are controlled, instead, by software. Randy used to be fascinated by software, but now he isn't. It's hard enough to find human beings who are interesting. The pyramid and the eyeball appear. Randy spends so much time using Ordo now that he has his machine boot it up automatically. Nowadays the laptop has only one function for Randy: he uses it to communicate with other people, through e-mail. When he communicates with Avi, he has to use Ordo, which is a tool for taking his ideas and converting them into streams of bits that are almost indistinguishable from white noise, so that they can be sent to Avi in privacy. In exchange, it receives noise from Avi and converts it into Avi's thoughts. At the moment, Epiphyte has no assets other than information--it is an idea, with some facts and data to back it up. This makes it eminently stealable. So encryption is definitely a good idea. The question is: how much paranoia is really appropriate? Avi sent him encrypted e-mail: When you get to Manila I would like you to generate a 4096-bit key pair and keep it on a floppy disk that you carry on your person at all times. Do not keep it on your hard disk. Anyone could break into your hotel room while you're out and steal that key. Now, Randy pulls down a menu and picks an item labeled: ``New key. . . . '' A box pops up giving him several KEY LENGTH options: 768 bits, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, or Custom. Randy picks the latter option and then, wearily, types in 4096. Even a 768-bit key requires vast resources to break. Add one bit, to make it 769 bits long, and it becomes twice as difficult. A 770-bit key is twice as difficult yet, and so on. By using 768-bit keys, Randy and Avi could keep their communications secret from nearly every entity in the world for at least the next several years. A 1024-bit key would be vastly, astronomically more difficult to break. Some people go so far as to use keys 2048 or even 3072 bits in length. These will stop the very best codebreakers on the face of the earth for astronomical periods of time, barring the invention of otherworldly technologies such as quantum computers. Most encryption software--even stuff written by extremely security-conscious cryptography experts--can't even handle keys larger than that. But Avi insists on using Ordo, generally considered the best encryption software in the world, because it can handle keys of unlimited length--as long as you don't mind waiting for it to crunch all the numbers. Randy begins typing. He is not bothering to look at the screen; he is staring out the window at the lights on the trucks and the jeepneys. He is only using one hand, just flailing away loosely at the keyboard. Inside Randy's computer is a precise clock. Whenever he strikes a key, Ordo uses that clock to record the current time, down to microseconds. He hits a key at 03:05:56.935788 and he hits another one at 03:05:57.290664, or about .354876 seconds later. Another .372307 seconds later, he hits another one. Ordo keeps track of all of these intervals and discards the more significant digits (in this example the .35 and the .37) because these parts will tend to be similar from one event to the next. Ordo wants randomness. It only wants the least significant digits--say, the 76 and the 07 at the very ends of these numbers. It wants a whole lot of random numbers, and it wants them to be very, very random. It is taking somewhat random numbers and feeding them through hash functions that make them even more random. It is running statistical routines on the results to make sure that they contain no hidden patterns. It has breathtakingly high standards for randomness, and it will not stop asking Randy to whack on the keyboard until those standards are met. The longer the key you are trying to generate, the longer this takes. Randy is trying to generate one that is ridiculously long. He has pointed out to Avi, in an encrypted e-mail message, that if every particle of matter in the universe could be used to construct one single cosmic supercomputer, and this computer was put to work trying to break a 4096-bit encryption key, it would take longer than the lifespan of the universe. ``Using today's technology,'' Avi shot back, ``that is true. But what about quantum computers? And what if new mathematical techniques are developed that can simplify the factoring of large prime numbers?'' ``How long do you want these messages to remain secret?'' Randy asked, in his last message before leaving San Francisco. ``Five years? Ten years? Twenty-five years?'' After he got to the hotel this afternoon, Randy decrypted and read Avi's answer. It is still hanging in front of his eyes, like the afterimage of a strobe: I want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil. The computer finally beeps. Randy rests his tired hand. Ordo politely warns him that it may be busy for a while, and then goes to work. It is searching the cosmos of pure numbers, looking for two big primes that can be multiplied by each other to produce a number 4096 bits long. If you want your secrets to remain secret past the end of your life expectancy, then, in order to choose a key length, you have to be a futurist. You have to anticipate how much faster computers will get during this time. You must also be a student of politics. Because if the entire world were to become a police state obsessed with recovering old secrets, then vast resources might be thrown at the problem of factoring large prime numbers. So the length of the key that you use is, in and of itself, a code of sorts. A knowledgeable government eavesdropper, noting Randy's and Avi's use of a 4096-bit key, will conclude one of the following: --Avi doesn't know what he's talking about. This can be ruled out with a bit of research into his past accomplishments. Or, --Avi is clinically paranoid. This can also be ruled out with some research. Or, --Avi is extremely optimistic about the future development of computer technology, or pessimistic about the political climate, or both. Or, --Avi has a planning horizon that extends over a period of at least a century. Randy paces around his room while his computer soars through number space. The shipping containers on the backs of those trucks bear exactly the same logos as the ones that used to fill the streets of South Seattle when a ship was unloading. To Randy this is oddly satisfying, as if, by making this crazy lunge across the Pacific, he has brought some kind of antipodal symmetry to his life. He has gone from the place where things are consumed to where they are produced, from a land where onanism has been enshrined at the highest levels of the society to one where cars have ``NO to contraception!'' stickers in their windows. It feels bizarrely right. He has not felt this way since Avi and he founded their first doomed business venture twelve years ago. Randy grew up in a college town in eastern Washington State, graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, and landed a Clerk Typist II job at the library there--specifically the Interlibrary Loan Department--where his job was to process incoming loan requests mailed in from smaller libraries all over the region and, conversely, to mail out requests to other libraries. If nine-year-old Randy Waterhouse had been able to look into the future and see himself in this career, he would have been delighted beyond measure: the primary tool of the Interlibrary Loan Department was the Staple Remover. Young Randy had seen one of these devices in the hands of his fourth-grade teacher and been enthralled by its cunning and deadly appearance, so like the jaws of some futuristic robot dragon. He had, in fact, gone out of his way to staple things incorrectly just so he could prevail on his teacher to unstaple them, giving him another glimpse of the blood-chilling mandibles in action. He had gone so far as to steal a staple remover from an untended desk at church and then incorporate it into an Erector-set robot hunter-killer device with which he terrorized much of the neighborhood; its pit-viper yawn separated many a cheap plastic toy from its parts and accessories before the theft was discovered and Randy made an example of before God and man. Now, in the Interlibrary Loan office, Randy had not just one but several staple removers in his desk drawer and was actually obligated to use them for an hour or two a day. Since the UW library was well-endowed, its patrons didn't request books from other libraries unless they had been stolen from their own or were, in some way, peculiar. The ILL office (as Randy and his coworkers affectionately called it) had its regulars--people who had a whole lot of peculiar books on their wish lists. These people tended to be either tedious or scary or both. Randy always ended up dealing with the ``both'' subgroup, because Randy was the only Clerk Typist in the office who was not a lifer. It seemed clear that Randy, with his astronomy degree and his extensive knowledge of computers, would one day move on, whereas his coworkers did not harbor further ambitions. His larger sphere of interests, his somewhat broader concept of normalcy, was useful when certain patrons came into the office. By the standards of many, Randy was himself a tedious, scary, obsessed character. He was not merely obsessed with science but also with fantasy role-playing games. The only way he could tolerate working at such a stupid job for a couple of years was that his off time was completely occupied with enacting fantasy scenarios of a depth and complexity that exercised all of the cranial circuitry that was so conspicuously going to waste in the ILL office. He was part of a group that would meet every Friday night and play until sometime on Sunday. The other stalwarts in the group were a computer science/music double major named Chester, and a history grad student named Avi. When a new master's degree candidate named Andrew Loeb walked into the ILL office one day, with a certain glint in his eye, and produced a three-inch-thick stack of precisely typed request forms from his shitty old knapsack, he was recognized immediately as being of a particular type, and shunted in the direction of Randy Waterhouse. It was an instant meeting of minds, though Randy did not fully realize this until the books that Loeb had requested began to arrive on the trolley from the mail room. Andy Loeb's project was to figure out the energy budgets of the local Indian tribes. A human body has to expend a certain amount of energy just to keep breathing and to maintain its body temperature. This figure goes up when it gets cold or when the body in question is doing work. The only way to obtain that energy is by eating food. Some foods have a higher energy content than others. For example, trout is highly nutritious but so low in fat and carbohydrates that you can starve to death eating it three times a day. Other foods might have lots of energy, but might require so much work to obtain and prepare that eating them would be a losing proposition, BTU-wise. Andy Loeb was trying to figure out what foods had historically been eaten by certain Northwest Indian tribes, how much energy they expended to get these foods and how much they obtained by eating them. He wanted to do this calculation for coastal Indians like the Salish (who had easy access to seafood) and for inland ones like the Cayuse (who didn't) as part of an extremely convoluted plan to prove some sort of point about the relative standards of living of these tribes and how this affected their cultural development (coastal tribes made lots of fantastically detailed art and inland ones occasionally scratched stick figures on rocks). To Andrew Loeb it was an exercise in meta-historical scholarship. To Randy Waterhouse, it sounded like the beginnings of a pretty cool game. Strangle a muskrat and you get 136 Energy Points. Lose the muskrat and your core temp drops another degree. Andy was nothing if not methodical and so he had simply looked up every book that had ever been written on such topics, and every book mentioned in those books' bibliographies, yea, even unto four or five generations; checked out all of them that were available locally; and ordered the rest from ILL. All of the latter passed across Randy's desk. Randy read some and skimmed all. He got to learn about how much blubber the Arctic explorers had to eat in order to keep from starving to death. He perused detailed specifications for Army C-rations. After a while, he actually began sneaking into the photocopy room and making copies of key data. In order to run a realistic fantasy role-playing game, you had to keep track of how much food the imaginary characters were getting and how much trouble was involved in getting it. Characters passing across the Gobi desert in November of the year 5000 B.C. would have to spend more time worrying about food than, say, ones who were traveling across central Illinois in 1950. Randy was hardly the first game designer to notice this. There were a few incredibly stupid games in which you didn't have to think about food, but Randy and his friends disdained them. In all of the games that he participated in, or that he himself designed, you had to devote a realistic amount of effort to getting food for your character. But it was not easy to determine what was realistic. Like most designers, Randy got over the problem by slapping together a few rudimentary equations that he basically just pulled out of thin air. But in the books, articles, and dissertations that Andrew Loeb was borrowing through ILL, he found exactly the raw data that a mathematically inclined person would need to come up with a sophisticated rules system based on scientific fact. Stimulating all of the physical processes going on in each character's body was out of the question, especially in a game where you might be dealing with armies of a hundred thousand men. Even a crude simulation, tracking only a few variables and using simple equations, would involve a nightmarish amount of paperwork if you did it all by hand. But all of this was happening in the mid-1980s, when personal computers had become cheap and ubiquitous. A computer could automatically track a large database and tell you whether each character was well-fed or starving. There was no reason not to do it on a computer. Unless, like Randy Waterhouse, you had such a shitty job that you couldn't afford a computer. Of course, there's a way to dodge any problem. The university had lots of computers. If Randy could get an account on one of them, he could write his program there and run it for free. Unfortunately, accounts were only available to students or faculty members, and Randy was neither. Fortunately, he started dating a grad student named Charlene at just about this time. How the hell did a generally keg-shaped guy, a hard scientist, working a dead-end Clerk Typist job, and spending all his spare time in the consummately nerdy pastime of fantasy role-playing games, end up in a relationship with a slender and not unattractive young liberal arts student who spent her spare time sea kayaking and going to foreign films? It must have been one of those opposites-attract kind of deals, a complementary relationship. They met, naturally, in the ILL office, where the highly intelligent but steady and soothing Randy helped the highly intelligent but scattered and flighty Charlene organize a messy heap of loan requests. He should have asked her out then and there, but he was shy. Second and third opportunities came along when the books she'd requested began to filter up from the mailroom, and finally he asked her out and they went to see a film together. Both of them turned out to be not just willing but eager, and possibly even desperate. Before they knew it, Randy had given Charlene a key to his apartment, and Charlene had given Randy the password to her free university computer account, and everything was just delightful. The university computer system was better than no computer at all. But Randy was humiliated. Like every other high-powered academic computing network, this one was based on an industrial-strength operating system called UNIX, which had a learning curve like the Matterhorn, and lacked the cuddly and stylish features of the personal computers then coming into vogue. Randy had used it quite a bit as an undergraduate and knew his way around. Even so, learning how to write good code on the thing required a lot of time. His life had changed when Charlene had come along, and now it changed more: he dropped out of the fantasy role-playing game circuit altogether, stopped going to meetings of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and began to spend all of his free time either with Charlene or in front of a computer terminal. All in all, this was probably a change for the better. With Charlene, he did things he wouldn't have done otherwise, like getting exercise, or going to see live music. And at the computer, he was learning new skills, and he was creating something. It might be something completely useless, but at least he was creating. He spent a lot of time talking to Andrew Loeb, who actually went out and did the stuff he was writing programs for; he'd disappear for a few days and come back all wobbly and haggard, with fish scales caught in his whiskers or dried animal blood under his fingernails. He'd ram down a couple of Big Macs, sleep for twenty-four hours, then meet Randy in a bar (Charlene wasn't comfortable with having him in the house) and talk learnedly of the difficulties of day-to-day life, aboriginal style. They argued about whether aborigines would eat the more disgusting parts of certain animals or throw them away. Andrew voted for yes. Randy disagreed--just because they were primitive didn't mean they couldn't have taste. Andrew accused him of being a romantic. Finally, to settle it, they went up into the mountains together, armed with nothing but knives and Andrew's collection of exquisitely crafted vermin snares. By the third night, Randy found himself seriously thinking about eating some insects. ``Q.E.D.,'' Andrew said. Anyway, Randy finished his software after a year and a half. It was a success; Chester and Avi liked it. Randy was moderately pleased at having built something so complicated that actually worked, but he had no illusions about its being good for anything. He was sort of embarrassed at having wasted so much time and mental energy on the project. But he knew that if he hadn't been writing code, he'd have spent the same amount of time playing games or going to Society for Creative Anachronism meetings in medieval drag, so it all zeroed out in the end. Spending the time in front of the computer was arguably better, because it had honed his programming skills, which had been pretty sharp to begin with. On the other hand, he'd done it all on the UNIX system, which was for scientists and engineers--not a savvy move in an age when all the money was in personal computers. Chester and Randy had nicknamed Avi ``Avid,'' because he really, really liked fantasy games. Avi had always claimed that he played them as a way of understanding what it was really like to live in ancient times, and he was a maniac about historical authenticity. That was okay; they all had half-assed excuses, and Avi's historical acumen frequently came in handy. Not long after this, Avi graduated and disappeared, and popped up a few months later in Minneapolis, where he had gotten a job with a major publisher of fantasy role-playing games. He offered to buy Randy's game software for the astonishingly large sum of $1000 plus a small cut of future profits. Randy accepted the offer in its general outlines, asked Avi to send him a contract, then went out and found Andrew boiling some fish guts in a birchbark kettle atop a Weber grill on the roof of the apartment building where he lived. He wanted to give Andrew the good news, and to cut him in on the proceeds. What ensued was a really unpleasant conversation, standing up there in a pelting, spitting, wind-blown rain. To begin with, Andrew took this deal far more seriously than Randy did. Randy saw it as a windfall, a lark. Andrew, who was the son of a lawyer, treated it as if it were a major corporate merger, and asked many tedious and niggling questions about the contract, which did not exist yet and which would probably cover a single piece of paper when it did. Randy didn't realize it at the time, but by asking so many questions for which Randy had no answers, Andrew was, in effect, arrogating to himself the role of Business Manager. He was implicitly forming a business partnership with Randy that did not, in fact, exist. Furthermore, Andrew didn't have the first notion of how much time and effort Randy had put into writing the code. Or (as Randy was to realize later) maybe he did. In any case, Andrew assumed from the get-go that he would share a fifty-fifty split with Randy, which was wildly out of proportion to the work he'd actually done on the project. Basically, Andrew acted as if all of the work he'd ever done on the subject of aboriginal dining habits was a part of this undertaking, and that it entitled him to an equal split. By the time Randy extricated himself from this conversation, his mind was reeling. He had gone in with one view of reality and been radically challenged by another one that was clearly preposterous; but after an hour of Andrew's browbeating he was beginning to doubt himself. After two or three sleepless nights, he decided to call the whole thing off. A paltry few hundred dollars wasn't worth all of this agony. But Andrew (who was, by now, represented by an associate of his father's Santa Barbara law firm) vehemently objected. He and Randy had, according to his lawyer, jointly created something that had economic value, and a failure on Randy's part to sell it at market value amounted to taking money out of Andrew's pocket. It had become an unbelievable Kafkaesque nightmare, and Randy could only withdraw to a corner table at his favorite pub, drink pints of stout (frequently in the company of Chester) and watch this fantastic psychodrama unfold. He had, he now realized, blundered into some serious domestic weirdness involving Andrew's family. It turned out that Andrew's parents were divorced and, long ago, had fought savagely over custody of him, their only child. Mom had turned into a hippie and joined a religious cult in Oregon and taken Andrew with her. It was rumored that this cult engaged in sexual abuse of children. Dad had hired private dicks to kidnap Andrew back and then showered him with material possessions to demonstrate his superior love. There had followed an interminable legal battle in which Dad had hired some rather fringey psychotherapists to hypnotize Andrew and get him to dredge up repressed memories of unspeakable and improbable horrors. This was just the executive summary of a weird life that Randy only learned about in bits and pieces as the years went on. Later, he was to decide that Andrew's life had been fractally weird. That is, you could take any small piece of it and examine it in detail and it, in and of itself, would turn out to be just as complicated and weird as the whole thing in its entirety. Anyway Randy had blundered into this life and become enveloped in the weirdness. One of the young eager beavers in Andrew's dad's law firm decided, as a preemptive move, to obtain copies of all of Randy's computer files, which were still stored on the UW computer system. Needless to say, he went about it in a heavy-handed way, and when the university's legal department began to receive his sullen letters, it responded by informing both Andrew's lawyer, and Randy, that anyone who used the university's computer system to create a commercial product had to split the proceeds with the university. So now Randy was getting ominous letters from not one but two groups of deadly lawyers. Andrew then threatened to sue him for having made this blunder, which had halved the value of Andrew's share! In the end, just to cut his losses and get out of it clean, Randy had to hire a lawyer of his own. The final cost to him was a hair more than five thousand dollars. The software was never sold to anyone, and indeed could not have been; it was so legally encumbered by that point that it would have been like trying to sell someone a rusty Volkswagen that had been dismantled and its parts hidden in attack dog kennels all over the world. It was the only time in his life when he had ever thought about suicide. He did not think about it very hard, or very seriously, but he did think about it. When it was all over, Avi sent him a handwritten letter saying, ``I enjoyed doing business with you and look forward to continuing our relationship both as friends and, should opportunities arise, as creative partners.'' INDIGO Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the band are up on the deck of the Nevada one morning, playing the national anthem and watching the Stars and Stripes ratchet up the mast, when they are startled to find themselves in the midst of one hundred and ninety airplanes of unfamiliar design. Some of them are down low, traveling horizontally, and others are up high, plunging nearly straight down. The latter are going so fast that they appear to be falling apart; little bits are dropping off of them. It is terrible to see--some training exercise gone miserably awry. But they pull out of their suicidal trajectories in plenty of time. The bits that have fallen off of them plunge smoothly and purposefully, not tumbling and fluttering as chunks of debris would. They are coming down all over the place. Perversely, they all seem to be headed for the berthed ships. It is incredibly dangerous--they might hit someone! Lawrence is outraged. There is a short-lived phenomenon taking place in one of the ships down the line. Lawrence turns to look at it. This is the first real explosion he's ever seen and so it takes him a long time to recognize it as such. He can play the very hardest glockenspiel parts with his eyes closed, and The Star Spangled Banner is much easier to ding than to sing. His scanning eyes fasten, not on the source of the explosion, but on a couple of airplanes that are headed right toward them, skimming just above the water. Each drops a long skinny egg and then their tailplanes visibly move and they angle upwards and pass overhead. The rising sun shines directly through the glass of their canopies. Lawrence is able to look into the eyes of the pilot of one of the planes. He notes that it appears to be some sort of Asian gentleman. This is an incredibly realistic training exercise--even down to the point of using ethnically correct pilots, and detonating fake explosives on the ships. Lawrence heartily approves. Things have just been too lax around this place. A tremendous shock comes up through the deck of the ship, making his feet and legs feel as if he had just jumped off a ten-foot precipice onto solid concrete. But he's just standing there flatfooted. It makes no sense at all. The band have finished playing the national anthem and are looking about at the spectacle. Sirens and horns are speaking up all over the place, from the Nevada, from the Arizona in the next berth, from buildings onshore. Lawrence doesn't see any antiaircraft fire going up, doesn't see any familiar planes in the air. The explosions just keep coming. Lawrence wanders over to the rail and stares across a few yards of open water towards the Arizona. Another one of those plunging airplanes drops a projectile that shoots straight down onto Arizona's deck but then, strangely, vanishes. Lawrence blinks and sees that it has left a neat bomb-shaped hole in the deck, just like a panicky Warner Brothers cartoon character passing at high speed through a planar structure such as a wall or ceiling. Fire jets from that hole for about a microsecond before the whole deck bulges up, disintegrating, and turns into a burgeoning globe of fire and blackness. Waterhouse is vaguely aware of a lot of stuff coming at him really fast. It is so big that he feels more like he is falling into it. He freezes up. It goes by him, over him, and through him. A terrible noise pierces his skull, a chord randomly struck, discordant but not without some kind of deranged harmony. Musical qualities aside, it is so goddamned loud that it almost kills him. He claps his hands over his ears. Still the noise is there, like red-hot knitting needles through the eardrums. Hell's Bells. He spins away from it, but it follows him. He has this big thick strap around his neck, sewn together at groin level where it supports a cup. Thrust into the cup is the central support of his glockenspiel, which stands in front of him like a lyre-shaped breastplate, huge fluffy tassels dangling gaily from the upper corners. Oddly, one of the tassels is burning. That isn't the only thing now wrong with the glockenspiel, but he can't quite make it out because his vision keeps getting obscured by something that must be wiped away every few moments. All he knows is that the glockenspiel has eaten a huge quantum of pure energy and been kicked up to some incredibly high state never before achieved by such an instrument; it is a burning, glowing, shrieking, ringing, radiating monster, a comet, an archangel, a tree of flaming magnesium, strapped to his body, standing on his groin. The energy is transmitted down its humming, buzzing central axis, through the cup, and into his genitals, which would be tumescing in other circumstances. Lawrence spends some time wandering aimlessly around the deck. Eventually he has to help open a hatch for some men, and then he realizes that his hands are still clapped over his ears, and have been for a long time except for when he was wiping stuff out of his eyes. When he takes them off, the ringing has stopped, and he no longer hears airplanes. He was thinking that he wanted to go belowdecks, because the bad things are coming from the sky and he would like to get some big heavy permanent-seeming stuff between him and it, but a lot of sailors are taking the opposite view. He hears that they have been hit by one and maybe two of something that rhymes with ``torpedoes,'' and that they are trying to raise steam. Officers and noncoms, black and red with smoke and blood, keep deputizing him for different, extremely urgent tasks that he doesn't quite understand, not least because he keeps putting his hands over his ears. Probably half an hour goes by before he hits upon the idea of discarding his glockenspiel, which is, after all, just getting in the way. It was issued to him by the Navy with any number of stern warnings about the consequences of misusing it. Lawrence is conscientious about this kind of thing, dating back to when he was first given organ-playing privileges in West Point, Virginia. But at this point, for the first time in his life, as he stands there watching the Arizona burn and sink, he just says to himself: Well, to heck with it! He takes that glockenspiel out of its socket and has one last look at it, it is the last time in his life he will ever touch a glockenspiel. There is no point in saving it now anyway, he realizes; several of the bars have been bent. He flips it around and discovers that chunks of blackened, distorted metal have been impact-welded onto several of the bars. Really throwing caution to the winds now, he flings it overboard in the general direction of the Arizona, a military lyre of burnished steel that sings a thousand men to their resting places on the bottom of the harbor. As it vanishes into a patch of burning oil, the second wave of attacking airplanes arrives. The Navy's antiaircraft guns finally open up and begin to rain shells down into the surrounding community and blow up occupied buildings. He can see human-shaped flames running around in the streets, pursued by people with blankets. The rest of the day is spent, by Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the Navy, grappling with the fact that many two-dimensional structures on this and other ships, which were put into place to prevent various fluids from commingling (e.g. fuel and air) have holes in them, and not only that but a lot of shit is on fire too and things are more than a little smoky. Certain objects that are supposed to (a) remain horizontal and (b) support heavy things have ceased to do either. Nevada's engineering section manages to raise steam in a couple of boilers and the captain tries to get the ship out of the harbor. As soon as she gets underway, she comes under concerted attack, mostly by dive bombers who are eager to sink her in the channel and block the harbor altogether. Eventually, the captain runs her aground rather than see this happen. Unfortunately, what Nevada has in common with most other naval vessels is that she is not really engineered to work from a stationary position, and consequently she is hit three more times by dive bombers. So it is a pretty exciting morning overall. As a member of the band who does not even have his instrument any more, Lawrence's duties are quite poorly defined, and he spends more time than he should watching the airplanes and the explosions. He has gone back to his earlier train of thought regarding societies and their efforts to outdo each other. It is very clear to him, as wave after wave of Nipponese dive bombers hurl themselves, with calligraphic precision, at the ship he is standing on, and as the cream of his society's navy burns and explodes and sinks, putting up virtually no resistance, that his society is going to have to rethink a thing or two. At some point he burns his hand on something. It is his right hand, which is preferable--he is left-handed. Also, he becomes more clearly aware that a portion of Arizona has tried to take his scalp off. These are minor injuries by Pearl Harbor standards and he does not stay long in the hospital. The doctor warns him that the skin on his hand might contract and limit his fingers' range of motion. As soon as he can withstand the pain, Lawrence begins to play Bach's Art of Fugue in his lap whenever he is not otherwise occupied. Most of those tunes start out simple; you can easily picture old Johann Sebastian sitting there on the bench on a cold morning in Leipzig, one or two blockflote stops yanked out, left hand in his lap, a fat choirboy or two over in the corner heaving away on the bellows, faint gasping noises coming from all the leaks in the works, and Johann's right hand wandering aimlessly across the forbidding simplicity of the Great manual, stroking those cracked and yellowed elephant tusks, searching for some melody he hadn't already invented. That is good stuff for Lawrence right now, and so he makes his right hand go through the same motions as Johann's, even though it is a gauze-wrapped hand and he is using an upside-down dinner tray as a substitute for the keyboard, and he has to hum the music under his breath. When he really gets into it, his feet skid around and piston under the sheets, playing imaginary pedals, and his neighbors complain. He is out of the hospital in a few days, just in time for him and the rest of Nevada's band to begin their new, wartime assignment. This was evidently something of a poser for the Navy's manpower experts. These musicians were (from a killing-Nips point of view) completely useless to begin with. As of 7 December, they no longer have even a functioning ship and most of them have lost their clarinets. Still, it isn't all about loading shells and pulling triggers. No large organization can kill Nips in any kind of systematic way without doing a nearly unbelievable amount of typing and filing. It is logical to suppose that men who can play the clarinet will not botch that kind of work any worse than anyone else. And so Waterhouse and his bandmates receive orders assigning them to what would appear to be one of the typing-and-filing branches of the Navy. This is located in a building, not a ship. There are quite a few Navy people who sneer at the whole idea of working in a building, and Lawrence and some of the other recent recruits, eager to fit in, have gotten into the habit of copping the same attitude. But now that they have seen what happens to a ship when you detonate hundreds of pounds of high explosive on, in, and around it, Waterhouse and many others are reassessing their feelings about working in buildings. They report to their new post with high morale. Their new commanding officer is not so cheerful, and his feelings appear to be shared by everyone in the entire section. The musicians are greeted without being welcomed and saluted without being honored. The people who have been working in this building--far from being overawed by their status as guys who not only worked on an actual ship until recently but furthermore have been very close to things that were exploding, burning, etc., and not as the result of routine lapses in judgment but because bad men deliberately made it happen--do not seem to feel that Lawrence and his bandmates deserve to be entrusted with this new work, whatever the hell it is. Glumly, almost despairingly, the commanding officer and his subordinates get the musicians squared away. Even if they don't have enough desks to go around, each man can at least have a chair at a table or counter. Some ingenuity is displayed in finding places for all the new arrivals. It is clear that these people are trying their best at what they considered to be a hopeless task. Then there is some talk about secrecy. A great deal of talk about it. They run through drills intended to test their ability to throw things away properly. This goes on for a long time and the longer it continues, without an explanation as to why, the more mysterious it becomes. The musicians, who were at first a little put out by their chilly reception, start to speculate amongst themselves as to what kind of an operation they have gotten themselves into now. Finally, one morning, the musicians are assembled in a classroom in front of the cleanest chalkboard Waterhouse has ever seen. The last few days have imbued him with just enough paranoia that he suspects it is that clean for a reason--erasing chalkboards is not to be taken lightly during wartime. They are seated in little chairs with desks attached to them, desks designed for right-handers. Lawrence puts his notepad in his lap, then rests his bandaged right hand on the desk and begins to play a ditty from Art of Fugue, grimacing and even grunting with pain as his burned skin stretches and slides over his knuckles. Someone chucks him on the shoulder. He opens his eyes to see that he is the only person in the room sitting down; an officer is on the deck. He stands up and his weak leg nearly buckles. When he finally gets himself fully to his feet, he sees that the officer (if he even is an officer) is out of uniform. Way out of uniform. He's wearing a bathrobe and smoking a pipe. The bathrobe is extraordinarily worn, and not in the sense of, say, a hospital or hotel bathrobe that gets laundered frequently. This thing hasn't been laundered in a long time, but boy has it seen some use. The elbows are worn out and the bottom of the right sleeve is ashy grey and slippery with graphite from being dragged back and forth, tens of thousands of times, across sheets of paper dense with number-two pencil work. The terrycloth has a dandruffy appearance, but it has nothing to do with exfoliation of the scalp; these flakes are way too big, and too geometric: rectangles and circular dots of oaktag, punched out of cards and tape respectively. The pipe went out a long time ago and the officer (or whatever he is) is not even pretending to worry about getting it relit. It is there just to give him something to bite down on, which he does as vigorously as a civil war infantryman having a leg sawed off. Some other fellow--one who actually bothered to shave, shower, and put on a uniform--introduces bathrobe man as Commander Shane-spelled-s-c-h-o-e-n, but Schoen is having none of it; he turns his back on them, exposing the back side of his bathrobe, which around the buttocks is worn transparent as a negligee. Reading from a notebook, he writes out the following in block letters: 19 17 17 19 14 20 23 18 19 8 12 16 19 8 3 21 8 25 18 14 18 6 3 18 8 15 18 22 18 11 Around the time that the fourth or fifth number is going up on the chalkboard, Waterhouse feels the hairs standing up on the back of his neck. By the time the third group of five numbers is written out, he has not failed to notice that none of them is larger than 26--that being the number of letters in the alphabet. His heart is pounding more wildly than it did when Nipponese bombs were tracing parabolic trajectories toward the deck of the grounded Nevada. He pulls a pencil out of his pocket. Finding no paper handy, he writes down the numbers from 1 to 26 on the surface of his little writing desk. By the time the man in the bathrobe is done writing out the last group of numbers, Waterhouse is already well into his frequency count. He wraps it up as Bathrobe Man is saying something along the lines of ``this might look like a meaningless sequence of numbers to you, but to a Nip naval officer it might look like something entirely different.'' Then the man laughs nervously, shakes his head sadly, squares his jaw resolutely, and runs through a litany of other emotion-laden expressions not a single one of which is appropriate here. Waterhouse's frequency count is simply a tally of how frequently each number appears on the blackboard. It looks like this: 1  14 || 2  15 | 3 ||  16 | 4  17 || 5  18 |||||| 6 |  19 |||| 7  20 | 8 ||||  21 | 9  22 | 10  23 | 11 |  24 12 |  25 | 13  26 The most interesting thing about this is that ten of the possible symbols (viz. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 24, and 26) are not even used. Only sixteen different numbers appear in the message. Assuming each of those sixteen represents one and only one letter of the alphabet, this message has (Lawrence reckons in his head) 111136315345735680000 possible meanings. This is a funny number because it begins with four ones and ends with four zeroes; Lawrence snickers, wipes his nose, and gets on with it. The most common number is 18. It probably represents the letter E. If he substitutes E into the message everywhere he sees an 18, then-- Well, to be honest, then he'll have to write out the whole message again, substituting Es for 18s, and it will take a long time, and it might be time wasted because he might have guessed wrong. On the other hand, if he just restrains his mind to construe 18s as Es--an operation that he thinks of as being loosely analogous to changing the presets on a pipe organ's console--then what he sees in his mind's eye when he looks at the blackboard is 19 17 17 19 14 20 23 E 19 8 12 16 19 8 3 21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11 which only has 10103301395066880000 possible meanings. This is a funny number too because of all those ones and zeroes--but it is an absolutely meaningless coincidence. ``The science of making secret codes is called cryptography,'' Commander Schoen says, ``and the science of breaking them is cryptanalysis.'' Then he sighs, grapples visibly with some more widely divergent emotional states, and resignedly plods into the mandatory exercise of breaking these words down into their roots, which are either Latin or Greek (Lawrence isn't paying attention, doesn't care, only glimpses the stark word CRYPTO written in handsized capitals). The opening sequence ``19 17 17 19'' is peculiar. 19, along with 8, is the second most common number in the list. 17 is only half as common. You can't have four vowels or four consonants in a row (unless the words are German) so either 17 is a vowel and 19 a consonant or the other way round. Since 19 appears more frequently (four times) in the message, it is more likely to be the vowel than 17 (which only appears twice). A is the most common vowel after E, so if he assumes that 19 is A, he gets A 17 17 A 14 20 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3 21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11 This narrows it down quite a bit, to a mere 841941782922240000 possible answers. He's already reduced the solution space by a couple of orders of magnitude! Schoen has talked himself up into a disturbingly heavy sweat, now, and is almost bodily flinging himself into a historical overview of the science of CRYPTOLOGY, as the union of cryptography and cryptanalysis is called. There's some talk about an English fellow name of Wilkins, and book called Cryptonomicon that he wrote hundreds of years ago, but (perhaps because he doesn't rate the intelligence of his audience too highly) he goes very easy on the historical background, and jumps directly from Wilkins to Paul Revere's ``one if by land, two if by sea'' code. He even makes a mathematics in-joke about this being one of the earliest practical applications of binary notation. Lawrence dutifully brays and snorts, drawing an appalled look from the saxophonist seated in front of him. Earlier in his talk, the Schoen mentioned that this message was (in what's obviously a fictional scenario ginned up to make this mathematical exercise more interesting to a bunch of musicians who are assumed not to give a shit about math) addressed to a Nip naval officer. Given that context, Lawrence cannot but guess that the first word of the message is ATTACK. This would mean that 17 represented T, 14 C, and 20 K. When he fills these in, he gets A T T A C K 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3 21 T 25 E C E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11 and then the rest is so obvious he doesn't bother to write it out. He cannot restrain himself from jumping to his feet. He's so excited he forgets about the weak legs and topples over across a couple of his neighbors' desks, which makes a lot of noise. ``Do you have a problem, sailor?'' says one of the officers in the corner, one who actually bothered to wear a uniform. ``Sir! The message is, `Attack Pearl Harbor December Seven!' Sir!'' Lawrence shouts, and then sits down. His whole body is quivering with excitement. Adrenalin has taken over his body and mind. He could strangle twenty sumo wrestlers on the spot. Commander Schoen is completely impassive except that he blinks once, very slowly. He turns to one of his subordinates, who is standing against the wall with his hands clasped behind his back, and says, ``Get this one a copy of the Cryptonomicon. And a desk--as close to the coffee machine as possible. And why don't you promote the son of a bitch as long as you're at it.'' The part about the promotion turns out to be either military humor or further evidence of Commander Schoen's mental instability. Other than that small bit of drollery, the story of Waterhouse past this point, for the next ten months, is not much more complicated than the story of a bomb that has just been released from the belly of a plunging airplane. The barriers placed in his path (working his way through the Cryptonomicon, breaking the Nipponese Air Force Meteorological Code, breaking the Coral naval attache machine cipher, breaking Unnamed Nipponese Army Water Transport Code 3A, breaking the Greater East Asia Ministry Code) present about as much resistance as successive decks of a worm-eaten wooden frigate. Within a couple of months he is actually writing new chapters of the Cryptonomicon. People speak of it as though it were a book, but it's not. It is basically a compilation of all of the papers and notes that have drifted up in a particular corner of Commander Schoen's office over the roughly two-year period that he's been situated at Station Hypo, as this place is called.* It is everything that Commander Schoen knows about breaking codes, which amounts to everything that the United States of America knows. At any moment it could have been annihilated if a janitor had stepped into the room for a few minutes and tidied the place up. Understanding this, Commander Schoen's colleagues in the officers' ranks of Station Hypo have devised strenuous measures to prevent any type of tidying or hygienic operations, of any description, in the entire wing of the building that contains Commander Schoen's office. They know enough, in other words, to understand that the Cryptonomicon is terribly important, and they have the wit to take the measures necessary to keep it safe. Some of them actually consult it from time to time, and use its wisdom to break Nipponese messages, or even solve whole cryptosystems. But Waterhouse is the first guy to come along who is good enough to (at first) point out errors in what Schoen has written, and (soon) assemble the contents of the pile into something like an orderly work, and (eventually) add original material onto it. *``Hypo'' is a military way of saying the letter H. Bright boy Waterhouse infers that there must be at least seven others: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc. At some point Schoen takes him downstairs and leads him to the end of a long windowless corridor to a slab of a door guarded by hulking Myrmidons and lets him see the second coolest thing they've got at Pearl Harbor, a roomful of machinery from the Electrical Till Corporation that they use mainly for doing frequency counts on Nip intercepts. The most remarkable machine* at Station Hypo, however--and the first coolest thing in Pearl Harbor--is even deeper in the cloaca of the building. It is contained in something that might be likened to a bank vault if it weren't all wired up with explosives so that its contents can be vaporized in the event of a total Nip invasion. *Assuming, provisionally, that Alan is wrong and that human brains are not machines. This is the machine that Commander Schoen made, more than a year ago, for breaking the Nipponese cipher called Indigo. Apparently, as of the beginning of 1940, Schoen was a well-adjusted and mentally healthy young man into whose lap was dumped some great big long lists of numbers compiled from intercept stations around the Pacific (perhaps, Waterhouse thinks, Alpha, Bravo, etc.). These numbers were Nipponese messages that had been encrypted somehow--circumstantial evidence suggested that it had been done by some kind of machine. But absolutely nothing was known about the machine: whether it used gears or rotary switches or plugboards, or some combination thereof, or some other kind of mechanism that hadn't even been thought of by white people yet; how many such mechanisms it did or didn't use; specific details of how it used them. All that could be said was that these numbers, which seemed completely random, had been transmitted, perhaps even incorrectly. Other than that, Schoen had nothing--nothing--to work on. As of the middle of 1941, then, this machine existed in this vault, here at Station Hypo. It existed because Schoen had built it. The machine perfectly decrypted every Indigo message that the intercept stations picked up, and was, therefore, necessarily an exact functional duplication of the Nipponese Indigo code machine, though neither Schoen nor any other American had ever laid eyes on one. Schoen had built the thing simply by looking at those great big long lists of essentially random numbers, and using some process of induction to figure it out. Somewhere along the line he had become totally debilitated psychologically, and begun to suffer nervous breakdowns at the rate of about one every week or two. As of the actual outbreak of war with Nippon, Schoen is on disability, and taking lots of drugs. Waterhouse spends as much time with Schoen as he is allowed to, because he's pretty sure that whatever happened inside of Schoen's head, between when the lists of apparently random numbers were dumped into his lap and when he finished building his machine, is an example of a noncomputable process. Waterhouse's security clearance is upgraded about once a month, until it reaches the highest conceivable level (or so he thinks) which is Ultra/Magic. Ultra is what the Brits call the intelligence they get from having broken the German Enigma machine. Magic is what the Yanks call the intelligence they get from Indigo. In any case, Lawrence now gets to see the Ultra/Magic summaries, which are bound documents with dramatic, alternating red and black paragraphs printed on the front cover. Paragraph number three states: NO ACTION IS TO BE TAKEN ON INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED, REGARDLESS OF TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE, IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY. Seems clear enough, right? But Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse is not so damn sure. . . . IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING . . . At about the same time, Waterhouse has made a realization about himself. He has found that he works best when he is not horny, which is to say in the day or so following ejaculation. So as a part of his duty to the United States he has begun to spend a lot of time in whorehouses. But he can't have that much actual sex on what is still a glockenspiel player's pay and so he limits himself to what are euphemistically called massages. . . . ACTION. . . EFFECT . . .REVEALING . . . The words stay with him like the clap. He lies on his back during these massages, arms crossed over his eyes, mumbling the words to himself. Something bothers him. He has learned that when something bothers him in this particular way it usually leads to his writing a new paper. But first he has to do a lot of hard mental pick-and-shovel work. It all comes to him, explosively, during the Battle of Midway, while he and his comrades are spending twenty-four hours a day down among those ETC machines, decrypting Yamamoto's messages, telling Nimitz exactly where to find the Nip fleet. What are the chances of Nimitz finding that fleet by accident? That's what Yamamoto must be asking himself. It is all a question (oddly enough!) of information theory. . . .ACTION . . . What is an action? It might be anything. It might be something obvious like bombing a Nipponese military installation. Everyone would agree that this would constitute an action. But it might also be something like changing the course of an aircraft carrier by five degrees--or not doing so. Or having exactly the right package of forces off Midway to hammer the Nipponese invasion fleet. It could mean something much less dramatic, like canceling plans for an action. An action, in a certain sense, might even be the total absence of activity. Any of these might be rational responses, on the part of some commander, to INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED. But any of them might be observable by the Nipponese--and hence any of them would impart information to the Nipponese. How good might those Nips be at abstracting information from a noisy channel? Do they have any Schoens? . . . EFFECT . . . So what if the Nips did observe it? What would the effect be exactly? And under what circumstances might the effect be REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY? If the action is one that could never have happened unless the Americans were breaking Indigo, then it will constitute proof, to the Nipponese, that the Americans have broken it. The existence of the source--the machine that Commander Schoen built--will be revealed. Waterhouse trusts that no Americans will be that stupid. But what if it isn't that clear-cut? What if the action is one that would merely be really improbable unless the Americans were breaking the code? What if the Americans, in the long run, are just too damn lucky? And how closely can you play that game? A pair of loaded dice that comes up sevens every time is detected in a few throws. A pair that comes up sevens only one percent more frequently than a straight pair is harder to detect--you have to throw the dice many more times in order for your opponent to prove anything. If the Nips keep getting ambushed--if they keep finding their own ambushes spoiled--if their merchant ships happen to cross paths with American subs more often than pure probability would suggest--how long until they figure it out? Waterhouse writes papers on the subject, keeps pestering people with them. Then, one day, Waterhouse receives a new set of orders. The orders arrive encrypted into groups of five random-looking letters, printed out on the blue tissue paper that is used for top-secret cablegrams. The message has been encrypted in Washington using a one-time pad, which is a slow and awkward but, in theory, perfectly unbreakable cipher used for the most important messages. Waterhouse knows this because he is one of the only two persons in Pearl Harbor who has clearance to decrypt it. The other one is Commander Schoen, and he is under sedation today. The duty officer opens up the appropriate safe and gives him the one-time pad for the day, which is basically a piece of graph paper covered with numbers printed in groups of five. The numbers have been chosen by secretaries in a basement in Washington by shuffling cards or drawing chits out of a hat. They are pure noise. One copy of the pure noise is in Waterhouse's hands, and the other copy is used by the person who encrypted this message in Washington. Waterhouse sits down and gets to work, subtracting noise from ciphertext to produce plaintext. The first thing he sees is that this message's classification is not merely Top Secret, or even Ultra, but something entirely new: ULTRA MEGA. The messages states that after thoroughly destroying this message, he--Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse--is to proceed to London, England, by the fastest available means. All ships, trains, and airplanes, even submarines, will be made available to him. Though a member of the U.S. Navy, he is even to be provided with an extra uniform--an Army uniform--in case it simplifies matters for him. The one thing he must never, ever do is place himself in a situation where he could be captured by the enemy. In this sense, the war is suddenly over for Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse."

Lijo: ALBERTO NISMAN, Fiscal General, titular de la Unidad Fiscal de Investigación del atentado perpetrado el 18 de julio de 1994 contra la sede de la AMIA [causa 3446/2012, “Velazco, Carlos Alfredo y otros por abuso de autoridad y violación de los deberes de funcionario público, del Juzgado Nacional en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal N° 4, Secretaría N° 8] ante V.S. respetuosamente me presento y digo:  I.- Objeto En cumplimiento del mandato legal impuesto en el artículo 177 inciso Io del Código Procesal Penal de la Nación, como representante del Ministerio Público Fiscal a cargo de la Unidad de Investigación de la causa “AMIA” vengo, por la presente, a denunciar la existencia de un plan delictivo destinado a dotar de impunidad a los imputados de nacionalidad iraní acusados en dicha causa, para que eludan la investigación y se sustraigan de la acción de la justicia argentina, con competencia en el caso. Esta confabulación ha sido orquestada y puesta en funcionamiento por altas autoridades del gobierno nacional argentino, con la colaboración de terceros, en lo que constituye un accionar criminal configurativo, a priori, de los delitos de encubrimiento por favorecimiento personal agravado, impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional e incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionario público (arts. 277 inc. 1 y 3, 241 inc. 2 y 248 del Código Penal). Esto resulta de la mayor gravedad teniendo en cuenta que el hecho cuyo encubrimiento se denuncia, es decir, el atentado terrorista perpetrado contra la sede de la AMIA, ha sido judicialmente declarado crimen de lesa humanidad y calificado como genocidio por el Sr. Juez de la causa. La decisión deliberada de encubrir a los imputados de origen iraní acusados por el atentado terrorista del 18 de julio de 1994, como surge de las evidencias halladas, fue tomada por la cabeza del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional, Dra. Cristina Elisabet Fernández de Kirchner e instrumentada, principalmente, por el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, Sr. Héctor Marcos Timerman. Asimismo, las pruebas examinadas revelan la intervención activa en el plan encubridor de varios sujetos con distintos grados de participación y responsabilidad que la pesquisa deberá precisar, entre los que cabe mencionar a: Luis Angel D’Elía, Femando Luis Esteche, Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, el Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, el Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia y un individuo identificado como “Alian”, que ha desempeñado un rol por demás relevante en los hechos, que responde a la Secretaria de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación y según lo sugieren los indicios obtenidos, se trataría del Sr. Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. Por otra parte, la investigación deberá también determinar el rol exacto que le cupo a ciertos individuos respecto de quienes, prima facie, se cuenta con elementos que permiten colegir que no resultan ajenos a la maniobra delictiva denunciada, entre los cabe mencionar al Ministro de Planificación Federal, Inversión Pública y Servicios de la Nación, Arquitecto Julio De Vido. Por último, corresponde a la pesquisa aquí propiciada la individualización y la determinación de la responsabilidad penal que en los hechos delictivos denunciados pudieron haber tenido todas aquellas personas -funcionarios o no- que intervinieron en la elaboración, negociación, concreción y consumación del acuerdo firmado con la República Islámica de Irán, como una de las vías para lograr la impunidad. Esto incluye tanto a aquellos cuyos roles fueron de público conocimiento, como a quienes eventualmente hayan participado sin que su intervención haya tomado estado público.  Introducción: A lo largo de esta denuncia se expondrán los elementos probatorios que dejan en evidencia la existencia de un sofisticado plan delictivo, deliberadamente ideado para encubrir y dotar de impunidad a los acusados iraníes en la causa seguida por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, con el objeto de que eludan definitivamente a la justicia argentina y se sustraigan de ella. Se verá también que, para la época en que se urdió e instrumentó el plan criminal, la urgencia energética que atravesaba y atraviesa nuestro país y el anhelo por restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal, ligados a una visión geopolítica de acercamiento con la República Islámica de Irán fueron, según las pruebas con que se cuenta, los factores determinantes para que la primera mandataria, Dra. Cristina Elisabet Fernández, con la necesaria e inestimable participación y colaboración de Héctor Timerman, tomara la aciaga decisión de llevar adelante este plan de impunidad, sacrificando la justicia en el caso AMIA. En efecto, quedará acreditado que esta confabulación criminal fue decidida por la Sra. Presidente de la Nación y puesta en funcionamiento, principalmente, por su Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Héctor Marcos Timerman. Asimismo, se probará la activa participación criminal de terceros en la maniobra, entre los que cabe mencionar a Luis Ángel D’Elía; a Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, al Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, a Fernando Esteche, al ex Fiscal designado para actuar en forma conjunta, alterna o sucesiva en la causa AMIA, Héctor Luis Yrimia y a un individuo perteneciente a la Secretaría de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación, identificado como “Alian” que, según las constancias halladas, todo indica que se trataría de Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. En ese sentido, se presentarán las pruebas que ilustran que el plan que aquí se denuncia incluyó negociaciones secretas y públicas con los iraníes, durante las cuales se acordó dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, y que dichas tratativas desembocaron en la firma de un Memorando de Entendimiento que, en su esencia, debe ser considerado como lo que realmente es: apenas uno de los medios elegidos por los aquí acusados para garantizar lo que se había acordado de antemano, esto es, la impunidad de los prófugos iraníes y su desvinculación definitiva de la causa. Como se verá en detalle durante el desarrollo de la denuncia y se adelantará unos párrafos más abajo, la firma y ratificación de tal documento implica lisa y llanamente la destrucción de las imputaciones contra los acusados de nacionalidad iraní. En primer lugar, porque las conclusiones de la llamada “Comisión de la Verdad”, como así lo revela la evidencia, ya se encontraban previamente arregladas entre los signatarios. En segunda medida, como se verificó en los hechos, debido a que el acuerdo fue la excusa que esgrimieron las partes para solicitar a Interpol que diera de baja las notificaciones rojas. En tercer término, porque su confusa y ambigua redacción y las innumerables fases sucesivas previstas, sin plazo alguno, para que sus disposiciones sean aplicadas, permite que los socios en este acuerdo de impunidad aludan indefinidamente a la existencia del Memorando, aunque en la práctica no produzca efecto legal alguno. También, se probará que el plan de impunidad pergeñado por la Sra. Presidente de la Nación incluyó un cambio de hipótesis y un redireccionamiento de la investigación judicial del caso AMIA, hacia “nuevos imputados”, fundado en pruebas falsas y destinado a desvincular definitiva y fraudulentamente a los acusados iraníes. De hecho, algunos de los aquí acusados estuvieron expresamente abocados a fabricar esta hipótesis falsa. Sabían que la “Comisión de la Verdad” no había sido creada para investigar absolutamente nada, sino para legitimar la mentira que se estaba fabricando. Se acreditará que este plan criminal también involucró acuerdos secretos, por fuera del Memorando de Entendimiento. Así, se concertó -en forma oculta- el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que pesaban y pesan sobre los funcionarios iraníes, por ser el interés cardinal de Teherán para suscribir el acuerdo. Asimismo, se probará que secretamente se había pactado que, en la práctica, el ex Ministro de Defensa iraní y actual prófugo de la justicia argentina, Ahmad Vahidi, jamás sería interrogado, a pesar de lo estipulado en el Memorando, pues así había sido convenido entre las partes: “ya había sido conversado antes”. Además, quedará evidenciado que los funcionarios involucrados en este plan criminal, ya sean argentinos o iraníes, han tenido un objetivo común. Que no se trata de dos partes negociando un acuerdo, como se lo quiso presentar públicamente, sino de dos socios buscando borrar -sin que nadie lo advierta- una imputación penal en un delito de lesa humanidad. Más aún, aquí se demostrará que los pasos y avances del plan criminal fueron comunicados en tiempo real no solo a las autoridades iraníes, sino también a uno de los prófugos de la causa AMIA, Mohsen Rabbani, quien participó de negociaciones comerciales con las autoridades argentinas involucradas en este plan e intervino en las tratativas dirigidas - fundamentalmente- a garantizar su propia impunidad. También quedará evidenciado que se lanzó una feroz campaña de descrédito hacia la investigación del caso, destinada a horadar la versión judicial de los hechos, y se la combinó con una campaña de engaño, compuesta por falacias, puestas en escena, mentiras, desmentidas, falsas promesas y la manipulación a sobrevivientes y familiares de las víctimas del atentado, a fin de evitar que la opinión pública conozca la entidad del verdadero objetivo encubridor oculto detrás del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado con Irán. Asimismo, se expondrán los elementos de prueba que acreditan que la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller efectuaron aportes en la necesaria división de tareas que implicó esta compleja maniobra delictiva. De las contribuciones concretas y específicas de la Sra. Presidente que se han podido acreditar con sólido sustento probatorio, surge con claridad que no solamente fue quien decidió la articulación de este plan criminal de impunidad, sino que, para ello, se valió de distintos actores para llevar adelante su ejecución, y en todo momento estuvo en control de la misma, ya sea impartiendo órdenes directas a sus cómplices, o bien encabezando la campaña discursiva y mediática necesaria para camuflar la perpetración del delito. Así, ha elegido a algunos de los partícipes de la maniobra delictiva, involucrando directamente a -cuanto menos- uno de sus ministros y a un legislador nacional; ha controlado la evolución del plan en cada paso; ha negociado por interpósitas personas con uno de los prófugos; y se ha involucrado personalmente en algunas acciones de ocultamiento que este sofisticado plan requería. En la misma línea, se demostrará holgadamente que el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, Héctor Timerman, ha sido - sin duda alguna- el principal instrumentador del plan de impunidad ideado y ordenado por la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fernández. Naturalmente, tratándose de un plan criminal que ha involucrado a un país extranjero, el Canciller ocupaba y ocupa el puesto clave para encargarse personalmente de muchos aspectos de este encubrimiento. Desde su función, transmitió a Irán la decisión del gobierno argentino de abandonar el reclamo de justicia en la causa AMIA; acordó la baja de las notificaciones rojas; signó acuerdos secretos con la parte iraní; participó de las negociaciones, de la redacción y de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, pieza central del plan de impunidad. Y se involucró personalmente en la campaña de descrédito y engaño, destinada a destruir la credibilidad de la causa judicial con el fin de, dolosamente, presentar al acuerdo con Irán como la única vía apta para solucionar el caso. Ambos funcionarios actuaron con un único y delictivo propósito: lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iraníes y el cese de toda actividad jurisdiccional en su contra, en pos de restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal y dar un paso hacia un acercamiento geopolítico con la República Islámica de Irán, sin soportar reproche alguno por parte de la sociedad argentina. Ello, según surge de la evidencia reunida y sin descartar en modo alguno la existencia de otros motivos adicionales a los aquí expuestos, pero que en nada modificarían o disminuirían la criminal responsabilidad de los denunciados. Quizá no resulte ocioso aclarar que nada hay de reprochable en la relación comercial o la vinculación geopolítica entre estados. La objeción surge al comprobarse, nítidamente, que dicho acercamiento implicó por parte de las autoridades del gobierno argentino aquí denunciadas, sacrificar una causa judicial en trámite, desconocer lo decidido por la justicia nacional y urdir un plan criminal para borrar de un plumazo las serias acusaciones que pesan sobre los prófugos iraníes, pretendiendo otorgarles impunidad definitiva. Algo inédito y nunca visto. No se trata de una afirmación dogmática, se aportan en esta denuncia múltiples elementos probatorios que confirman que el anhelo por el petróleo iraní fue uno de los motores de las acciones delictivas denunciadas. A modo de ejemplo puede citarse una mínima parte de la prueba descripta en este escrito, como cuando Femando Esteche, en diciembre de 2012, expresó refiriéndose al gobierno argentino: “...los tipos quieren restablecer relaciones entre los dos estados... o cuando Luis D’Elía, en mayo de 2013, agregó: “...ahí hablé con Julio [en referencia al Ministro Julio De Vido] ...acá hay urgencia energética...ellos están dispuestos a mandar a la gente de YPF a hacer negocios allá [en alusión a Irán '[...está muy interesado en cambiar lo de aquellos por granos y carne...” o, por último, cuando el agente iraní en Buenos Aires, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, confirmó “...el tema que necesita Argentina, es petróleo...hay un verdadero interés para empezar y entablar las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno, con funcionarios del gobierno de acá, una delegación de allá viajaría o a Caracas o al Golfo o a Beirut mejor ...para empezar las relaciones directas de funcionarios a funcionarios... ”. Por si ello no bastara, y aquí lo relevante, otras pruebas vienen a confirmar que el comienzo del intercambio comercial argentino-iraní estaba supeditado a la ratificación de Irán del Memorando de Entendimiento, es decir, al avance del plan de impunidad. Viene al caso destacar lo dicho por Jorge Khalil, uno de los partícipes de dicho plan: “Acá hay luz verde para hacer las operaciones...el tema es que quieren que se apure el memorándum...y se habló con De Vido...Argentina tiene una gran necesidad de petróleo e Irán tiene una gran necesidad de granos... Por otro lado, De Vido entiende que para dar un paso en esto, o sea oficial, de Estado a Estado, tiene que haber firma del Memorándum Y para sorpresa e indignación de muchos, quedará evidenciado por la prueba reunida que en estas negociaciones participó nada menos que uno de los prófugos iraníes, Mohsen Rabbani, quien recibía periódicos reportes telefónicos de los avances que ocurrían en el seno de nuestro gobierno. Para citar otro ejemplo de los tantos que constan en esta presentación, se transcribe uno de los informes telefónicos recibidos por Rabbani: “...hoy terminamos una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas... ”, a lo que Rabbani contestó: “mándeme para que evalúe” y luego de evaluarlo respondió: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina...y también comprar armas... ” Es decir, mientras la justicia nacional acusaba y acusa fundadamente a ciertos funcionarios iraníes de haber decidido, planificado y ejecutado el atentado terrorista contra la sede de la AMIA y mientras públicamente la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller aseguraban que sus acciones estaban exclusivamente motivadas en la búsqueda de justicia para la causa AMIA y que el Memorando de Entendimiento era única solución viable para el caso, uno de esos imputados, Mohsen Rabbani, secreta y clandestinamente negociaba con nuestras autoridades a través de intermediarios y canales ocultos, un intercambio de petróleo por granos, la venta de armamento, y lo que es más grave aún: su impunidad. Acaso resulte una obviedad pero no puede dejar de señalarse que las circunstancias denunciadas revisten una gravedad institucional extrema e inusitada, tanto por la jerarquía funcional de varios de los involucrados en la maniobra criminal como por la calificación legal del delito que se encubre, esto es, el “delito anterior” objeto del encubrimiento, que es, ni más ni menos, que el atentado terrorista a la sede de la AMIA, judicialmente declarado crimen de lesa humanidad y calificado de genocidio por el juez de la causa, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral. Ahora bien, para contextualizar debidamente los hechos delictivos que se denuncian, resulta útil recordar que la justicia argentina determinó que las máximas autoridades iraníes de 1994 fueron quienes tomaron la decisión de atentar contra la AMIA, diagramaron la implementación de ese ataque y encomendaron su ejecución a la organización terrorista libanesa Hezbollah. A consecuencia de ello se solicitó la captura nacional e internacional del ex Presidente de la República Islámica de Irán, Ali Akbar Hashemi Bahramaie Rafsanjani; del ex Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Ali Akbar Velayati; del ex Ministro de Inteligencia, Ali Fallahijan; del ex Jefe de la Guardia Revolucionaria, Mohsen Rezai; del ex Jefe de la Fuerza Al Quds y ex Ministro de Defensa, Ahmad Vahidi; del Ex Agregado Cultural de la Embajada iraní en Argentina, Mohsen Rabbani; del ex Tercer Secretario de la Embajada de Irán en Argentina, Ahmad Reza Asghari y del ex Embajador de la República de Irán en nuestro país, Hadi Soleimpanpour. Desde el año 2007, sobre cinco de tales imputados: Fallahijan, Rezai, Vahidi, Rabbani y Asghari pesan notificaciones rojas, es decir, la máxima prioridad de búsqueda que registra Interpol. Con apoyatura en tales imputaciones, la República Argentina ha venido reclamando por años a la República Islámica de Irán -hasta el momento, infructuosamente- la detención con fines de extradición de los acusados iraníes. En efecto, durante su presidencia, Néstor Kirchner no solo llevó el caso a la Asamblea General de la Organización de Naciones Unidas, sino que rechazó rotundamente todos los ofrecimientos de Teherán, siempre destinados a acordar una salida políticamente negociada a esta cuestión, netamente judicial. Da cuenta esta presentación de voluminosa prueba documental y de varios testimonios coincidentes -del ex Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fernández; de los ex Cancilleres, Rafael Bielsa y Jorge Taiana y del ex Vice Canciller, Roberto García Moritán- que describen los pactos propuestos por Irán y su rechazo de plano por parte del ex presidente argentino. Esa consistencia que durante años tuvo la postura oficial argentina en torno al caso AMIA, sufrió un cambio radical a partir de la decisión de la actual Presidente de avanzar en un plan encubridor que permita a los imputados iraníes eludir y sustraerse definitivamente al accionar de la justicia a efectos de facilitar, entre otros fines, un intercambio comercial a nivel estatal con la República Islámica de Irán. Dando cuenta de ello, el ex canciller Bielsa resaltó el cambio de posición del gobierno de la Dra. Fernández cuando sostuvo: ule dice a los familiares que los que comercian son las empresas y no el Estado. Me parece un argumento pelotudo, me fastidia mucho porque era un tema sagrado para Néstor ....Cuando era canciller, hablar de venderle o comprarle a Irán era casus belli ”. Así las cosas, por mucho tiempo la relación bilateral estuvo signada por la indiferencia iraní a los reclamos argentinos y, como contrapartida, por la sólida resolución de nuestro país de no avanzar en ningún frente vincular sin antes obtener cooperación por parte de Teherán, es decir, la entrega de los acusados para su juzgamiento por la justicia nacional. Se comprobará que, en este contexto histórico y con el cuadro de situación descripto, entre octubre de 2010 y enero de 2011, el gobierno argentino presidido por Cristina Fernández experimentó un giro de 180 grados en relación a su consideración del caso AMIA. Efectivamente, aquel enero de 2011, Héctor Timerman viajó a la ciudad siria de Alepo y secretamente se reunió con su par iraní, Ali Akbar Salehi, a quien le hizo saber que las autoridades políticas argentinas estaban dispuestas a renunciar a la investigación del caso AMIA y a cualquier reclamo de cooperación y justicia, con tal de provocar un acercamiento de orden geopolítico y restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales entre ambos estados. Quedará demostrado también que el Canciller Salehi tomó nota de tal ofrecimiento y se lo comunicó al entonces Presidente Ahmadinejad: “...Argentina ya no está más interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados...en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones comerciales con Irán ”. Es la primera vez que un estado agredido implora a un estado agresor que firme un acuerdo por el cual les otorgará impunidad a los agresores. De este modo, comenzó un período de negociación secreto entre los gobiernos de Argentina e Irán que se extendió hasta septiembre de 2012 y durante el cual, ambas partes realizaron gestos que, a la luz de la prueba recolectada posteriormente y analizados en forma conjunta, claramente han sido indicativos del acuerdo que, en esa época, se estaba incubando. Siempre a modo de ejemplo, dado el carácter introductorio de estos párrafos, puede citarse que el gobierno argentino, en julio de 2011, calificó de “muy positiva” una misiva de la cancillería persa por la cual se ofrecía colaborar con la investigación, curiosamente, en una nueva hipótesis, distinta a la esgrimida por la justicia. Avanzadas dichas negociaciones secretas donde se gestó el encubrimiento y el plan de impunidad de los iraníes, en el mes de septiembre de 2012, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner oficializó las reuniones, siendo que, públicamente ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, adujo que la República Islámica de Irán había expresado su voluntad de negociar por el caso AMIA. Se entienden ahora los motivos por los cuales la Sra. Presidente, en aquella oportunidad y por primera vez, no invitó a las instituciones comunitarias judías a formar parte de su comitiva a la apertura del Debate General de la citada asamblea internacional. El anuncio que haría había sido acordado con anterioridad y con una finalidad distinta a la que se invocó. Quedará aquí probado, que tal manifestación de la Sra. Presidente fue solo una puesta en escena, la primera de muchas que ocurrirían durante el camino que recorrió el plan de impunidad ideado y orquestado por los funcionarios argentinos aquí denunciados. Con este gesto, se buscó ocultar que el acercamiento había sido promovido por Argentina, y no por Irán como se dijo; y se quiso hacer creer que las negociaciones se iniciarían entonces, cuando ya llevaban -al menos- un año y medio. Así, se acreditará que mientras transcurrían las negociaciones diplomáticas públicas, el plan de impunidad avanzaba solapadamente a través de canales paralelos de comunicación y negociación con Irán, gestándose en aquel momento un aspecto fundamental del plan criminal: la desviación de la investigación hacia una nueva y falsa hipótesis que incrimine a terceros inocentes, pero -fundamentalmente- desincrimine a los iraníes, tareas de las participaron activamente Jorge Khalil, Fernando Esteche, Héctor Yrimia y el sujeto conocido como “Alian”. El resultado visible de las negociaciones, tanto secretas como públicas, fue el Memorando de Entendimiento firmado el 27 de enero de 2013 en Etiopía. La versión oficial argentina indicó que se trataba de un instrumento jurídico que permitiría avanzar con las indagatorias de los prófugos. La realidad fue que solo se trató de uno de los medios elegidos por las partes para viabilizar el plan criminal que negociaron durante dos años, pues su letra resultaba y resulta funcional a esta maniobra espuria. Que quede bien claro. El acuerdo entre representantes iraníes y las autoridades argentinas excede con creces la mera letra del memorando. El plan criminal consistió en la eliminación de las imputaciones que la justicia argentina esgrimió contra funcionarios iraníes y el mejor modo que se halló para despejar tales acusaciones, brindar impunidad y presentar el tema de la manera más prolija posible a los ojos de la ciudadanía engañada, fue la suscripción del mencionado acuerdo bilateral. Ello fue así porque su letra prevé mecanismos para lograr la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, porque su aplicación contiene tantas etapas sucesivas sin plazo alguno que permite prolongar indefinidamente su vigencia en el tiempo sin lograr avances reales, porque las conclusiones de la “Comisión de la Verdad” ya estaban arregladas de antemano y su actuación permite la introducción de la nueva hipótesis falsa, armada con pruebas inventadas. En efecto, como se verá, en la práctica, las únicas trabas a la impunidad de hecho de la que gozan los acusados iraníes han sido las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, que tienen la capacidad de dificultar su movilidad trasnacional. Por ello, las partes acordaron hacerlas cesar. De allí que el punto 7 del Memorando tenga su razón de ser. Trátase del único punto que debía tener aplicación inmediata, del único que tiene carácter operativo sin necesidad de que el acuerdo haya sido ratificado. Redactado en esos términos, carece de toda explicación lógica. Se advierte, entonces, que la baja de las notificaciones rojas fue el primer y trascendental paso acordado secretamente entre Salehi y Timerman hacia la desvinculación definitiva de los imputados. Nótese que, al mes de haberse firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, el agente de inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación “Alian” le comunicó al operador iraní Khalil, “Tengo un chisme...me dijeron ahí en 'la casa' [en referencia a la Secretaría de Inteligencia]...Interpol va a levantar el pedido de capturas de los amigos [en alusión a los prófugos iraníes]...lo va a levantar ahora”. En forma sorpresiva e inesperada para los encubridores, Interpol advirtió que se lo quiso involucrar donde nada tenía que hacer e intercedió a tiempo para evitar la baja de las prioridades de búsqueda. Se verá cómo esa intervención se erigió en un obstáculo inesperado para los autores del encubrimiento. Timerman no pudo cumplir lo que había prometido en sus negociaciones secretas con Irán, circunstancia que motivó la queja de los iraníes. Repárese, además, que desde que Interpol comunicó que las notificaciones rojas contra los acusados por el caso AMIA seguirían vigentes, la República Islámica de Irán retiró el acuerdo de su agenda parlamentaria y hasta el momento en que se formula esta presentación, no ha comunicado oficialmente su aprobación interna. El motivo de semejante vuelta atrás surge nítido de las pruebas que se presentarán. El agente persa Khalil, al día siguiente de regresar de Irán, comunicó a las autoridades argentinas la razón de la tardanza, ante el reclamo local por la demora de Teherán en la aprobación interna de Memorando de Entendimiento: “...De Vido tiene que saber que Timerman no cumplió con algunas cosas. Esto es así de claro. No cumplió con algunas cosas...” y en otra oportunidad, expresó: “...meparece que el ruso este de mierda [en alusión a Héctor Timerman] se mandó alguna...estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares [en referencia a las notificaciones rojas]... ”. Más allá de los ejemplos relatados, lo que se pretende dejar aquí en blanco sobre negro son dos conclusiones reveladoras que se desprenden de estos dichos, como de otras probanzas que también se analizarán. La primera radica en la certidumbre sobre la existencia de una promesa por parte del canciller Timerman para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas. Timerman no cumplió, no porque no haya querido, sino porque Interpol se lo impidió. Incluso, podrá apreciarse en esta denuncia que el Canciller volvió a la carga en los meses de septiembre y noviembre de 2013, con claras intenciones de convencer a Ronald Noble para que ceda y autorice el cese de las notificaciones rojas, bajo el argumento que el acuerdo entre las partes siguió avanzando, pero -por fortuna- tampoco entonces pudo lograr su cometido. La segunda conclusión que se desprende de aquella conversación transmite la certeza de que, además del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado, han existido entre las partes otros acuerdos secretos. Corrobora tal afirmación, entre otras evidencias, el testimonio del propio Salehi, quien reconoció sin ambages: “Interpol debe eliminar las acusaciones contra las autoridades iraníes ....El [contenido] del acuerdo entre Irán y Argentina en relación con la cuestión AMIA será hecho público en el momento adecuado y la cuestión [de los imputados iraníes] está incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo...”. Habiendo sido realizada esta declaración en el mes de marzo de 2013, resulta evidente que Salehi no se estaba refiriendo al Memorando de Entendimiento sino a otro convenio que a esa fecha aún no se había dado a conocer. Y en este marco deben entenderse también las manifestaciones de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, cuando comentando noticias periodísticas que difundían que el ex Ministro de Defensa iraní, Ahmad Vahidi, nunca sería interrogado pese a estar incluido en el Memorando, aseguró que el rumor era cierto, que ese tema en particular “estaba conversado antes....estaba dentro del marco ” y que el acuerdo era “más profundo todavía ”. Es decir, quedará probado que el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, Héctor Timerman no solo firmó un Memorando de Entendimiento abiertamente inconstitucional, que además garantiza la impunidad de los acusados iraníes, sino que también cerró acuerdos secretos mucho más beneficiosos para los prófugos. De allí que se compruebe que no se trató, como se presentó públicamente, de dos partes que negociaron un acuerdo bilateral, sino que fueron dos socios que confeccionaron un sofisticado plan criminal de impunidad para desligar definitivamente a los prófugos de la causa AMIA de toda relación con el atentado y cerrar toda investigación respecto de ellos. De hecho, luego de suscribirse el acuerdo, el agente argentino “Alian” le confesó a su par de Irán: “...Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me tenías fe...”, dejando en evidencia que ambas partes han tenido el mismo objetivo criminal. Ahora bien, surge de la evidencia detallada en la denuncia, que la oportuna intervención de Interpol manteniendo vigentes las notificaciones rojas no frustró ni imposibilitó a futuro el encubrimiento orquestado. Los autores habían tenido la precaución de idear mecanismos alternativos para conseguir sus fines, contenidos en la letra del Memorando de Entendimiento. Se advertirá sobre los numerosísimos mecanismos previstos en el intrincado acuerdo bilateral. Naturalmente ello no ha sido fruto de la incompetencia de los redactores sino, todo lo contrario, de su sagacidad para dotar al Memorando de un enmarañado proceso de aplicación que exige, para que un imputado iraní se siente a escuchar los cargos de la justicia argentina, la verificación de una larguísima serie de procedimientos, alguno de ellos de imposible cumplimiento, atento a la incompatibilidad con sus respectivas legislaciones:	1) que ambos países ratifiquen internamente los términos del acuerdo; 2) que se remitan mutuamente las notas reversales notificando dicha ratificación; 3) que cada uno de los signatarios proceda a la elección de personas de reconocida trayectoria jurídica y probidad personal para que integren la “Comisión de la Verdad”; 4) que los elegidos acepten la designación; 5) que entre ambas partes y de común acuerdo, seleccionen un quinto miembro de la comisión; 6) que los miembros de la Comisión redacten las reglas del procedimiento al que se sujetarán; 7) que se pida información de la causa; 8) que se envíe la información requerida y se la traduzca; 9) que cada uno de los miembros de la comisión analice las pruebas remitidas; 10) que se reúnan para emitir recomendaciones; 11) que se notifiquen dichas recomendaciones a los signatarios; 12) que se establezca una fecha para cumplir con audiencias; 13) que se cite a los imputados; 14) que éstos efectivamente comparezcan a un interrogatorio, que no reúne -como se verá- las condiciones mínimas para ser considerado una declaración indagatoria válida para el derecho argentino. Ninguno de estos pasos tiene plazo determinado para ser cumplido. Tan es así, que ha pasado más de un año y medio desde la firma del Memorando y todavía no se concluyó siquiera el primer escalón. Irán aún no ha comunicado la ratificación del acuerdo. Puede verse con claridad que los términos de este pacto, reflejo de una actividad criminal subyacente, están redactados de modo tal que muy sencillamente se puede demorar en forma indefinda su cumplimiento. Otra llave que conduce a la impunidad definitiva es la efectiva actuación de la “Comisión de la Verdad” cuya finalidad consiste en - llegado el momento- recibir y valorar nuevas pruebas y presentar una nueva hipótesis sin iraníes como acusados, legitimando el redireccionamiento de la pesquisa. La comisión evaluará una nueva verdad falsa, una verdad armada artificialmente por los inescrupulosos artífices de este siniestro plan. Nuevamente, prueba directa sostiene lo afirmado. El agente iraní Jorge Khalil, el mismo día de la firma del Memorando, expresó: “...alguien va a salir con la cara manchada de acá...” y ciertamente estaba seguro que no sería el país al que sirve porque “...Obvio, eso ya está arreglado... ¿Cómo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo? Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa... ”. En ese sentido se demostrará, con pruebas categóricas, que una vez firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento comenzó una relación de apoyo y protección del gobierno argentino a los referentes iraníes apostados en Buenos Aires que, conscientes de ello, afirmaron “el gobierno ahora está a favor""\ “...el gobierno banca...” y el propio Khalil reconoció: “...Nosotros estamos ante un acuerdo con el gobierno nacional ...atrás de una negociación con el gobierno nacional...”. En otro pasaje de la denuncia quedará demostrado que autores y cómplices, como parte integral del plan criminal, ya habían planificado y avanzado en la fabricación de una hipótesis acusatoria falsa, con pruebas inventadas para redireccionar la pesquisa hacia terceros inocentes y así desligar definitivamente a los nacionales iraníes. En referencia a dicha desincriminación fraudulenta, en una fecha tan temprana como diciembre de 2012, Esteche aseveró: “quieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla... Y de la conversación se desprende que esa tarea quedó a cargo de funcionarios de la Secretaría de Inteligencia, especialmente designados para ello. Es decir, en una época en que ni la justicia ni los familiares sabían qué estaba ocurriendo con la negociación entre Argentina e Irán, los partícipes del encubrimiento conocían perfectamente que se venía un cambio de hipótesis y el redireccionamiento de la investigación hacia nuevos imputados. Esto era así, pues ellos mismos eran justamente los encargados de armar la falsa acusación. Así se explican las palabras de “Alian” cuando afirmó “...estamos en otro país, es otra situación mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...''’' y “...va a venir otra hipótesis con otras pruebas...” que iban a descolocar al suscripto como Fiscal de la causa “porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas ...lo que viene ahora Sin importar las evidencias, los hechos o su verdadera responsabilidad en el atentado, los ciudadanos iraníes iban a ser desvinculados de la causa, se le iba a “lavar la cara” a Irán y ello estaba cerrado “muy arriba”, es decir tenía el sello presidencial. Todo había sido acordado, se iba a utilizar el caso AMIA como una pieza para saciar intereses geopolíticos en el nuevo tablero internacional. Casi con ironía, al suscribir el acuerdo, el canciller emitió un comunicado que rezaba: “...El gobierno nacional ratifica que el único compromiso es con las víctimas y el derecho de sus familiares a hallar en la verdad y en la justicia la reparación debida. Argentina reafirma que en dicho objetivo no hay lugar para intereses geopolíticos, ni propios, ni ajenos... ”. Las pruebas aquí obtenidas revelan que esto no era cierto y que intereses comerciales y geopolíticos motorizaron un plan secreto de impunidad, que nada tiene que ver con la búsqueda de justicia. Por otra parte, resulta oportuno destacar también la tranquilidad con que actuaron todos los partícipes del plan de impunidad, en particular el individuo conocido como “Alian”, que se ha venido desenvolviendo libremente sin considerar necesario actuar de modo encubierto, ni siquiera ante la extrema sensibilidad del asunto que llevaba adelante. Ello se ha debido simplemente a la circunstancia de que ha actuado por órdenes superiores, por directivas expresas de la Presidente de la Nación, razón por la cual no ha tenido que preocuparse por camuflar sus actividades. “Alian”, en primera persona, confesó esa máxima garantía. La redirección de la investigación y el desprestigio de las autoridades judiciales a cargo de la investigación tenían el sello presidencial “tranquilo, está cerrado muy arriba Además, conforme podrá apreciarse con mayor claridad en el desarrollo de las páginas correspondientes, se verá que tanto la Sra. Presidente como su Canciller contribuyeron en forma personal al perfeccionamiento del plan criminal. Ambos se involucraron en una campaña política y mediática pretendiendo instalar, entre otras falsas cuestiones, la idea de que la causa por el atentado a la AMIA estaba paralizada prácticamente desde que se inició. Quedará expuesto con sumo detalle el modo en que la Dra. Fernández y el Sr. Timerman han manipulado a sobrevivientes, a familiares de las víctimas del atentado y a instituciones judías comunitarias, desplegando una completa artillería de mentiras, falacias y engaños que tienen su ejemplo emblemático en la promesa presidencial, flagrantemente incumplida, que aseguró una consulta con familiares y víctimas, previo a la aceptación de cualquier propuesta por parte de Irán. Recuérdese que, en septiembre de 2012, la primera mandataria expresó: “...tengan la certeza de que esta Presidenta no va a tomar ninguna resolución respecto de ninguna propuesta que le sea formulada, sin consultar PREVIAMENTE con quienes han sido las víctimas directas de esto. Y, al mismo tiempo también, con las fuerzas políticas con representación parlamentaria en mi país, porque esto no puede decidir una sola fuerza política.. La realidad fue cruda. Se engañó a los familiares y a las víctimas del atentado ya que, contrario a lo prometido, jamás se los consultó. Es más, debieron enterarse de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento con la República Islámica de Irán por los medios de comunicación. Tampoco fueron escuchados cuando expresaron mayoritariamente su rechazo a la ratificación del acuerdo por parte del Congreso Nacional. Quedó claro, entonces, que dijeran lo que dijeran los familiares la decisión estaba tomada. El Memorando había sido firmado para garantizar un objetivo oculto: dotar de impunidad a los acusados iraníes y permitir al gobierno argentino justificar ante sus ciudadanos y la comunidad internacional el restablecimiento de las relaciones comerciales y el alineamiento con Teherán. Por ello, el acuerdo debía ser aprobado a cualquier costo, porque despejaba el único escollo que existía para asociarse con Irán. Era estrictamente necesario para la consecución del plan criminal pergeñado. Vaya ironía. Una Presidente que públicamente se ha regodeado manifestando a los sobrevivientes y a los familiares de las víctimas su compromiso en la búsqueda de verdad y justicia, que ha declarado que su gobierno no permitirá que se use el caso AMIA en el ajedrez de la geopolítica mundial, que ha tomado cartas en el asunto porque la causa estaba paralizada; fue, en realidad, la principal artífice, junto con el Canciller Timerman, de la fraudulenta desarticulación de la investigación y del encubrimiento de estos acusados. En el discurso se habló de justicia y verdad. En los hechos se acordó impunidad. Pasmoso. Da pavor, entonces, constatar que todo se ha tratado de actuación y manipulación de hechos y personas y, más aún, de acciones delictivas. También se acreditará que la reunión del 28 de septiembre de 2012	entre los cancilleres de ambos países, fue una puesta en escena previamente pautada y, en realidad, gestada a pedido de Cristina Fernández para engañar a la opinión pública argentina. Mientras días atrás, la Presidente había exhortado con firmeza, ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, al flamante presidente iraní Hassan Rohani para que avance con la implementación del pacto; por lo bajo y a través de los canales paralelos de negociación que se desarrollaron para llevar adelante este plan criminal, la Dra. Cristina Fernández entabló comunicaciones con altos mandos iraníes y con el mismo Mohsen Rabbani. El mensajero argentino Luis D’Elía especificó el pedido: “...tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar allá urgente [en referencia a Irán], antes de mañana...Estoy en la casa de gobierno ahora...no hay asunto más importante que este, créemelo ....necesito que hables con el Sheik de allá [en referencia a Rabbani] mira que es muy groso lo que tengo eh!..”. La Sra. Presidente buscaba obtener ciertos pronunciamientos públicos por parte de Teherán, aunque fueran falsos porque serían funcionales al plan de impunidad, siempre con el objeto de avanzar en su objetivo último: el acercamiento comercial y geopolítico con Irán. El receptor del mensaje de D’Elía y transmisor a Irán, Jorge Khalil, reveló la información al expresar: “...Necesitan que el gobierno iraní junto con el gobierno argentino mañana anuncie la conformación de la Comisión de la Verdad...”. Así se adelanta lo que quedará demostrado en este punto: el interés imperioso de los encubridores en realizar nuevos aportes al plan, la existencia de canales de comunicación y negociación paralelos a los oficiales y ocultos a la opinión pública, la evidencia flagrante de que los detalles sobre el plan criminal se arreglaron en secreto por tales canales y que las manifestaciones públicas de la Presidente y el Canciller han sido solo maquillaje mediático para engañar a la ciudadanía respecto a la real situación del caso AMIA. Finalmente, quedará demostrado que este sofisticado plan, como se expuso al inicio, fue ejecutado por un conjunto de cómplices. En primer lugar, corresponde mencionar a Luis D’Elía, desde siempre un acérrimo defensor tanto del régimen iraní como del gobierno nacional, al punto de calificarse a sí mismo como “un soldado” incondicional de la Presidente: “ ...Yo tengo que hacer el juego de la Rosada...Si tengo orden de no ir, soy un soldado acá...”. Funcionó como el interlocutor oculto de las autoridades gubernamentales argentinas y operó como transmisor y receptor de los mensajes clandestinos a la contraparte iraní, destinado a remover los obstáculos que iba presentando el avance del encubrimiento. Su voz ha sido la del gobierno nacional. Sus antecedentes lo avalaban para ocupar esa función. Consustanciado ideológicamente con ambas partes del pacto delictivo, estuvo varias veces en Irán invitado por el régimen y en una ocasión, le ofrecieron un acuerdo similar al que luego firmó Timerman, que ya incluía el cese de las notificaciones rojas. En todas sus visitas a Irán, se entrevistó con las máximas autoridades, se fotografió -entre otros- con el prófugo Mohsen Rabbani, con quien está relacionado hace años. Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil es el referente más importante de las autoridades del régimen iraní en Argentina, incluso por encima del ex Encargado de Negocios de Irán en nuestro país, sobre quien -como luego se verá- tenía más poder. Militante a tiempo completo de los intereses persas, es la “voz y oídos de Irán” en Argentina. En ese carácter, ha funcionado como el nexo central en la vinculación entre funcionarios iraníes y argentinos en el marco de los hechos denunciados, operando -de ese modo- como el referente de la diplomacia paralela que comunica Buenos Aires con Teherán, que fue aprovechada para la consecución del plan de impunidad. Participó tanto del armado de la pista falsa, como de las tratativas con el gobierno argentino relativas a los intercambios comerciales que se pretendían establecer con Irán a nivel estatal. Y mantuvo constantemente informado de cada avance del plan al prófugo Mohsen Rabbani. Femando Esteche, es el líder de la agrupación Quebracho, muy cercano a algunos funcionarios del gobierno nacional y que desde antaño ha mantenido una postura favorable a los intereses iraníes, tanto que ha sido sostenido económicamente por dicho régimen. Su intervención ha sido determinante pues se trata de uno de los sujetos que viabilizó el avance del plan de encubrimiento, acercando al agente iraní Khalil a los funcionarios de inteligencia argentinos, y en especial, al ex Fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA, Héctor Yrimia, además de haber aportado ideas concretas para la construcción de la nueva hipótesis falsa. El Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque también ha sido un actor clave en la articulación del plan criminal pues, dada su cercanía tanto con la Presidente de la Nación como con los partícipes del encubrimiento ha operado como nexo e intermediario de la información transmitida entre autores y cómplices del encubrimiento. Se probarán distintos episodios en los que Larroque bajó directivas presidenciales, tanto a Khalil como a D'Elía, sobre cómo debían actuar. Como por ejemplo, la ocasión en que, en noviembre de 2012, Khalil reconoció: “...vengo de La Matanza recién he tenido una reunión con Luis D'Elía y el “Cuervo” Larroque, el de la Cámpora...que me llamaron temprano que querían hablar conmigo, que tenían un mensaje para el gobierno para dar... Y ahora me voy para Martínez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador...”. Su intervención ha resultado indispensable en la ingeniería criminal para evitar el contacto directo entre autores y ejecutores del plan de impunidad. El Dr. Héctor Yrimia, entonces Fiscal de Primera Instancia en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal, fue designado el día del atentado junto a otros fiscales para actuar en forma conjunta, alterna o sucesiva en el caso AMIA. De allí que haya conocido en detalle los hechos materia de investigación. En consecuencia, estuvo en contacto con pruebas, testimonios, peritajes e informes de la causa y -justamente- este minucioso grado de cognición lo ha tornado fundamental para el buen desarrollo del plan. Su aporte fue realizado donde resultó más útil: en el armado de una hipótesis falsa donde, valiéndose de la información obtenida en ejercicio de la función pública, ha cooperado con dicha fase del plan. Una mención aparte merece el sujeto conocido como “Alian”, que responde a la Secretaría de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación. Se trata de una persona con acceso al entorno presidencial, que cuenta con información privilegiada -incluso sobre la salud de la Sra. Presidente- y que ha declarado su simpatía con el régimen iraní, que ha actuado -en reiteradas ocasiones- a favor de intereses extranjeros en detrimento de los nacionales. Que ha transmitido informaciones secretas y protegidas por la ley de inteligencia a agentes de una potencia extranjera y en quien la Sra. Presidente ha confiado para llevar adelante parte del plan de impunidad por su dedicación, obediencia, pero -sobre todo- por su falta de escrúpulos a la hora de manipular pruebas y personas para la consecución del designio ilegal que le fuera encomendado por su jefa. Efectivamente, quedará ampliamente explicado y comprobado, que los partícipes del encubrimiento, en especial el nombrado “Alian”, junto al ex Fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA y ex Juez de Instrucción, Dr. Héctor Yrimia, han trabajado y negociado la impunidad de los prófugos de la causa AMIA, transmitiendo para ello información sensible y clasificada a la contraparte iraní, contribuyendo al armado de una pista falsa, con pruebas inventadas, conspirando contra la investigación judicial e incluso utilizando los resortes del Estado Nacional para allanar cualquier obstáculo que surgiera durante la ejecución del plan de encubrimiento. En fin, los hechos que aquí se relataron, en brevísima síntesis, constituyen la concreción de un sofisticado plan de encubrimiento para dotar de impunidad a los acusados iraníes por la causa AMIA, que fue decidido por la Sra. Presidente Cristina Fernández, e instrumentado - principalmente- por su canciller Héctor Timerman, con la colaboración de personajes que, por sus cualidades y conocimientos, resultaron ideales para llevar a cabo la maniobra criminal. La paradójica y por cierto irritante circunstancia de este entramado delictivo fue que los autores del plan, para lograr sus objetivos criminales, al mismo tiempo que clamaban públicamente que solo buscaban verdad y justicia, no trepidaron en buscar destruir la imputación de la justicia argentina a expensas de 85 muertes.  I.	- Aclaración previa sobre la prueba: Los elementos probatorios que sirven de sustento para radicar la presente denuncia son, algunos de ellos, de acceso público. Sin embargo, otros, han llegado a conocimiento del suscripto en el ejercicio de su función y en el marco de la investigación del atentado perpetrado contra la sede de la AMIA. Se tratan, estos últimos, del producto de intervenciones telefónicas dispuestas judicialmente en la causa AMIA, con anterioridad incluso al comienzo de las negociaciones espurias. Inicialmente, siempre en el marco de la pesquisa por el atentado, pruebas, indicios y circunstancias fueron hallados o conocidos en forma aislada, independientes unos de otros, de forma tal que nada revelaban respecto del sustrato delictivo que, hoy ya se advierte, tienen en común. Sin embargo, el paso del tiempo y -fundamentalmente- la aparición de nuevos elementos, insoslayables por la criminalidad que exponen, hicieron que cobrara forma y solidez la sospecha sobre la existencia del plan delictivo aquí acreditado, toda vez que las evidencias obtenidas, observadas integralmente, permiten revelar una gravísima actividad delictiva. Las graves irregularidades y delitos que fueron surgiendo de las intervenciones telefónicas analizadas se tornaron cada vez más evidentes. Quedó claro que las conversaciones mantenidas por los imputados tenían su correspondiente correlato en la realidad. Los partícipes anticipaban lo que iba ocurriendo. Así comenzó a develarse el entramado criminal que aquí se denuncia y muchas de las dudas que surgían de la actuación del gobierno argentino, por ejemplo, los términos en que había sido redactado y firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, encontraron su explicación en el producido de las escuchas judiciales. Tal como un rompecabezas que va adquiriendo forma al colocarle nuevas piezas, el plan de encubrimiento fue hallando su foco, las fases del “iter criminis” fueron tornándose más nítidas y fue posible desentrañar, al menos, una parte de esta sofisticada maniobra. No debe caerse en la simplificación o la ingenuidad de que esta presentación abarca todos los elementos del plan criminal de impunidad. En rigor de verdad, lo que se vislumbra, por grave que sea, resulta ser -apenas- la punta del iceberg. Al respecto, se advierte que los aspectos más delicados de la planificación del delito no fueron comentados vía telefónica sino convenidos personalmente, por lo que la rápida actividad jurisdiccional para reconstruir históricamente lo sucedido, resulta, en este caso, fundamental. En consecuencia, corresponde afirmar que lo denunciado, ya de una gravedad institucional inusitada, es tan solo una pequeña parte de la trama y de las conductas ilícitas llevadas adelante. Será el Magistrado instructor quien deberá determinar hasta dónde se extiende en su real dimensión este plan de encubrimiento e impunidad. Por otra parte, cabe destacar que circunstancias y referencias que surgen de las comunicaciones registradas han podido ser corroboradas, ya sea porque tomaron estado público o bien, porque se condicen con hechos o manifestaciones posteriores que también han trascendido al conocimiento de todos. En otras palabras, referencias, circunstancias, fechas, episodios, posicionamientos políticos, es decir, un conjunto heterogéneo de cuestiones mencionadas en los intercambios telefónicos que aquí se reproducen, han tenido correlato en la realidad y ello redunda en la verosimilitud de las conversaciones registradas.

Estos son solo algunos pocos ejemplos de las abundantes y variadas referencias que surgen de las escuchas judiciales, que se condicen con hechos de la realidad. Dicho de otro modo, existe una correlación entre la realidad y las cuestiones que se mencionan en estos intercambios, lo que fortalece la calidad probatoria de este material y le otorga la necesaria contundencia, dado el tenor de la maniobra que se denuncia. En consecuencia, y	en virtud de la	inusitada importancia de los hechos	denunciados y sin	perjuicio de	posteriores presentaciones ampliatorias, corresponde no solo radicar la presente denuncia sino requerir una inmediata y urgente investigación de hechos que, como el presente, poseen una gravedad institucional poca veces vista.  II.	- Antecedentes a)	La acusación judicial a funcionarios iraníes en la causa AMIA El 18 de julio de	1994, aproximadamente a las 9.53 de la mañana,	una camioneta Renault	Trafic cargada	con una cantidad estimada - en su equivalente en T.N.T.- entre 300 y 400 kgs. de un compuesto de nitrato de amonio, aluminio, un hidrocarburo pesado, T.N.T. y nitroglicerina, explotó frente al edificio de la calle Pasteur 633, donde tenían su sede, entre otras instituciones, la Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) y la Delegación de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentinas (DAIA). El hecho provocó la muerte de ochenta y cinco personas, lesiones de distinta gravedad en al menos ciento cincuenta y una, y cuantiosos daños materiales. Sin perjuicio de lo ocurrido en los primeros años de la pesquisa, con fecha 25 de octubre de 2006, el suscripto emitió un dictamen en el que se acusó a un ciudadano libanés y a siete ciudadanos iraníes, - todos ellos, altos funcionarios del entonces gobierno persa-, por su participación en el atentado del 18 de julio de 1994 (fs. 122.333/122.738 de los autos principales ). El 9 de noviembre de 2006, el Sr. Juez de la causa, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, dispuso librar órdenes de captura nacional e internacional para dar con nueve imputados (un libanés y ocho iraníes)“, con miras a su extradición y a fin de recibirles declaración indagatoria en la causa (fs. 122.775/122.800). Consecuentemente, INTERPOL Buenos Aires confeccionó y remitió a sus similares las correspondientes notificaciones rojas. Por su parte, la justicia argentina, al comprobar que los sujetos buscados no habían comparecido, el Io de diciembre de 2006, los declaró rebeldes. Las órdenes de captura dictadas por el juez Canicoba Corral a instancias de esta Fiscalía, fueron cuestionadas por la Oficina Central Nacional Teherán (OCN Teherán). La Secretaría General de INTERPOL invitó a las partes a una reunión programada para el mes de enero de 2007. El 22 de aquel mes la delegación argentina, encabezada por el suscripto, realizó una presentación ante dicha Secretaría General en la cual expuso pormenorizada y detalladamente las razones y argumentos que justificaban una nueva inscripción de las notificaciones rojas relativas a las órdenes de captura internacional dispuestas en la causa. Puntualmente se explicó que los nuevos pedidos de captura estaban fundados en una decisión judicial de un estado soberano, basados en nuevas probanzas y que respetaban los requisitos fijados por INTERPOL para la inscripción de medidas de tal naturaleza, exhortando a las autoridades de la organización a que, en forma inmediata, dispusieran la búsqueda y detención de quienes se encontraban sospechados de haber tenido participación en el mayor atentado terrorista en la historia de nuestro país. La Secretaría General de INTERPOL, tras escuchar también los argumentos de la delegación iraní, dispuso que el asunto fuera tratado por el Comité Ejecutivo del organismo a la vez que encomendó a la Oficina de Asuntos Legales la confección de un dictamen sobre la cuestión debatida. Dicha oficina efectuó una saludable distinción entre las solicitudes de detención de ciudadanos iraníes formuladas por el ex juez Galeano (a las que denominó AMIA I) y las órdenes de capturas libradas en noviembre de 2006 por el Dr. Canicoba Corral (a las que llamó AMIA II) recomendando que, sobre cinco de las ocho personas acusadas, se acceda a la solicitud de publicar las notificaciones rojas. La situación de quienes, al momento del hecho, desempeñaban los cargos de Presidente y Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de la República Islámica de Irán, fue considerada similar a la analizada por el Tribunal Internacional de Justicia en el caso: “República Democrática del Congo vs. Bélgica” y las notificaciones rojas quedaron excluidas. Tampoco se emitió notificación roja respecto del exembajador iraní en Argentina, Hadi Soleimanpour. Además, sobre la presentación que formuló el suscripto en la sede de INTERPOL, su Secretario General, Sr. Ronald Noble, sostuvo: “...la altamente profesional explicación de su caso, acusado por acusado, proporcionada por los fiscales argentinos que intervienen en la causa fue importante en la conclusión de la Oficina de Asuntos Jurídicos de que el caso del pedido de ¡as notificaciones rojas por parte de la OCN Buenos Aires no revestía un carácter político predominante como para que entrara en vigor la prohibición del artículo 3.. ” En el mes de marzo de 2007 tuvo lugar la reunión del Comité Ejecutivo del INTERPOL que debía decidir esta materia (Sudáfrica, Chile, Singapur, Italia, Argelia, Estados Unidos, Corea, España, Marruecos, Brasil, India, Rusia y Alemania). Nuevamente una delegación argentina viajó a la ciudad de Lyon, República de Francia. El día 14 de ese mes, quien firma ésta presentación expuso su postura ante los miembros del Comité Ejecutivo reunidos a tal efecto en la sede central de INTERPOL. Finalizado el alegato, algunos miembros formularon consultas relativas al caso, que fueron respondidas. Seguidamente la delegación iraní hizo lo propio. Finalmente, ambas delegaciones fueron convocadas a la sala de sesiones donde el señor Presidente del Comité Ejecutivo anunció que, tras realizar un cuidadoso estudio de las presentaciones tanto escritas como orales, efectuadas por ambas delegaciones, se llegó a una decisión unánime, consistente en ratificar y hacer suya la recomendación efectuada por el señor Secretario General de la Organización tras la reunión del 22 de enero de 2007, y en consecuencia, disponer la publicación de las notificaciones rojas respecto de Imad Fayez Moughnieh, Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rabbani, Ahmad Asghari, Ahmad Vahidi y Mohsen Rezai y rechazar la solicitud de Ali Rafsanjani, Ali Velayati y Hadi Soleimapour (éste último sólo solicitado por el Sr. Juez Canicoba Corral). Se informó además que la inscripción de las notificaciones rojas ordenadas por el Comité Ejecutivo tendría lugar a partir del 31 de marzo de 2007, salvo que mediara recurso de apelación por parte de alguna de las OCN involucradas en la controversia, en cuyo caso el asunto sería remitido a consideración de la Asamblea General de la organización que se reuniría en el Reino de Marruecos en el mes de noviembre de 2007. El 22 de marzo de 2007 esta Unidad Fiscal fue notificada que la OCN Teherán había formalmente apelado la decisión del Comité Ejecutivo solicitando que la cuestión fuera planteada ante la Asamblea General, lo que recibió acogida favorable por parte de las autoridades del organismo policial internacional, incluyendo este asunto en el orden del día de la aludida reunión de referida asamblea. Como en las anteriores ocasiones, se entendió conveniente la asistencia del titular y el coordinador general de la Unidad Fiscal, así como integrantes de la OCN Buenos Aires, a la 76a Reunión Anual de la Asamblea General de INTERPOL celebrada en la ciudad de Marrakech, Reino de Marruecos, donde se decidiría el curso de cinco nuevas notificaciones rojas ordenadas en estas actuaciones. El 16 de octubre de 2007 se recibió la comunicación, por parte de la Secretaría General del Organismo Internacional de Policía, del orden del día a tratarse durante la reunión anual. El punto 8 c) tenía previsto resolver el litigio entre Irán y Argentina por la publicación de notificaciones rojas, en razón del recurso presentado por la República Islámica contra la decisión adoptada por el Comité Ejecutivo en marzo de 2007. Pero en forma previa al inicio de las deliberaciones de la Asamblea General, el Comité Ejecutivo del Organismo debió sesionar durante los días 3 y 4 de noviembre de 2007 a raíz del pedido efectuado por la delegación iraní de postergar para el año siguiente el tratamiento de la cuestión. El Comité Ejecutivo rechazó la propuesta de aplazamiento y habilitó a la Asamblea General para tratar el asunto. El día 7 de noviembre de 2007 lo inherente a la inscripción de las notificaciones rojas fue sometido a debate y posterior votación de la ALBERTO NISMAM Ministerio Público de /a Nación	fiscal general Asamblea General de Interpol. En esa oportunidad, luego que uno de los delegados de la parte iraní expusiera su postura ante las representaciones presentes, el suscripto en representación de la delegación argentina rebatió tales alegaciones y brindó los fundamentos que justificaban que sin demora se inscribieran las notificaciones rojas. Finalizadas las exposiciones, las misiones presentes votaron. La posición argentina fue aprobada por 78 votos a favor, 14 en contra y 26 abstenciones. De acuerdo a ello, el órgano rector de la Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal dio pleno aval a la postura propiciada por la delegación argentina y como consecuencia ordenó la inscripción en carácter de notificación roja de los pedidos de captura librados contra los ciudadanos iraníes Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rezai, Ahmad Vahidi, Mohsen Rabbani y Ahmad Reza Asghari, que se sumaron así al ya vigente del libanés Imad Fayez Moughnieh. El 13 de noviembre de 2007 se recibió en el sumario la comunicación formal de Interpol acerca de la efectiva inscripción de tales órdenes de captura. Así, había culminado con éxito un largo e intrincado proceso, que, dadas las vicisitudes del sumario, significó un importante avance con miras al esclarecimiento del hecho. Por ello, la gestión de la Unidad Fiscal a cargo del suscripto logró, por un amplio margen, la publicación definitiva de las notificaciones rojas respecto de los sospechados en la causa, que no sólo implicó -en ese momento- la confirmación del enderezamiento y avance de la investigación, sino también el restablecimiento de la confianza de la comunidad internacional de naciones en la actividad, probidad y eficiencia de la justicia argentina que, en relación a este caso, se había visto seriamente dañada por el proceder del anterior juez. A partir de ello y durante los siguientes años, la República Argentina reclamó a Irán, mediante distintos medios y en distintos foros internacionales, su falta de cooperación con la investigación y su renuencia a extraditar a los acusados. Por su parte, Irán nunca cedió ante los reclamos ni aceptó ninguna de las alternativas que ofreció Argentina para someter a proceso judicial a los imputados iraníes. Hasta que, al menos públicamente, en septiembre de 2012, la Sra. Presidente de la Nación, Cristina Fernández, anunció ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, haber instruido a su Canciller, Héctor Timerman para que inicie un proceso de negociación con Irán en tomo al caso AMIA. De acuerdo a la versión oficial, el Ministro Timerman se reunió por primera vez para tratar este tema con el canciller iraní Ali Akbar Salehi el día 27 de septiembre de 2012. Oficialmente, se comunicaron una serie de encuentros entre representantes de ambos países, sobre los que no se brindaron mayores detalles (Comunicados de Prensa del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de fecha 27/9/12 - N° 313/12; 29/10/12 -N° 353/12-; 31/10/12 — N° 360/12-; 1/12/12 - N° 391/12; 7/1/13 - N° 002/13-). Exactamente cuatro meses más tarde y después de tres reuniones en Suiza, con fecha 27 de enero de 2013, ambos cancilleres coincidieron en Etiopía, donde suscribieron el ’'''Memorándum de Entendimiento entre el Gobierno de la República Argentina y el Gobierno de la República Islámica de Irán sobre los temas vinculados al ataque terrorista a la sede de la AMIA en Buenos Aires el 18 de julio de 1994” (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N°011/13, 27/01/2013). El día 7 de febrero de 2013, la Presidente de la Nación envió el acuerdo al Congreso Nacional para su aprobación (Expediente N° 296/12), debiendo convocar a esos fines a sesiones extraordinarias, dado que el parlamento estaba en receso. Luego del tratamiento en comisiones, ambas cámaras legislativas aprobaron el acuerdo, que fue sancionado Ley Nacional N° 26.843 con fecha 27 de febrero y que, al día siguiente, fue promulgada en el Boletín Oficial del 1 de marzo, todos de 2013 (B.O. N° 32.591). Por su parte, con fecha 10 de marzo de 2013, el entonces Presidente de la República Islámica de Irán, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, envió el acuerdo a su parlamento (Majlis), que el 21 de marzo entró en receso por el Año Nuevo del calendario persa (Nouruz) y recién volvió a sesionar a partir del 8 de abril, sin dar tratamiento en ningún momento al memorando, el cual fue eventualmente retirado de la agenda parlamentaria (Pagni, Carlos, “El kirchnerismo, en el peor de los mundos”, La Nación 30/5/13; “El memorandún con Argentina llega al parlamento iraní”, Europa Press, 11/3/2013; Kollmann, Raúl “Con novedades semana a semana”, Página 12, 24/3/13). Más de dos meses después, exactamente el día 20 de mayo de 2013, Alí Pakdaman, entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Buenos Aires, brindó declaraciones a la prensa informando que el día 19 de mayo el Presidente Ahmadinejad había aprobado el acuerdo con su sola firma (“Teherán aprobó el memorándum por el atentado a la AMIA”, Página 12, 20/05/2013; Kollmann, Raúl, “Ahmadinejad eligió la vía expeditiva”, Página 12, 21/05/2013). Pero lo cierto es que nunca se recibió, hasta el momento, notificación formal de esta presunta aprobación (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°110/13, 21/5/13). Con fecha 4 de agosto tuvo lugar la asunción del nuevo Presidente de la República Islámica de Irán, Hassan Rohani, y - en consecuencia- se operaron cambios de autoridades en distintos ámbitos gubernamentales de Teherán. El 28 de septiembre de 2013, transcurrido un año desde el inicio oficializado de las negociaciones, el nuevo Canciller iraní, Mohammad Javad Zarif, se reunió con el Ministro Timerman en la sede de las Naciones Unidas en Nueva York, Estados Unidos. Luego del encuentro, en declaraciones a la prensa, Timerman sostuvo que Javad Zarif le había asegurado que Irán había aprobado el memorando con el aval del Consejo Superior de Seguridad Nacional y del Líder Supremo (Miri, Ignacio, “Timerman dijo que Irán aprobó el pacto por la AMIA, pero aún no rige”, Clarín, 29/09/2013; Pisani, Silvia, “Irán le confirmó a Timerman que ya aprobó el acuerdo”, La Nación, 29/09/2013; “Timerman anunció nueva reunión con Irán en noviembre”, Prensa Argentina, 28/09/2013; “Timerman ratificó la aprobación del memorándum de entendimiento con Irán y un nuevo encuentro”, Télam, 28/09/2013; “Irán aprobó el memorándum de entendimiento por la AMIA”, Página 12, 28/09/2013). Luego de dos meses más de silencio por parte de Irán, funcionarios de ambas cancillerías volvieron a reunirse en Zúrich, los días 20 y 21 de noviembre de 2013, ocasión en que Argentina entregó una propuesta escrita sobre ciertas cuestiones relativas a la implementación del memorando. Irán se comprometió a dar pronta respuesta (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N° 279/13, 24 de noviembre de 2013) Sin embargo, hasta la fecha y a pesar de haber transcurrido más de un año y medio de su firma y sin perjuicio de las distintas declaraciones realizadas por los funcionarios persas, Irán no ha comunicado formalmente ningún tipo de aprobación interna del acuerdo y - en consecuencia - no se ha producido el intercambio de notas verbales que signa la entrada en vigencia del memorando (punto 6). Por otra parte, ante distintos estrados judiciales argentinos se han formalizado diferentes planteos que cuestionan la constitucionalidad del citado memorando. En concreto, con fecha 15 de mayo de 2014, la Sala I de la Cámara en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal de esta ciudad resolvió hacer lugar a la acción de amparo interpuesta por los representantes de AMIA y DAIA y, en consonancia con lo dictaminado por el suscripto, declaró inconstitucionales tanto el Memorándum de Entendimiento como su ley aprobatoria. Asimismo, dicho tribunal ordenó, de modo preventivo, comunicar lo resuelto al Poder Ejecutivo Nacional -en particular, a la Cancillería- para que no ejecute el acuerdo mientras transitan las vías recursivas. La Sala I también le ordenó al juez de la causa, Dr. Canicoba Corral, que reitere por vía diplomática los pedidos de extradición y cooperación judicial a la República Islámica de Irán, que requiera a Interpol que extreme los esfuerzos para hacer efectivas las ordenes de captura e insista al organismo policial para que revea la posibilidad de emitir notificaciones rojas respecto de Rafsanjani, Velayati y Soleimanpour   Ministerio Público de la Nación (CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 “AMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N°6- Secretaría N°ll). Finalmente, cabe tener presente que con fecha 30 de mayo del corriente, el Ministerio de Justicia y Derechos Humanos recurrió la citada resolución de la Alzada Federal. Sin perjuicio de la vital importancia de contar con una decisión definitiva al respecto, lo cierto es que a los fines de la presente denuncia, este derrotero judicial constituye -en todo caso- una cuestión ajena a las conductas que, en sustancia, aquí se han denunciado. b)	La postura de Irán en relación con la causa AMIA: Desde el inicio de la investigación de la causa AMIA y hasta la actualidad, la República Islámica de Irán siempre ha negado oficialmente el involucramiento de sus nacionales en el atentado; ha, además, entorpecido la pesquisa de todas las formas posibles, por ejemplo, intentando desacreditar a las autoridades judiciales intervinientes; incluso ha tildado al gobierno argentino de financiar al terrorismo y ha intentado negociar políticamente -en varias ocasiones- la absolución de los acusados. Esta postura ha sido mantenida inalterada a lo largo de todos estos años, aun con posterioridad a la firma del acuerdo en enero de 2013. La retórica iraní ha reiterado hasta el hartazgo que ninguno de sus nacionales participó en el atentado, que la justicia argentina no es confiable, que Irán condena al terrorismo y que está dispuesto a colaborar con Argentina para dar con los “verdaderos culpables”. Al hablar de “verdaderos culpables”, evidencia su postura: la acusación argentina ha sido fabricada y orquestada por autoridades judiciales que responden al sionismo y a intereses foráneos, con la participación de agencias de inteligencia de Estados Unidos e Israel. Numerosas declaraciones realizadas, a lo largo de los años, por distintos funcionarios persas, dan cuenta de la postura oficial de Irán, a saber: las misivas enviadas por el Embajador iraní ante la ONU, Mohammad Khazaee, al Presidente de la Asamblea General del organismo - fechadas en 28 de septiembre de 2007, 2008, 2009 y 2010-, las acusaciones formales y las tachas de descrédito realizadas por funcionarios iraníes en contra de distintas autoridades judiciales argentinas abocadas a la causa, etc. (cfr.: Documentos A/62/485, A/63/468, 4/64/481 y A/65/495, AGNU, ONU; “Si los desagravian, Irán colaboraría con la causa AMIA”, ADN Mundo, 4/12/2006; “AMIA: Irán pidió ubicar al responsable real”, Perfil, 29/11/2006; “AMIA: Dura advertencia de Irán al gobierno de Kirchner”, Diario de Cuyo, 11/12/2006; “Irán reaccionó con agravios al pedido de Néstor Kirchner”, Infobae, 27/09/2007; “Ahmadinejad dice que quiere expandir las relaciones con la Argentina”, Clarín, 26/09/2013; Dinatale, Martín, “Negó Irán la denuncia del fiscal Nisman y lo acusó de sionista”, La Nación, 4/6/2013; “Para Irán, la causa AMIA causó amargura en las relaciones entre Irán y Argentina”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 16/07/2013; Braslavsky, Guido, “Irán pide a Interpol la captura del fiscal Nisman y de Galeano”, Clarín, 13/11/2006; “AMIA: dura respuesta iraní a los pedidos de capturas”, Infobae, 13/11/2006; Gallo, Daniel, “Irán amenaza con pedir el arresto de agentes de Interpol”, La Nación, 16/03/2007, “Irán volvió a criticar al sionismo”, La Nación, 19/06/2013; Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, “Irán rechazó, otra vez, su participación en la AMIA”, Clarín, 19/06/2013; “Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/02/2013; “Kirchner ordenó expulsar a D'Elía del gobierno”, La Nación, 14/11/2006; “Tensión diplomática y despido de D'Elía”, La Voz, 14/11/2006; “La Cancillería respondió a otra protesta de Irán”, Clarín, 13/12/2006; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicados de Prensa N°528/06 del 13/11/2006; Comunicado de Prensa N°000/07 “Argentina rechaza pedido de exhorto de Irán”, del 14/08/2007, Comunicado de Prensa N°400/07 “La cancillería argentina rechaza declaraciones difundidas por Irán”, del 28/09/2007; “Argentina expresó un categórico rechazo a dichos de Irán”, El Día, 28/09/2007; “Que Irán respete la jurisdicción”, Página 12, 29/09/2007). Puntualmente, en sus cartas al Presidente de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, en los años 2007 a 2010, el Embajador de Irán ante el organismo Mohammad Khazaee, ha realizado afirmaciones del estilo de: “...los autores del atentado con bomba contra la AMIA han quedado impunes y, en su lugar, se ha acusado injusta e infundadamente a varios nacionales iraníes inocentes...” y “...Todos los argumentos contra los nacionales iraníes no son más que una farsa...” (cfr.: Documentos A/62/485, A/63/468, 4/64/481 y A/65/495, AGNU, ONU). Ahora bien, esta posición no está exenta de consecuencias prácticas. La República Islámica nunca ha prestado colaboración a las autoridades judiciales argentinas, pese a declamar reiteradamente lo contrario. De hecho, de 17 cartas rogatorias libradas  a Irán en el marco de la causa judicial requiriendo información para la investigación del atentado, solamente se ha respondido una. Y esa respuesta fue para hacer saber su negativa a cumplir lo solicitado, argumentando excusas insostenibles y rechazando toda cooperación judicial con el caso (fs. 126.761/126.779 y 127.614/127.657). Por lo demás, también han negado rotundamente la solicitud de detención de los imputados con miras a su extradición, que se les formuló mediante exhorto diplomático en el mes de noviembre de 2006 (fs. 127.063/127.080 y 128.205/128.220). En rigor de verdad, es realmente desvergonzado hablar de cooperación con semejante historial de antecedentes. Por otra parte y como se adelantó, desde el año 2005, en la causa se encuentran acreditados distintos episodios en los cuales autoridades iraníes plantearon, por vías diplomáticas y en forma totalmente indolente, la posibilidad de “negociar” de distintas maneras la extinción de toda investigación, acusación y/o pedido de captura contra sus nacionales (ver fs. 116.381/116.383, 117.251/117.253, 118.680 y 118.952/118.953 bis). En efecto, en más de una ocasión, Irán buscó negociar la impunidad de sus nacionales. Por ejemplo, el 3 de abril de 2005, el Encargado de Negocios de la República Argentina en Irán entregó en mano al Director del Departamento de Asuntos de Derecho Internacional de la Cancillería de ese país, un nuevo exhorto librado en la causa. En esa ocasión, el funcionario iraní condicionó la respuesta de la rogatoria en los siguientes términos: “...Si asistimos al poder judicial argentino: a) ¿No estaremos siendo vistos como acusados o sospechosos? b) Supongamos que recibimos los exhortos y los contestamos [...] Estará el juez dispuesto a anunciar y declarar tajantemente que no existe conexión ni de Irán ni de sus ciudadanos con la explosión de la AMIA? c) ¿Quedará o no el dossier abierto si contestamos? d) ¿cómo podemos saber si el juez cerrará el dossier o no?” Y añadió: “el asunto principal es que de alguna manera podamos estar convencidos de que si colaboramos, el juez de la causa llegará a la conclusión de que el señor X o el señor Y no están ni estuvieron implicados en la explosión de la AMIA. Recuerden que desde el 19 de julio de 1994 nos manifestamos dispuestos a colaborar con la justicia argentina, posición y oferta que continúa aún válida. Si tuviéramos garantías objetivas, cosas tangibles (resultados tangibles) no tendríamos ningún problema en: a) recibir todos los exhortos; b) contestar todos los exhortos: c) incluso más: hacer algunas investigaciones ulteriores en Irán... ” (fs. 116.381/116.383). La misma tónica se repitió por parte de los funcionarios iraníes en la reunión celebrada en Teherán en julio de 2005 entre representantes diplomáticos de nuestro país y el Director de Asuntos de Derecho Internacional local, Dr. Mohsen Baharvand, en relación con los exhortos pendientes de recepción y respuesta por parte del poder judicial iraní. En esa ocasión, el funcionario iraní sostuvo lo siguiente: “Necesitamos de esa visión de perspectiva para poder recibir los exhortos y responderlos, pues tenga en mente que se trata de funcionarios del gobierno iraní y no ciudadanos ordinarios; en definitiva, cada vez que uno tiene algo para dar tiene expectativas de recibir también (...) La parte iraní es sumamente flexible con los exhortos, solo complicamos las cosas cuando es absolutamente necesario (sic) y ese no es el caso de las relaciones con argentina ” (fs. 117.251/117.253). Otro ejemplo de esta actitud iraní en cuanto a su colaboración en la causa surge de un “non paper” entregado por el mencionado Baharvand a diplomáticos argentinos, con una propuesta de acuerdo entre ambos países (fs. 118.680, 118.952/118.953bis). El pacto ofrecido entonces por Irán decía: “1. Las partes aceptan que no ha existido ninguna acusación contra ciudadanos iraníes en relación con la Causa AMIA; no obstante ello, el proceso que sigue el Juez argentino a cargo de la investigación en lo que respecta a los ciudadanos iraníes fue ordenado con el mero fin de recopilar información ”. “2. Las partes... se abstendrán de efectuar cualquier tipo de inferencia criminal, tanto en forma directa como indirecta, o acusación contra la otra parte y sus funcionarios “3... ¡as cartas rogatorias libradas por el Juez de la Argentina serán enmendadas de forma tal que no se formule ningún alegato o acusación, ya sea en forma explícita o implícita, contra el gobierno iraní y sus ciudadanos... ”. ""4. Tras lo dispuesto en el párrafo tercero, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Irán recibirá oficialmente ¡as cartas rogatorias... ”. “5. La parte argentina ...revocará cualquier orden de arresto librada por el Juez a cargo de la investigación contra los ciudadanos de la República Islámica de Irán... La reseña aquí efectuada revela la insólita postura asumida por el gobierno iraní en el sentido de condicionar su colaboración al compromiso de las autoridades judiciales argentinas de no incriminar a funcionarios y/o ciudadanos de ese país. Por otra parte y con motivo de dos solicitudes dirigidas a obtener información sobre titulares de líneas telefónicas, las autoridades iraníes, a través de Interpol Teherán, respondieron, a la primera de ellas: “no nos es posible responder vuestra solicitud debido la importancia del respeto de los principios y de las reglas de los derechos humanos, y también de las leyes internas de Irán acerca del respeto de la vida privada de las personas” (fs. 908 del legajo 391). En el restante pedido, lejos de brindar la información requerida, se limitaron a señalar: “...favor de explicarnos el motivo e informarnos también de dónde obtuvieron estos números de teléfono... ” (fs. 6843 del legajo 201). Sentado ello, no puede menos que considerarse absurdas y descabelladas las excusas brindadas por el régimen iraní para no dar respuesta a las solicitudes argentinas, con el agravante de que, aun cuando luego fueron enviados a Teherán los datos requeridos, ni siquiera así se obtuvo contestación. Más allá de la prueba documental, este tipo de ofrecimientos fueron reconocidos por varios funcionarios argentinos de entonces que, dadas sus posiciones en puestos claves, tomaron conocimiento de distintas propuestas de Irán para dejar de lado la imputación por AMIA. Al respecto, cabe recordar un acuerdo rechazado por Néstor Kirchner del cual dieron cuenta el ex Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fernández y el ex Vice Canciller, Roberto García Moritán. Por su parte, los ex Cancilleres Rafael Bielsa y Jorge Taiana, pusieron de manifiesto la postura de Irán aquí descripta, conforme observaron durante sus respectivas gestiones en el Palacio San Martín. Rafael Bielsa mencionó la oferta iraní de cuatro mil millones de dólares en compras de maíz y trigo para retomar así el comercio bilateral, pero a condición de dejar de lado la causa AMIA. Expresó: “...era una actitud extorsiva... ” y al describir el desempeño de la diplomacia iraní en general refirió:	“Siempre nos estaban haciendo trampa...les explicábamos que acá el Poder Ejecutivo no le da órdenes al Judicial, muchísimo menos en una causa de esta naturaleza. Ellos se hacían los que no entendían...”. Y agregó: “...Es un país manifiestamente hostil que se ha negado a contestar todos los exhortos... Les decíamos: los vamos a seguir hasta debajo de ¡a cama, acá no hay arreglo, contesten los exhortos. Uno de sus argumentos era: se están perdiendo 4 mil millones de dólares...Jamás hubo la más mínima concesión...ellos querían que un punto sugiriera que podía haber algún error por parte del Poder Judicial en el requerimiento de estos dignatarios iraníes...” (el resaltado es propio, Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013; “Causa AMIA: Para D'Elía, los acusados iraníes van a ser sobreseídos”, Infobae, 1/3/2013, “Irán le ofreció un acuerdo igual a Néstor Kirchner, pero lo rechazó”, Infobae, 14/02/2013; “Duro cruce de acusaciones entre Timerman y García Moritán”, La Nación, 19/02/2013; “Alberto Fernández: Néstor Kirchner siempre se negó a un acuerdo con Irán”, Iprofesional, 20/02/2013). En la misma línea, el ex Canciller Jorge Taiana aseveró que los iraníes habían mostrado “falta de voluntad” dado que “ni siquiera recibían las solicitudes, o sea, las rechazaban y descalificaban. No hubo ninguna muestra de que existiera la más mínima voluntad de ayudar a esclarecer el hecho...” (Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013). Incluso, las autoridades persas se han valido de ciudadanos argentinos profundamente consustanciados con las ideas del régimen y, al mismo tiempo, con vínculos con las autoridades del gobierno argentino, como Luis D’Elía, para hacer llegar sus propuestas de una solución favorable a sus intereses en torno a las imputaciones del caso AMIA. Efectivamente, el régimen de Irán aprovechó un viaje realizado por Luis D’Elía, Fernando Esteche y Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, a fines de febrero y principios de marzo de 2010, para proponer un acuerdo relacionado con el atentado (“Quejas de Israel por el viaje de D'Elía a Irán”, La Nación, 07/03/2010; “D'Elía admitió un encuentro con un ex funcionario iraní prófugo en la causa AMIA”, La Prensa, 07/03/2010; “D’Elía y Esteche vieron en Irán a un sospechoso de volar la AMIA”, Perfil, 06/03/2010; “D'Elía sigue defendiendo al prófugo de la AMIA: Es una buena persona”, Clarín, 09/03/2010; “Diputados repudió el viaje de D’Elía a Irán y pidió informes a Cancillería”, Infobae, 07/04/2010). Increíblemente ahora se constata que dicho acuerdo era similar al Memorando de Entendimiento firmado por el canciller Timerman en enero del año pasado. Así lo recordó D’Elía al manifestarle a Khalil: “...Es parecido a lo que nos propusieron en el primer viaje a Teherán ¿te acordás?...” (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado N°11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-174637-12, CD 266). Esto da la pauta, como se analizará y acreditará en detalle en el acápite correspondiente, que el instrumento jurídico que han firmado Argentina e Irán nada tiene que ver con la búsqueda de justicia ni con el avance de la investigación sino que se trata de uno de los medios elegidos para conseguir un fin delictivo y atroz: garantizar la impunidad definitiva a los acusados iraníes de la causa por el atentado contra la AMIA a través de un salvoconducto con apariencia de legalidad. Finalmente, cabe recordar, solo a modo de ejemplo porque fueron muchos los intentos de Teherán en este sentido, que en septiembre de 2007, el entonces vocero del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Irán, Mohammad Alí Hosseini, ofreció: “Como acto humanitario y para esclarecer los hechos de esta tragedia, la República Islámica anunció de antemano admitir la formación de un comité jurídico bilateral con Argentina, a pesar de la ausencia de acuerdo y desavenencia que hay entre los aparatos judiciales de ambos países'’’’ (“Irán reaccionó con agravios al pedido de Néstor Kirchner”, Infobae, 27/09/2007). Obviamente, ese ofrecimiento -no muy distinto al acuerdo firmado- fue rechazado por Néstor Kirchner. En fin, Irán siempre sostuvo y pidió lo mismo, lo que confirma que en dicho país existió y existe la decisión política no solo de no cooperar y de no reconocer la soberanía jurisdiccional argentina en el caso, sino de entorpecer y atacar todo avance que se realice. Ahora bien, resulta claro que la elocuente falta de cooperación exhibida por las autoridades iraníes respecto de esta investigación, es el reflejo, o bien la consecuencia, de la estrategia históricamente sostenida por el régimen de Teherán que consistió y consiste aún hoy en negar toda relación de sus ciudadanos con el atentado y jamás brindar cualquier tipo de información a la pesquisa para, así, desligar toda responsabilidad que le pudiera caber por actos de terrorismo, negando la detención con fines de extradición de los individuos que la justicia argentina ha imputado judicialmente por el hecho y buscando deslegitimar -de distintas formas- a la investigación y a las autoridades que la encabezan. Eso demuestra que existe una decisión política para garantizar impunidad tomada por las más altas autoridades del régimen, que también planificaron y ordenaron el atentado que acabó con la vida de 85 personas. Sin perjuicio de la firme negativa del régimen, se han obtenido declaraciones reveladoras de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, representante de los intereses y agente orgánico de Irán en Argentina y partícipe activo del encubrimiento aquí denunciado, que reconocen la responsabilidad de funcionarios iraníes en los atentados en Argentina. En referencia a un individuo señaló: “...la persona que taburó con Irán...cuando Irán mató acá” (Comunicación del 19/11/12, abonado N°11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2012-11-19-083552-16, CD 197). En otra oportunidad, confesó que el Subsecretario de Agricultura Familiar para la Nación y líder del Movimiento Evita, Emilio Pérsico: “...siempre tuvo el discurso de que nosotros fuimos....y está bien hecho... as i dice él. Es la pelea” (Comunicación del 15/8/13, abonado N°11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-08-15-234919-2, CD 118). Es decir, que los iraníes fueron los responsables del atentado y que a entender de Pérsico estaban justificados por su lucha política. En igual sentido, citando a D’Elía, Pérsico: ""...fue el que dijo que ustedes fueron el tema AMIA...”, en alusión a la responsabilidad de iraníes por el atentado (Comunicación del 15/8/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-08-15-234225-2, CD 118). Estas referencias solo deben ser entendidas como meros ejemplos y, en modo alguno, como nuevas pruebas para fundar la acusación por el atentado, que -como se sabe- ya ha sido volcada en anteriores dictámenes fiscales y en los pronunciamientos del Juez de la causa, Dr. Canicoba Corral. Estas manifestaciones tampoco hacen a la prueba del encubrimiento, sin embargo permiten visualizar que la estrategia del régimen de la República Islámica de Irán de negación perpetua rindió sus frutos. Es decir, a pesar de ser efectivamente responsables por el atentado, la circunstancia de haberlo negado por lustros y lustros acabó desembocando en este plan encubridor que pretendió desacreditar a la justicia argentina y, fundamentalmente, estuvo dirigido a garantizar la impunidad total y definitiva de los acusados iraníes. De hecho, según surge del documento que bajo juramento declaró haber leído el Sr. José Eliaschev, la solidez de la postura iraní de no cooperar judicialmente ni ceder un ápice antes las acusaciones argentinas fue reconocida por el ex canciller iraní Ali Akbar Salehi como una exitosa estrategia del Líder Supremo. Salehi elogió esta estrategia cuando -como se verá más adelante-, en enero de 2011, Héctor Timerman abandonó el reclamo argentino de justicia y le ofreció articular un modo para dejar de lado las acusaciones por el atentado y retomar el comercio bilateral (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913). En suma, Irán nunca tuvo intención de cooperar y, en la práctica, siempre estorbó la actuación judicial argentina y los acercamientos diplomáticos, políticos y judiciales que aceptó tuvieron por única finalidad extinguir las acusaciones contra sus nacionales y desvincular a Irán del caso, aunque ello se derivara de la aplicación de medios prohibidos. Resulta útil destacar que esta estrategia no solamente ha sido implementada por Teherán respecto al caso AMIA, sino que también fue   Ministerio Público de la Nación replicada en relación a otros atentados terroristas perpetrados en distintos rincones del planeta donde, también fundadamente, se ha involucrado judicialmente a funcionarios del régimen iraní como responsable de hechos de terrorismo. Jamás se ha advertido cambio alguno en la postura iraní, que ni siquiera morigeró su clásica retórica después de iniciadas oficialmente las negociaciones y aún luego de haber firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, alegando “de la boca para afuera”, como es su costumbre, su buena predisposición para el diálogo y la negociación, al tiempo que, en los hechos, buscaba deslegitimar por cualquier medio los pronunciamientos de la justicia argentina y, consecuentemente, también a sus funcionarios. En esta línea se inscriben los siguientes cuatro episodios, solo a modo de ejemplo: 1) el entonces portavoz de la cancillería iraní, Ramin Mehmanparast, declaró en octubre de 2012 -cuando las negociaciones ya eran públicas- que se rechazaban las acusaciones contra ciudadanos iraníes y que su gobierno estaba dispuesto a colaborar para dar con los ejecutores del atentado (“Irán volvió a rechazar todas las acusaciones por el atentado a la AMIA”, La Nación, 30/10/2012; Paraszczuk, Joanna, “Irán ready to identify AMIA bombing perpetrators”, Jerusalem Post, 30/10/12; Kollmann, Raúl: “Irán volvió a negar su culpabilidad”, Página 12, 31/10/12); 2) según un cable de la agencia IRNA, la postura oficial de Irán -ya firmado el acuerdo con Argentina- era que el atentado podría haber sido planeado por Israel: “...Irán dice que agentes de Tel Aviv estuvieron involucrados en el ataque...con el objetivo de aumentar su influencia sobre el gobierno de entonces en Buenos Aires...” (“Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/02/2013; “FM: Irán, Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, Irán Daily Brief, 14/2/13; “El Canciller de Irán dice que negoció durante dos años el acuerdo con Argentina”, Clarín, 12/02/2013; “Salehi: Irán Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, IRNA, 12/02/2013); 3) las expresiones de la cancillería iraní que buscaron deslegitimar el trabajo de la Unidad Fiscal a cargo del suscripto y el dictamen de fecha 29/05/2013 sosteniendo: “...Debido a la historia y carácter sionista de ese fiscal [por Nisman], nosotros no damos ninguna importancia a sus afirmaciones...” (“Irán rechazó las acusaciones del fiscal Alberto Nisman al considerarlo sionista”, La Nación, 3/6/2013; “El ministerio exteriores de Irán: No le damos importancia a las declaraciones de Nisman”, IRNA, 5/6/2013); 4) en junio de 2013, ya firmado el acuerdo, otro vocero de la cancillería iraní -Abbas Araqchi- volvió a rechazar la participación de iraníes en el atentado, declaró que para Teherán fueron agentes extranjeros y sionistas los que estuvieron detrás del ataque y agregó: “Gracias a Dios, con la colaboración de los cancilleres de Irán y la Argentina, se está viendo la manera razonable para solucionar el tema de la AMIA, y está habiendo una mayor comprensión de que los factores extranjeros y sionistas fueron los verdaderos causantes de este lamentable hecho...” (Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, “Irán rechazó, otra vez, su participación en la AMIA”, Clarín, 19/06/2013; “Irán volvió a criticar al sionismo”, La Nación, 19/06/2013), acusaciones que reiteraría el mismo portavoz en julio de 2013 (“Para Irán, la causa AMIA causó amargura en las relaciones entre Irán y Argentina”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 16/07/2013). Nunca antes el gobierno argentino había permanecido mudo ante este tipo de declaraciones. Pero desde que se produjo el acercamiento con Irán, comenzó un silencio cómplice de parte de las autoridades argentinas aquí denunciadas ante este tipo de expresiones y/o ataques a los actos jurisdiccionales soberanos de distintos órganos de la república, variando la postura que se mantuvo inalterada durante el mandato de Néstor Kirchner, lo que constituye un nuevo indicio de la existencia de un acuerdo previo entre las dos partes que -desafortunadamente- tuvo por norte el plan de encubrimiento aquí denunciado, en el cual las autoridades argentinas se mostraron más interesadas en avanzar que su contraparte. Así, el incomprensible silencio del gobierno argentino, mantenido a pesar de la gravedad de las acusaciones y desacreditaciones por parte de las autoridades del gobierno iraní, habla por sí solo en este nuevo contexto. Es decir, las autoridades iraníes persisten, hasta el presente, no solo en negar oficialmente toda colaboración de Irán con el caso, sino - fundamentalmente- agrediendo y buscando desacreditar de distintas formas la acusación de la justicia argentina, pretendiendo poner en duda la imparcialidad de las investigaciones y sugiriendo -siempre- la influencia de intereses foráneos que habían sesgado la pesquisa aviesamente en contra de Irán. Más recientemente y en ocasión del fallo de la Cámara en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal que declaró la inconstitucionalidad del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado con Irán, y de su ley aprobatoria, las autoridades iraníes tuvieron una reacción a todas luces provocativa, teniendo en cuenta, fundamentalmente, su parsimonia en tomo a la aprobación del acuerdo. En esa oportunidad, la vocera del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores, Marziyeh Afkham, condenó fuertemente el fallo y declaró: “El gobierno iraní cree que el Memorando de Entendimiento era una solución adecuada y una oportunidad para descubrir los hechos relativos a la tragedia de la AMIA y la resolución de las diferencias al respecto, pero la decisión de la corte argentina priva a ambas partes de esa oportunidad. Por ¡o tanto, la República Islámica de Irán expresa su pesar y descontento por la decisión’’’ (“Irán criticizes Argentine court decisión to declare unconstitutional joint AMIA bombing probe with Irán”, IRNA, 16/05/2014; “Irán slams argentine court ruling on AMIA probe”, Fars News Agency, 17/05/2014; “Irán condemns argentine court ruling on AMIA probe”, PressTV, 16/05/2014; Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, “Irán lamenta la decisión de la Justicia argentina”, Clarín, 16/05/2014; “Irán expresó pesar y descontento por el fallo que invalidó el memorándum sobre el atentado a la AMIA”, La Nación, 16/05/2014). El doble discurso no solo es patrimonio exclusivo de las autoridades argentinas aquí denunciadas. Los iraníes han sabido utilizarlo a la perfección. Es decir que, a pesar del tiempo transcurrido sin que exista comunicación oficial de aprobación interna del acuerdo por parte de Irán, sus autoridades sostuvieron públicamente su interés en el pacto. Nuevamente, la kilométrica distancia entre las palabras y los hechos. Finalmente, solo resta destacar que la retórica de negación y obstrucción iraní tuvo excelente resonancia en el gobierno de Cristina Fernández y, según se verá más adelante, fue usufructuada por las autoridades argentinas aquí denunciadas, para avanzar con las maniobras de encubrimiento e impunidad de los acusados. c)	Presidencia de Néstor Carlos Kirchner Durante el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner la posición de la República Argentina en relación al atentado contra la AMIA fue clara y consistente: todos los esfuerzos políticos se enderezaron a respaldar el accionar de la justicia argentina y, desde el ámbito de sus competencias, el entonces Presidente de la Nación intentó lograr la cooperación de Irán y el aval de la comunidad internacional. Es decir, durante todo su mandato, se mantuvo de manera inconmovible el apoyo del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional a las conclusiones de este Ministerio Público y a las decisiones del Poder Judicial en tomo a la causa. El caso AMIA fue una política de Estado. Este respaldo se tradujo en distintas acciones concretas, que van desde la desclasificación de información de inteligencia (Decreto N° 787 del 17 de septiembre de 2003) y la creación de esta Unidad Fiscal de Investigación en el año 2004 (Resolución MP 84/04), hasta el discurso pronunciado por el ex Presidente en el año 2007 ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, cuando denunció la falta de colaboración de Irán y solicitó que “la República Islámica de Irán, en el marco del derecho internacional aplicable, acepte y respete la jurisdicción de la justicia argentina, y colabore eficazmente con los jueces argentinos para lograr el sometimiento a juicio de las personas imputadas en aquellos hechos’’'’ (Discurso de Néstor Kirchner en la 62a Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 25 de septiembre de 2007). 2	Se trata de: Alí Akbar Hashemi Bahramaie Rafsanjani (a la época de los hechos presidente de la República Islámica de Irán), Alí Fallahijan (por entonces Ministro de Información iraní), Alí Akbar Velayati (en aquel tiempo Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de la nación persa), Mohsen Rezai (por entonces a cargo del Cuerpo de la Guardia Revolucionaria “Pasdaran”), Ahmad Vahidi (en aquella época a cargo de la fuerza de elite “Al Quds” perteneciente a la Guardia Revolucionaria), Mohsen Rabbani (al tiempo de los hechos Consejero Cultural de la Embajada iraní en nuestro país), Ahmad Reza Asghari o Mohsen Randjbaran (en aquel entonces Tercer Secretario de la representación diplomática iraní en nuestro medio), Hadi Soleimanpour (en aquella época Embajador de la República Islámica de Irán en Buenos Aires) e Imad Fayez Moughnieh (por entonces a cargo del Servicio Exterior del Hezbollah). Moughnieh era el único libanés en aquel resolutorio. Los demás eran todos ciudadanos iraníes. La Unidad Fiscal no formuló imputación a Hadi Soleimanpour, sin perjuicio de lo cual, el Sr. Juez de la causa fundó la acusación y dispuso también su captura. De ese modo, Néstor Kirchner inauguró este destacable recurso diplomático: peticionar ante la comunidad internacional, utilizando legítima y estratégicamente los foros y la opinión internacionales para poner en evidencia la inadmisible postura iraní, convirtiendo -de ese modo- al descrédito internacional en un factor de presión legítimo y conducente a lograr el objetivo requerido por los órganos judiciales: el sometimiento a proceso de los imputados iraníes para avanzar en el enjuiciamiento de aquellas personas judicialmente responsabilizadas por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA. Además, y en cada oportunidad en que el gobierno de la República Islámica de Irán, a través de declaraciones de sus funcionarios y/o por otras vías, intentó deslegitimar la investigación por el caso AMIA haciendo llegar descalificaciones respecto de los funcionarios intervinientes en la pesquisa y -más aún- cuando se conocieron acusaciones judiciales de Irán contra estos funcionarios, el gobierno del Presidente Néstor Kirchner siempre repudió aquellos descréditos, pidiendo -por las vías diplomáticas correspodientes- las explicaciones a que hubiere lugar, como un modo adecuado de proteger y respaldar el accionar de la justicia argentina. Ejemplo de ello fue la reacción que tuvo el Poder Ejecutivo cuando en el año 2006, se conocieron trascendidos que aseveraban que la justicia iraní solicitaría el arresto y la extradición del suscripto y del Dr. Juan José Galeano, ya separado de la magistratura, ocasión en que la Cancillería argentina no demoró en solicitar explicaciones sobre la cuestión al Encargado de Negocios iraní en Buenos Aires, Mohsen Baharvand, máxima autoridad diplomática persa en territorio nacional (Comunicado de Prensa N°528/06 del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de fecha 13/11/2006; Braslavsky, Guido, “Irán pide a Interpol la captura del fiscal Nisman y de Galeano”, Clarín, 13/11/2006, “AMIA: dura respuesta iraní a los pedidos de capturas”, Infobae, 13/11/2006; “Tensión diplomática y despido de D'Elía”, La Voz, 14/011/2006). Y	no fue la única oportunidad en que la cancillería argentina respondió a protestas indebidas o expresiones desafortunadas, por calificarlas de la forma más benévola, procedentes de funcionarios de Teherán (cfr.: “La Cancillería respondió a otra protesta de Irán”, Clarín, 13/12/2006; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°000/07 “Argentina rechaza pedido de exhorto de Irán”, del 14/08/2007; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°400/07, “La cancillería argentina rechaza declaraciones difundidas por Irán”, del 28/09/2007; “Argentina expresó un categórico rechazo a dichos de Irán”, El Día, 28/09/2007; “Que Irán respete la jurisdicción”, Página 12, 29/09/2007). Como prueba del posicionamiento político-estratégico que Néstor Kirchner adoptó en torno al caso AMIA desde el Palacio San Martín, cabe tener presente las palabras de los ex Cancilleres, Jorge Taiana y Rafael Bielsa. Al respecto, el ex Ministro Taiana sostuvo: “No hubo ningún diálogo. Nuestro planteo era: no se puede hablar de nada mientras no haya colaboración judicial...Nuestra posición fue:	tenemos 85 muertos argentinos y no podemos hacer ninguna concesión ni darle facilidad a un Estado que no muestra signos de buscar algún tipo de solución que ayude a esclarecer el hecho...”. Irán debía entregar a los acusados (Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013). Por su parte, Rafael Bielsa, además de describir la actitud extorsiva y las propuestas de comercio iraníes a cambio de zanjar el tema AMIA, corroboró que el caso para el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner había sido “una política de Estado” y señaló que, en cambio, el gobierno de Cristina Fernández “le dice a los familiares que los que comercian son las empresas y no el Estado. Me parece un argumento pelotudo, me fastidia mucho porque era un tema sagrado para Néstor...” y que: “Cuando era canciller, hablar de venderle o comprarle a Irán era casus belir (el resaltado es propio, Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013).  En lo concerniente al modo de llevar adelante contactos con Teherán, Bielsa destacó que, durante su gestión, la cancillería tenía una política de transparencia con los principales interesados en la causa: '''""Estábamos en permanente contacto con los familiares y la comunidad, informándolos de todo....Cada paso que dábamos, cada memorándum que enviábamos, lo consultábamos con todos, porque era una cuestión muy sensible y estaba siempre el fantasma de las ofertas...'’'1 (Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013). Esto resume la dirección que la política exterior tuvo en aquellos años en lo concerniente al caso AMIA. A nivel local, Néstor Kirchner también mantuvo en todo momento su apoyo a la causa judicial, al punto de separar del cargo a un miembro de su propio gobierno, como ocurrió con el caso de Luis D’Elía. Cabe recordar que en noviembre de 2006, casi inmediatamente después de conocerse la resolución del Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral que decretó las capturas de funcionarios iraníes por estar sospechados de participar en el atentado, el entonces Subsecretario Nacional de Tierras para el Hábitat Social, Sr. Luis D’ Elía, encabezó una protesta contra aquella decisión y emitió un comunicado expresando: “el dictamen judicial que acusa a la República Islámica de Irán por el tema AMIA está profundamente contaminado por circunstancias mundiales ajenas a la búsqueda de la verdad’’ (Comunicado del 13/11/2006, firmado por Luis D'Elía y Juan José Cantiello, entregado al entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Buenos Aires, Mohsen Baharvand). Según trascendió, la protesta en repudio a la decisión de la justicia argentina, llevada a cabo en la Embajada de Irán y liderada por D'Elía -con participación del referente de Irán en Argentina, Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil- había sido incitada por el entonces Embajador de Venezuela en Buenos Aires, Roger Capella. Este diplomático venezolano estaba estrechamente vinculado con Teherán y, ya desde aquellos años, favorecía la relación entre Irán, los imputados iraníes por el caso AMIA y ciertos referentes locales, como Luis D'Elía y Fernando Esteche (“Kirchner ordenó expulsar a D'Elía del gobierno”, La Nación, 14/11/2006; Gallo, Daniel, “Controvertida agenda política del Embajador de Venezuela”, La Nación, 16/11/2006). Tal comportamiento motivó que el ex Presidente Kirchner removiera inmediatamente a Luis D’Elía de su cargo en el Ejecutivo Nacional, al tiempo que se comunicó con su par de Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, quien a los pocos días hizo cesar la misión diplomática del Embajador Capella en Argentina. En otras palabras y en este contexto, Néstor Kirchner no hesitó en intervenir, aunque la cuestión pudiera generar tensiones con un mandatario extranjero, en este caso, Hugo Chávez, entonces presidente de Venezuela. En relación al desplazamiento de D’Elía, funcionarios del gobierno de Kirchner explicaron a la prensa que, a entender del presidente, el ex funcionario: “cruzó una línea infranqueable: nunca jamás, un funcionario del gobierno debe abrir juicios sobre causas judiciales abiertas, y menos si atañen a un tema tan sensible como la voladura de la AMIA” (“Kirchner ordenó expulsar a D'Elía del gobierno”, La Nación, 14/11/2006). También por aquellos años, como quedó expresado en el punto anterior, Néstor Kirchner rechazó distintos intentos iraníes de “negociar” una salida acordada que termine con la investigación judicial en contra de sus nacionales, lo que no solo surge de la causa (ver fs. 116.381/116.383, 117.251/117.253, 118.680 y 118.952/118.953 bis) sino también de lo relatado por los ex Cancilleres Rafael Bielsa y Jorge Taiana, por el ex Jefe de Gabinete Alberto Fernández y por el ex Vice canciller Roberto García Moritán (Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013; “Irán le ofreció un acuerdo igual a Néstor Kirchner, pero lo rechazó”, Infobae, 14/2/03; “Alberto Fernández: Néstor Kirchner siempre se negó a un acuerdo con Irán”, Iprofesional, 20/2/2013). Además de los episodios narrados en el acápite previo, apenas libradas las órdenes de captura, Kirchner rechazó un acuerdo que le ofreció Irán que, según atestiguan funcionarios con conocimiento del hecho, era /VI RF. muy parecido al memorando que terminó firmando Héctor Timerman en Etiopía (“Irán le ofreció un acuerdo igual a Néstor Kirchner, pero lo rechazó”, Infobae, 14/02/2013; “Duro cruce de acusaciones entre Timerman y García Moritán”, La Nación, 19/02/2013; “Alberto Fernández: Néstor Kirchner siempre se negó a un acuerdo con Irán”, Iprofesional, 20/02/2013). La existencia de este antecedente fue confirmada por quien fuera Vice Canciller de 2005 a 2008, Roberto García Moritán, y por el entonces Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fernández, es decir, dos altos funcionarios del gobierno de Néstor Kirchner que, por sus respectivos cargos en el Ejecutivo Nacional, se hallaban directamente involucrados en el tratamiento de estas cuestiones. García Moritán afirmó que los iraníes habían ofrecido un acuerdo que “también tenía 9 puntos y era muy similar al actuar y que “con sus matices, tenía el mismo espíritu” (“Irán le ofreció un acuerdo igual a Néstor Kirchner, pero lo rechazó”, Infobae, 14/2/03). Por su parte, Alberto Fernández aseveró que hubo “una oferta iraní de empezar conversaciones y buscar un mecanismo de salida, con un tercer país o una comisión. Pero Kirchner siempre se negó...Kirchner nunca aceptó hacer estas cosas...” (“Alberto Fernández: Néstor Kirchner siempre se negó a un acuerdo con Irán”, Iprofesional, 20/2/2013). Ante estas declaraciones y buscando ocultar los hechos aquí denunciados, Timerman decidió recurrir a la deslegitimación personal de quienes dieron testimonio sobre esta circunstancia, del mismo modo que ya lo había hecho cuando el periodista José Ricardo Eliaschev comunicó la verdadera entidad de las reuniones en Siria (“Duro cruce de acusaciones entre Timerman y García Moritán”, La Nación, 19/02/2013). En vez de rebatir o responder por los hechos que habían tomado estado público, el Canciller recurrió a la falacia “ad hominem”, para intentar ocultar las circunstancias que hacían al plan criminal. Luego, en ocasión de exponer ante los legisladores, Timerman no tuvo más que reconocer que era cierto lo dicho por García Moritán, en tanto Néstor Kirchner había rechazado un acuerdo con Irán que incluía una comisión, pero para desdibujar los hechos argumentó que lo falso era que dicha propuesta hubiera sido similar al memorando ahora suscripto y señaló: “...rechazamos lo que no incorporaba a la justicia y aceptamos el memorándum que incorpora a la justicia argentina...” (Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Justicia y Asuntos Constitucionales de la Cámara de Diputados, Congreso Nacional, desarrollado el 26 de febrero de 2013). Haber dicho que el acuerdo actual es diferente al rechazado por Kirchner porque el Memorando de Entendimiento ha incorporado a la “justicia”, constituyó una falacia argumentativa, dado que de la propia letra del pacto se desprende que la participación de las autoridades judiciales argentinas está supeditada y mediada por la actuación de la comisión, lo que toma pasible de nulidad cualquier acto que pretenda concebirse como procesal. Como se verá más adelante, no será la única ni la más grave de las faalcias. Y así, mediante estas falsas argumentaciones se buscó ocultar una realidad insoslayable: Cristina Fernández autorizó y Héctor Timerman gestionó y firmó un pacto que Néstor Kirchner nunca hubiera aceptado ni permitido suscribir. Lo afirmado por Roberto García Moritán y Alberto Fernández ha sido corroborado por prueba recientemente obtenida, donde el máximo referente iraní en Argentina, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil reconoció expresamente que el acuerdo firmado con Irán es el mismo que estuvo en danza seis años antes y que en aquel entonces había sido rechazado. En efecto, el 27 de enero de 2013, en sendas comunicaciones, Khalil manifestó en relación al Memorando de Entendimiento: “...lo único que sé, es que es el mismo documento que hicimos nosotros hace seis años y lo presentamos, tanto a la gente de la embajada de Irán como a gente del gobierno...”, “...ese plan lo hicimos con Fernando Esteche hace seis años...”, “...el acuerdo que hicimos hace seis años nosotros con Fernando Esteche y nos trataron de locos a nosotros ...cuando lo planteamos, lo mismo, está escrito, hace seis, siete años, en el 2006...nos dijeron 'están locos, esto no tiene asidero'...hoy lo sacaron...”, “...el mismo, boludo, el mismo pusieron... como lo dijimos nosotros ...todo como lo escribimos con Fernando hace seis años...” (Comunicaciones del 27/01/2013, abonado N°11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l 009-2013-01-27-112032-4, CD 266; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-112552-12, CD 266; Archivo B-l 009-2013-01-27- 113208-14, CD 266). Y a Luis D'Elía, le confesó: “... ¿Sabés quien me lo escribió a mí, ese día, el memorando ese, quién lo escribió?...Fernando...”, en alusión a Esteche (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado N°11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-01-27-174637-12, CD 266). Lo cierto es que en todos los casos, el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner entendió -justamente- que estas propuestas conllevaban una injerencia inadecuada del Ejecutivo en el ámbito judicial y - fundamentalmente- representaban una claudicación en el reclamo legítimo de memoria y justicia por el caso AMIA. En suma, durante todo su mandato y podría decirse mientras vivió, el ex Presidente Néstor Kirchner fue consecuente con su postura con el caso AMIA: un fuerte reclamo a Irán por su falta de cooperación en la causa, la firme decisión de rechazar las propuestas iraníes que propiciaban dejar de lado las conclusiones de la justicia argentina y su inestimable apoyo a lo actuado por ella en la investigación por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA fueron los ejes centrales de esta política de estado. a)	Presidencia de Cristina Elisabet Fernández La línea forjada por Néstor Kirchner en torno al caso continuó durante los primeros años del mandato de su esposa Cristina Fernández, quien también, en la sede de las Naciones Unidas, reclamó a Irán por su negativa a permitir que los imputados sean sometidos a la justicia argentina. La inconmovible negativa iraní a cumplir con este legítimo requerimiento fue logrando, de algún modo, erosionar las expectativas del gobierno nacional en los últimos años y, en consecuencia, los reclamos articulados desde entonces evidenciaron condicionamientos que, en cierta medida, los hicieron contraer. En este sentido, el ofrecimiento de realizar el juicio en un tercer país y/o ante la presencia de veedores internacionales representó cierta flexibilización -legítima, por cierto- de la demanda inicial. Sin embargo, aún en esas instancias, el objetivo perseguido consistió siempre en que Irán someta a los imputados a nuestra jurisdicción, es decir, a nuestras leyes, nuestros jueces y a nuestra investigación. Justamente, en esa línea, el 24 de septiembre de 2010, la Sra. Presidente Cristina Fernández se dirigió a la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas y ofreció la posibilidad de elegir de común acuerdo un tercer país en donde llevar a cabo el enjuiciamiento de los ciudadanos iraníes acusados por el atentado (Discurso de Cristina Fernández en la 65° Asamblea General de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2010). Dicha oferta fue respondida mediante una carta del Representante Permanente de la República Islámica de Irán ante Naciones Unidas, Embajador Mohammed Khazaee, en la cual expresó que las acusaciones argentinas carecían de fundamento y que la actual investigación transitaba un ''''camino equivocado” que no llevaría a encontrar a los “auténticos autores” del atentado. Tachó de falsa, arbitraria e infundada la acusación a los ciudadanos iraníes, afirmando que el procedimiento judicial argentino estaba plagado de irregularidades, violaba garantías procesales y derechos fundamentales y no tenía por fin la verdad y la justicia. Asimismo, aseveró que: “El Gobierno de la República Islámica del Irán se ha cerciorado de que ningún ciudadano iraní estuvo implicado, directa o indirectamente, en la explosión del AMIA”. Y acusó a las autoridades argentinas de colaborar y financiar a grupos terroristas -como los Muyahidin Jalq- para, finalmente, afirmar que había sido el gobierno argentino el que -hasta ese momento- se había sistemáticamente negado a negociar un marco jurídico de cooperación en cuestiones judiciales, insistiendo en imponer sus decisiones unilaterales (Carta del 28 de septiembre de 2010 dirigida al Presidente de la Asamblea General por el Representante Permanente de la República Islámica de Irán ante las /\: ^f-RTO NISMA Ministerio Público de la Nación	riscAL; ■- Naciones Unidas, Mohammad Khazaee). En suma, este último ofrecimiento de la Dra. Fernández quedó trunco por una nueva respuesta de Teherán, tan falsa como provocativa. Hasta aquí, se ha demostrado la consistencia que durante años tuvo la postura oficial argentina en torno al caso AMIA, durante todo el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner y parte del mandato de Cristina Fernández, hasta que, como se verá a continuación, tuvo lugar un cambio radical en la política del gobierno nacional vinculado -y así se sostiene en la presente denuncia- a la decisión de la Sra. Presidente, instrumentada especialmente por su Canciller Héctor Marcos Timerman, juntamente con terceros, de avanzar en un plan encubridor que permita a los imputados de nacionalidad iraní eludir y/o sustraerse de la acción de la justicia, a efectos de facilitar un acercamiento geolpolítico e intercambios comerciales a nivel estatal con la República Islámica de Irán, siendo éstos -a juzgar por la prueba reunida- los principales pero no los únicos motivos. Debe quedar claro que no se está cuestionando un cambio de política exterior -resorte exclusivo del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional y por lo tanto, tema no judiciable-, sino que se denuncia que se haya optado lisa y llanamente por el camino del delito, para borrar una acusación y una investigación judicial en pleno trámite. IV.	- El plan de encubrimiento de los imputados iraníes en la causa AMIA La Sra. Presidente de la Nación, Cristina Fernández, decidió restablecer relaciones interestatales con Irán. Sabía que para hacerlo plenamente, sin restricciones, debía encausar de algún modo la causa AMIA, que estaba pendiente desde hace años, obstruyendo la agenda bilateral, en virtud de las capturas ordenadas, ratificadas y nunca concretadas. Para abordar y resolver este tema, la Dra. Fernández, junto a su Canciller, Héctor Timerman, orquestaron y ejecutaron un plan delictivo destinado a garantizar la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iraníes, desvinculándolos fraudulentamente de la pesquisa, y redireccionando la investigación hacia una pista falsa, con otros imputados. Para ello, mantuvieron negociaciones ocultas con representantes iraníes, por más de un año y medio, a los que se sumaron otros cuatro meses de negociaciones oficiales. Estas tratativas culminaron en la firma del “Memorando de Entendimiento”, suscripto en enero de 2013, una pieza central del plan criminal, dado que sus disposiciones contienen distintos recursos y mecanismos aptos para viabilizar el encubrimiento, con la apariencia de legalidad que la maniobra requiere para ser efectiva. Irán fue atraído al plan, y así se probará a continuación, por la promesa del Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores argentino de permitir la baja de las notificaciones rojas que pesaban y pesan sobre cinco de sus nacionales. Ello, y así lo indican varios elementos, fue acordado secretamente por Timerman y Salehi por fuera del texto del acuerdo. La frustración de este objetivo, por la intervención de terceros ajenos a la maniobra -Interpol-, desalentó la predisposición iraní hacia el tema, sin que ello impeda el avance del plan criminal por parte de las autoridades argentinas denunciadas, que siguió operativo. Precisamente, en este punto se analizará de forma completa, el plan de impunidad llevado adelante, que incluye: la decisión de encubrir, la predisposición de ciertas autoridades ejecutivas argentinas a abandonar el reclamo de justicia, la negociación secreta con Irán y los intentos por mantenerla oculta, la negociación pública cuyo contenido también se mantuvo en secreto, el interés por el petróleo iraní, las razones geopolíticas de realineamiento con Teherán, la prometida aquiescencia de Timerman para el cese de las notificaciones rojas, la existencia de compromisos secretos por fuera del Memorando y el armado de una falsa hipótesis alternativa para desplazar las acusaciones judiciales contra los iraníes. Ministerio Público de la Nación ""^Tlberto nis^an FISCAL GENERAL Asimismo, se examinará en detalle el texto del Memorando de Entendimiento y se demostrará cómo sus disposiciones viabilizan ciertos aspectos del plan criminal. a)	La decisión de encubrir: Naturalmente, la decisión de la Presidente Fernández de restablecer relaciones con la República Islámica de Irán no es cuestionable judicialmente. Aquí no se denuncia ni es materia de crítica el cambio en el enfoque político de una cuestión por parte del gobierno o sus funcionarios, ni tampoco el giro en el modo de relacionarse intemacionalmente ante un conflicto y/o con otros estados. Ni siquiera se denuncia ni mucho menos se cuestiona el mero hecho de entablar negociaciones con la República Islámica de Irán en particular, ya sean comerciales o aún respecto a la causa AMIA. Está claro que todas estas cuestiones y acciones corresponden al ámbito exclusivo y excluyente del Poder Ejecutivo que, por ejercer la jefatura suprema de la Nación, la jefatura de gobierno y la administración general del país, cuenta con la potestad constitucional de concluir y firmar tratados y celebrar negociaciones para el mantenimiento de las buenas relaciones con naciones extranjeras (art. 99 inc. 1 y 11 de la Constitución Nacional). Nada de esto está en discusión. La decisión de poner en marcha una negociación con las autoridades iraníes o el mismo hecho de arribar a un acuerdo con ese gobierno, constituyen -en principio- la concreción de una estrategia y de una acción de política exterior de carácter discrecional y de exclusivo resorte del órgano ejecutivo, cuyo ejercicio escapa al control judicial. Ahora, si bien es cierto que la materia, oportunidad y conveniencia de lo actuado resulta ajena al conocimiento de los jueces, el Poder Judicial se encuentra obligado a intervenir cuando la ejecución de ciertos actos, aún dentro de las competencias asignadas constitucionalmente, conlleve la comisión de delitos. En otras palabras, si la negociación solamente hubiera excedido los límites constitucionales en razón a la competencia de los poderes del estado, alcanzaría con la sanción de inconstitucionalidad. Pero aquí hay algo más serio. Se trata de una acción que no solamente es inconstitucional, sino delictiva, toda vez que los actos realizados, destinados a encubrir a los imputados por este atentado, configuran conductas reprimidas por el derecho penal argentino. En consecuencia, detrás de un objetivo que puede considerarse legítimo, como el restablecimiento de relaciones plenas y comerciales con Irán, y más allá de que hayan sido las autoridades competentes las que intervinieron en el acercamiento, resulta penalmente cuestionable suprimir mediante maniobras delictivas el objetivo de alcanzar la justicia en el atentado más sangriento perpetrado en territorio argentino. El momento en que la Sra. Presidente tomó la determinación delictiva de ayudar a los imputados iraníes a eludir la actuación de la justicia debe situarse entre fines del mes de octubre de 2010 y el mes de enero de 2011. Varias razones convergen en ubicar temporalmente la decisión entre esas fechas. Existen dos hechos, datados en agosto y septiembre de 2010, que indican que hasta esas fechas, no se habían registrado cambios en el rumbo de la política argentina en tomo al caso AMIA, esto es, la decisión de encubrir aún no había sido tomada. El primero de estos hechos tuvo lugar el día 11 de agosto de 2010,	cuando el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores Timerman mantuvo una reunión con la Secretaria de Estado de Estados Unidos. En esa ocasión, la Sra. Hillary Clinton destacó la cooperación mutua entre ambos países en la lucha contra el terrorismo y señaló que su nación apoyaba el reclamo de justicia argentino por los deplorables y trágicos atentados terroristas sufridos (Declaraciones de la Secretaria de Estado Hillary Rodham Clinton con el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Argentina Héctor Timerman, 11/08/2010, Departamento de Estado, Estados Unidos). Luego de la conferencia de prensa brindada junto a la Secretaria Clinton y consultado sobre la relación con Irán, Timerman declaró: “tenemos una situación muy compleja. Hemos obtenido pruebas ALBERTO NISMA FISCAL GENERAL sobre la participación de ciertos funcionarios iraníes en el ataque contra la embajada judía  en Buenos Aires. Interpol aceptó estas pruebas y hemos pedido su captura....La Argentina no busca ninguna operación de ningún tipo que no sea la justicia. Queremos una solución de este problema gravísimo''' (“Timerman aseguró que el diálogo EEUU-UNASUR es posible y deseable”, Prensa Argentina, 11/08/2010; Barón, Ana. “Timerman, con Hillary: apoyo por Irán y diferencias por Honduras”, Clarín, 12/08/10).- A1 respecto, se reportó también que la Secretaria de Estado Norteamericana “reiteró el apoyo de su país a la Argentina en su reclamo a Irán de que entregue a los sospechosos de un atentado contra la mutual judía AMIA” y que puntualmente respaldó “...el pedido de captura de los seis iraníes (incluyendo al actual ministro de defensa iraní Ahmad Vahidi) y un libanés...” (“Hillary apoyó el pedido argentino a Irán por atentado a la AMIA”, Clarín, 11/08/2010; Barón, Ana. “Timerman, con Hilary: apoyo por Irán y diferencias por Honduras”, Clarín, 12/08/10).- Sobre ese mismo tema, tiempo antes de que se inicien los contactos directos y secretos con los iraníes, Timerman declaró: “...pude conectar que un atentado que se frustró en Estados Unidos al aeropuerto JFK involucraba a Mohsen Rabbani, el que era agregado cultural de la embajada de Irán en Buenos Aires. No lo sabía ni Hillary Clinton ni la gente que investiga acá. Ahora hay una conexión entre un atentado que se frustró en Estados Unidos y el de la AMIA...'''' (Cibeira, Fernando. “Hay que relacionarse sin intermediarios” Reportaje a Héctor Timerman, Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Página 12, 9/01/2011). Es decir, hasta aquel momento, Héctor Timerman lucía comprometido, desde su posición política de canciller, con la acusación judicial contra los imputados iraníes y con la tarea de sumar apoyo internacional al reclamo argentino de justicia. El segundo hecho destacable corresponde a lo ocurrido el 24 de septiembre de 2010, cuando la Sra. Presidente se dirigió -tal como anualmente lo viene haciendo- a la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas y, en relación al tema AMIA, ofreció a la República Islámica de Irán la posibilidad de elegir, de común acuerdo, un tercer país donde llevar a cabo el enjuiciamiento de los ciudadanos iraníes acusados por el atentado, con la participación de observadores internacionales (Discurso de Cristina Fernández en la 65° Asamblea General de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2010). La respuesta de Irán a la propuesta argentina llegó cuatro días después. En una misiva dirigida al Presidente de la Asamblea General, el Representante Permanente de la República Islámica de Irán ante Naciones Unidas, Embajador Mohammad Khazaee, reiteró -una vez más- la histórica postura de Irán en torno a este caso (Carta de fecha 28 de septiembre de 2010 dirigida al Presidente de la Asamblea General por el Representante Permanente de la República Islámica de Irán ante Naciones Unidas, Mohammad Khazaee, A/65/495, distribuida el 6/10/10).- Es decir, mientras las autoridades políticas argentinas aún intentaban avanzar en su reclamo de justicia, quizás con un ofrecimiento menos ambicioso, la diplomacia iraní literalmente invertía el eje de la cuestión, en línea con su histórica retórica, acusando a la Argentina de no querer cooperar y de apoyar al terrorismo. Hasta ese momento, no se observaron hechos ni indicios de peso que permitan sospechar que, solapadamente, ya se había decidido y avanzado en el plan de impunidad. El 27 de octubre de 2010 falleció el ex Presidente Néstor Kirchner. El dato no es anecdótico. Se ha consignado para hacer notar que en un momento casi contemporáneo a este hecho, la causa AMIA dejó de ser una “política de estado” para convertirse en un fusible de ajuste. Una pieza descartable. Y lo grave del caso es que para ello altos funcionarios del gobierno argentino, entre otros partícipes, recurrieron a conductas delictivas. ALBERTO NISMAN FISCAL GENERAL a. 1 ) La cumbre de A lepo: En efecto, el primer indicio conocido y relevante que reflejó la decisión de avanzar con el plan encubridor aquí denunciado se registró tan solo tres meses después de la muerte de Néstor Kirchner. Sucedió en enero de 2011 cuando el canciller argentino se separó de la comitiva presidencial que acompañaba a la Presidente Fernández en una gira por Emiratos Árabes Unidos, Kuwait, Qatar y Turquía, para desviarse a fin de asistir a unas reuniones en la República Árabe Siria (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130911/130913). Concretamente, el 23 de enero de 2011, Timerman arribó a Damasco, donde se reunió con el canciller sirio Walid al-Mohalem. Posteriormente, viajó a Alepo, donde se entrevistó con el Presidente Bashar Al-Assad. Extrañamente, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación no emitió ningún comunicado de prensa que diera cuenta del encuentro de nuestro Canciller con el Presidente sirio Al-Assad y con su Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, a pesar de la trascendencia histórica de semejante acercamiento y de la extraña circunstancia de que se reúnan dos funcionarios de disímil jerarquía, como son un Presidente y un Canciller. (“Argentina y Siria fortalecieron las relaciones”, Télam, 25/01/2011; “Encuentro entre el Presidente de Siria Bashar Al-Assad y el canciller argentino Héctor Timerman”, Prensa Islámica, Fuente:	SANA, 24/01/2011). Sin embargo, un cable público de la agencia oficial de noticias Siria -SANA- informó que, con fecha 23 de enero de 2011, el canciller sirio se había reunido con sus pares de Argentina y de Irán, uno después del otro, y que al día siguiente ambos cancilleres viajaron a la ciudad de Alepo, donde se entrevistaron con el Presidente Al-Assad. Según la citada agencia de noticias, Timerman y Al-Assad abordaron cuestiones relativas al fortalecimiento del intercambio económico y científico entre ambos países, al proceso de paz en Medio Oriente y a las relaciones de los países árabes y latinoamericanos (“Encuentro entre el Presidente de Siria Bashar Al-Assad y el canciller argentino Héctor Timerman”, Prensa Islámica, Fuente: SANA, 24/01/2011). Similar información hizo circular la agencia oficial de noticias argentina TÉLAM (“Argentina y Siria fortalecieron las relaciones”, Télam, 25/1/2011). Distintos elementos probatorios hoy corroboran que el entonces Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Irán, Ali Akbar Salehi participó secretamente de aquella cumbre (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). Según el periodista Gabriel Levinas, quien refirió haber accedido a “fuentes oficiosas de la cancillería de IsraeY’: “...A dicha reunión asistieron, la delegación argentina que acompañó a Timerman, integrada por el Embajador Ahuad y dos funcionarios de inteligencia argentina; de la parte siria, el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores Mohalem y el Presidente Bashar Al Assad. Pero, a diferencia de lo informado por los medios en ese momento, al encuentro también asistieron en representación de Irán, el diplomático Walid Almohalem y el ministro de relaciones exteriores, Ali Akbar Salehi. Pasada la parte introductoria en la que todos participaron, la conversación de poco más de una hora, derivó en un mano a mano entre Salehi y Timerman para tratar el tema principal... ” (Levinas, Gabriel, El Pequeño Timerman, Editorial B, Grupo Zeta, Buenos Aires, 2013, pags. 244 y 281). Por otra parte, Levinas agregó que, según pudo reconstruir de las fuentes israelíes, Timerman habría asegurado: “...Yo estoy aquí bajo precisas órdenes de nuestra presidenta para tratar de encontrar o buscar una solución a la causa AMIA. Los tiempos y humores de nuestro país es un tema que resolveremos internamente...'’’’ (Levinas, Gabriel, op.cit., pags. 246 y 281). ALBERTO NISMA Ministerio Público de la Nación	fiscal general Dos meses después de ocurrido el encuentro, la noticia sobre la reunión de Alepo llegó a la sociedad argentina a través de la prensa. Un artículo publicado por el periodista José Eliaschev informaba acerca de la reunión secreta y de distintas cuestiones relativas a la misma (Pepe Eliaschev, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913). Esta primicia fue profundizada en una segunda nota, días después, en el mismo medio gráfico (Pepe Eliaschev, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). Bajo juramento, el Sr. José Ricardo Eliaschev declaró haber accedido a una copia de un documento secreto redactado por el Ministro Salehi, y dirigido al entonces Presidente iraní Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, que narraba datos y conclusiones de ese encuentro. Fundamentalmente, como se analizará más adelante, Salehi informó a su presidente que el gobierno de Cristina Fernández se encontraba dispuesto a suspender de hecho las investigaciones de los ataques terroristas sufridos en 1992 y en 1994, con tal de avanzar en el terreno comercial (fs. 131.189/131.194 y ver: Pepe Eliaschev, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913 y Pepe Eliaschev, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). Y	como si estos elementos no fueran suficientes, el propio Alí Akbar Salehi reconoció posteriormente que las negociaciones con Timerman principiaron dos años antes de firmar el “Memorando de Entendimiento”, lo que literalmente ubica el inicio de las mismas en enero de 2011, esto es, justamente, para la reunión de Alepo. Así, las declaraciones del canciller iraní corroboran las pruebas aquí señaladas y zanjan toda duda sobre el momento en que se iniciaron las negociaciones (“Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/2/13; “FM: Irán, Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, Irán Daily Brief, 14/2/13; “El Canciller de Irán dice que negoció durante dos años el acuerdo con Argentina”, Clarín, 12/02/2013; “Salehi: Irán Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, IRNA, 12/02/2013). En efecto, la secreta cumbre de Alepo fue llevada a cabo entre los cancilleres argentino e iraní, y el Presidente y el Canciller sirios no solo actuaron como “intermediarios” del acercamiento sino también como “pantalla” para mantener oculta la existencia de aquel contacto. Por todo lo expuesto, la cumbre de Alepo -sobre la base de la evidencia detallada- marca el primer indicio concreto y corroborado que da cuenta de la existencia de una decisión de los más altos funcionarios denunciados del gobierno argentino de abandonar la legítima pretensión de enjuiciar a los acusados iraníes judicialmente imputados por el caso AMIA para posibilitar, entre otros objetivos, intercambios comerciales directos a nivel estatal, aun cuando ello implicara desplegar un plan para encubrir a estos imputados. Según las pruebas halladas hasta el momento, aquella decisión fue comunicada secretamente a las autoridades iraníes por el mismísimo canciller Timerman en Alepo en enero de 2011. a.	2) La predisposición a abandonar el reclamo de justicia por el caso AMIA: Tanto secreto reflejaba la necesidad de esconder algo. Se pretendía ocultar la predisposición de la Dra. Fernández a sacrificar el caso AMIA con tal de acercarse geopolíticamente a Irán y avanzar en relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado con Teherán, tal como lo comunicó el Canciller Timerman a su par iraní. Así surge del documento al que, bajo juramento, declaró hacer accedido el Sr. Eliaschev, y mediante el cual Salehi informó de lo ocurrido en esa cumbre secreta al Presidente Ahmadinejad. En efecto, el testigo Eliaschev declaró que el citado instrumento secreto, redactado por el Ministro Salehi con posterioridad a la reunión de Alepo, ha circulado por las cancillerías de varios países. En este reporte, se informaba que “/a Argentina ya no está más interesada en   ALBERTO NISMa/ FISCAL GENERAL-' resolver aquellos dos atentados, pero que en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones económicas con Irán”. En otras palabras, el gobierno argentino había renunciado a llevar ante la justicia a los funcionarios iraníes imputados y presentaba una expectativa por multiplicar los intercambios comerciales entre ambos países (fs. 131.189/131.194 y ver: Pepe Eliaschev, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913 y Pepe Eliaschev, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011).- A1 declarar ante el suscripto, el testigo aclaró que “la revelación de las reuniones” llegaron a sus manos en idioma inglés, no en farsi, y por constataciones propias, revestían total verosimilitud. Asimismo, precisó que dicho informe contenía las recomendaciones del canciller al presidente de Irán (fs. 131.189/131.194).- También explicó que el citado informe “no se trata de un cable como se lo llama en la jerga periodística”, sino que consiste en “un informe de la cancillería iraní al presidente Ahmadinejad, un típico 'paper' intergubernamental, donde el responsable de las relaciones exteriores del régimen de ese país le sugiere al presidente que en virtud de los elementos de juicio que maneja la cancillería iraní corresponde avanzar en un acuerdo importante con la Argentina por que... están dadas las condiciones para que los argentinos decidan dar vuelta de página...” (fs. 131.189/131.194). Está claro que ningún canciller cometería la imprudencia de formular a su presidente tamaña aseveración de no encontrarse completamente seguro de la información transmitida, lo que constituye una evidencia más que el canciller Timerman efectivamente comunicó a Teherán la predisposición a abandonar la investigación judicial del caso AMIA. De allí, la conclusión iraní -volcada en el documento- sobre la exitosa estrategia de negar las acusaciones en su contra que, a la luz de lo ocurrido en Alepo, rendía sus frutos. En este instrumento, la Cancillería persa concluyó que si las acusaciones judiciales eran dejadas de lado, ambos países podían encarar una nueva etapa vincular y destacaba lo propicio de esta oportunidad, dado el paso del tiempo, la poca relevancia de los casos en la opinión pública actual y, fundamentalmente, la conveniencia del rotundo cambio de postura del gobierno argentino. No obstante ello, los funcionarios iraníes sabían que debían operar asumiendo que el gobierno argentino jamás podría admitir públicamente el retroceso que significaba este acercamiento y, menos aún, la predisposición a dejar de lado el histórico reclamo. Ahora bien, todos los hechos y verificaciones posteriores no hacen más que darle la razón a lo expresado por el Sr. Eliaschev. Las circunstancias constatadas desde entonces ratifican lo expresado por el testigo en relación con el documento al que tuvo acceso. Tan es esto así que, justamente, la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento entre ambos países es la expresión final de lo que anticipaba el “paper” de Salehi. Las más altas autoridades del gobierno argentino estaban dispuestas a dejar de lado su propio reclamo de justicia en beneficio de extranjeros prófugos. El acuerdo conduce a la impunidad de los acusados iraníes. Por un lado, se previo expresamente la incorporación en su letra de mecanismos sumamente intrincados que pudieran tornar inaplicable el convenio, como un modo de garantizar la impunidad. Por otro y ante su eventual implementación, se previo la actuación de la “Comisión de la Verdad”, cuyas conclusiones ya estaban acordadas de antemano y, como surge de la prueba, sería la vía para introducir una nueva hipótesis sobre el atentado, falsa pero verosímil, destinada a desincriminar definitivamente a los imputados iraníes. En suma, las pruebas revelan que existió una iniciativa secreta de ciertas autoridades políticas argentinas destinada a negociar un pacto con Irán para “olvidar” los atentados y reactivar el intercambio comercial a nivel estatal. También ponen al descubierto que esta cuestión no podía ser articulada en forma pública, es decir, los funcionarios argentinos no podían reconocer ni sostener semejante decisión ante la ciudadanía. Teherán lo  ALBERTO NIS  Ministerio Público de la Nación entendía. Había que encontrar, entonces, una forma solapada de poder articular estos intereses. Esto llevaría, eventualmente, a la peculiar redacción del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado a principios de 2013, que no es más que un instrumento y uno de los medios a través de los cuales se lograría la impunidad. a.	3) Indicios de la negociación secreta. A partir de enero de 2011 y hasta fines de septiembre de 2012 los funcionarios argentinos e iraníes negociaron en secreto un acuerdo para destruir las imputaciones de la causa AMIA y brindar impunidad a los prófugos iraníes. No obstante el empeñoso intento para mantener ocultas estas maniobras delictivas, surgió a la luz información y tuvieron lugar episodios que evidenciaron la gestación y el crecimiento del plan criminal, durante ese año y medio de encuentros secretos. Se trata de situaciones de conocimiento público que, examinadas de forma aislada no revelan su verdadero significado, pero que analizadas en conjunto, concatenadamente y a la luz del plan de encubrimiento aquí denunciado cobran su real dimensión, en cuanto demuestran el progreso en el camino del delito así como la cimentación del terreno para hacer público el acercamiento bilateral en el momento más propicio. Cabe aclarar que, si bien no se trata de acciones delictivas per se, estas circunstancias deben ser leídas como manifestaciones que hoy evidencian con claridad el plan delictivo que subrepticiamente se estaba llevando a cabo. Y esa es la única relevancia jurídico-penal de las circunstancias que se mencionarán a continuación. El primer indicio se reveló en la reacción a la noticia publicada por José “Pepe” Eliaschev en el diario Perfil. Cuando, en marzo de 2011, el periodista informó sobre la reunión en Alepo y sobre la decisión de abandonar las acciones judiciales para retomar intercambios comerciales, se generó un importante revuelo en la opinión pública e incluso dentro del gobierno de la Dra. Cristina Fernández. La respuesta no se hizo esperar y estuvo directamente dirigida a desacreditar al portador de la información como una maniobra aviesa de deslegitimación de la versión publicada. En lugar de dar explicaciones que esclarecieran las graves implicancias del trascendido informativo, el Canciller Timerman en persona salió a cuestionar al Sr. Eliaschev, sosteniendo simplemente que los datos publicados eran falsos y tenían por objeto dañar su casi contemporánea visita a Israel. Expresó: “...esa fue una información falsa, fue una operación que se hizo en contra de mis relaciones, o sea de mi viaje a Israel ...Fue el oportunismo de un pseudo-periodista que no vaciló en decir cualquier cosa con tal de ofenderme...'''’ (“Brutal cruce entre Héctor Timerman y Pepe Eliaschev por el pacto con Irán”, Mañana Sylvestre, Radio La Red y Diario Perfil, 20/4/11; el resaltado es propio). A todas luces, se trató de una torpe falacia “ad hominem”, ya que nada dijo acerca de la reunión. Sin embargo, fue la propia contraparte iraní la que terminó por desmentir categóricamente al canciller Timerman. El Ministro Salehi, que había intervenido personalmente en el proceso de negociación, reconoció públicamente, en febrero de 2013, que las negociaciones habían durado dos años. Concretamente expresó: “...nos hemos reunido durante dos años con el canciller Argentino Héctor Timerman''’ (“Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/2/13; “FM: Irán, Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, Irán Daily Brief, 14/2/13; “El Canciller de Irán dice que negoció durante dos años el acuerdo con Argentina”, Clarín, 12/02/2013; “Salehi: Irán Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, IRNA, 12/02/2013). Tal confesión obligó al mendaz canciller argentino a tamizar su primera versión aseverando: “hace dos años que hay un interés de Irán” por tratar el caso. Agregó que no se acordó antes porque “como nunca querían involucrar a la justicia argentina, no había posibilidad de diálogo’’'’ y, finalmente tuvo que reconocer llanamente que “hubo conversaciones, hubo mensajes”. (Piqué, Martín. “Si se lleva adelante el memorándum, se activa la causa y comienza el juicio”, Tiempo Argentino, 17/2/2013). Es decir, no solamente se negó el verdadero motivo de aquel encuentro y se ocultó la negociación que allí principió, sino que cuando estos hechos cobraron estado público a través de la prensa, se decidió cuestionar al periodista responsable de la primicia, como una vía de deslegitimar la información y tornarla inverosímil. Cabe destacar que el testigo Eliaschev declaró bajo juramento de ley haber tenido ante su vista la copia del citado documento, explicando las circunstancias en las que accedió al mismo. Estas críticas a la prensa marcaron el interés por mantener estas negociaciones en la oscuridad. Y no sería la única vez que el Canciller, para desacreditar fuentes en el marco de este plan criminal, en lugar de controvertir los hechos narrados, recurrió al cuestionamiento de quienes comunicaron las circunstancias que el ministro prefería ocultar, como ocurrió con las declaraciones del ex Vice Canciller Roberto García Moritán. Lógicamente el funcionario argentino no podía admitir públicamente que se había renunciado al reclamo de justicia por el caso AMIA para habilitar un acercamiento comercial con la República Islámica de Irán. El segundo indicio tuvo lugar en la víspera del 17° aniversario del atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, cuando la prensa persa informó sobre un comunicado de la cancillería de ese país, fechado en 16 de julio de 2011,	mediante el cual manifestó estar “dispuesta a un diálogo constructivo'1'' y “a cooperar con el gobierno Argentino para que se haga toda la luz en el marco de la ley y del respeto mutuo para ayudar a evitar que la investigación judicial continúe por un camino errado”. Según los trascendidos, el gobierno iraní había expresado su indignación “por el hecho de que la búsqueda de la verdad sobre la acción criminal se haya convertido en objeto de conjuras y juegos políticos” destinado a implicar a Irán, “para desviar el proceso judicial de su camino e impedir que los verdaderos responsables de este crimen caigan en manos de la justicia”. Agregó que “La Cancillería de Irán expresa también su malestar por la continuación de estos hechos por quienes han venido actuando en el Poder Judicial argentino desde aquella época”. (“Irán, dispuesto a cooperar con Argentina por atentado contra AMIA de 1994”, El Comunal, 16/07/2011; “Irán to cooperate over Argentina Jewish Centre bomb”, BBC News, 17/07/11; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in AMIA bombing probe”, Tehran Times, 18/07/2011; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in 1994 bombing inquiry”, BBC News, 18/7/11; “Irán promete ayuda para esclarecer el caso AMIA”, La Nación, 17/07/11; Eliaschev, Pepe. “Las condiciones que pone Irán para dialogar”, Perfil, 23/7/11).- Cabe destacar que, en aquel momento, el ofrecimiento de cooperación apareció, al menos para la sociedad argentina, totalmente fuera de contexto. De un día para el otro Irán se decía dispuesto a cooperar sin motivo o razón alguna que justifique dicho paso. Hoy se comprende que se trataba de un gesto expresado en el marco de las negociaciones que se estaban llevando a cabo en forma secreta. En respuesta a ello, el 17 de julio, la cancillería argentina emitió un comunicado por el que hacía saber que había tomado conocimiento, a través de la prensa, del anuncio de la cancillería iraní y que esperaba “recibir la comunicación oficial de su par irán?"" en relación con el ofrecimiento de cooperación. El comunicado argentino agregó que “de confirmarse lo publicado significaría un avance inédito y muy positivo de las autoridades de la República Islámica de Irán en la causa AMIA”. Y finalizaba diciendo “La Argentina ratifica que la ley y la justicia son el único camino que deben seguir las sociedades y sus gobiernos para combatir el terrorismo internacional” (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N°336/l 1 “Respuesta del gobierno argentino ante el anuncio de cooperación del gobierno iraní en la causa AMIA”, 17/7/11; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in AMIA bombing probe”, Tehran Times, 18/07/2011; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in 1994 bombing inquiry”, BBC News, 18/7/11; “AMIA: promesa iraní para el aniversario”, Ámbito Financiero, 18/7/11).   Ministerio Público de la Nación Así, si bien las autoridades argentinas mantuvieron cierto ambiguo respaldo oficial a la justicia nacional como vía obligada de tratamiento de esta cuestión, nada respondieron, a contramano de lo que venía ocurriendo hasta entonces, a las afirmaciones iraníes que sugerían que las conclusiones judiciales argentinas estaban sesgadas por intereses políticos, que constituían un camino equivocado y que la ayuda prometida por Irán tenía por objeto modificar esa trayectoria y reencausar la investigación hacia otra hipótesis que tuviera otros imputados, desincriminando a Irán del caso. En otras palabras, Irán repetía su retórica de siempre. No estaba ofreciendo allanarse a los pedidos de cooperación emanados de la justicia nacional ni mucho menos a detener a los prófugos que ha mantenido resguardados en su territorio, sino que se ofrecía a colaborar en el redireccionamiento de la investigación hacia otra hipótesis, en la que - obviamente- Irán no estuviera involucrado. La respuesta del gobierno argentino no tomó razón de esta circunstancia como así tampoco de las palabras de descrédito hacia la justicia nacional y nada objetó al respecto. Al contrario, pareció apoyarlas de manera inédita en ese entonces. De hecho, a pesar de la elocuente descalificación a la actuación de la justicia argentina, y lejos de exigir -como otrora lo hiciera la cancillería de nuestro país ante este tipo de expresiones- rectificación por la implicancia de lo dicho, el Canciller Timerman manifestó que la propuesta “sería un avance inédito y muy positivo” (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N°336/ll, 17/07/2011). Hoy queda evidenciado que se estaba preparando el terreno para el encubrimiento de un crimen de lesa humanidad. Y	corresponde agregar aquí una reflexión: ¿qué sucedió con aquel ofrecimiento de cooperación de Irán? Previsiblemente, nada. Quedó simplemente en palabras vacías, como siempre ha ocurrido con Irán en esta causa. Debe hacerse notar, además, que a propósito de aquella oferta iraní, la Unidad Fiscal que el suscripto dirige reenvió dos nuevos exhortos a la República Islámica de Irán consignando en su texto el ofrecimiento de colaboración de las autoridades iraníes como una manera de capitalizar en beneficio de la investigación la declamada predisposición a cooperar. Nunca los respondieron (fs. 1179 del Legajo 415 y fs. 6416 del Legajo 392). Lamentablemente, ahora se constata que todo se trató de una puesta en escena para seguir avanzando con el plan de impunidad que en aquellos tiempos se gestaba. El tercer indicio ocurrió dos meses más tarde, en ocasión de la apertura de la 66° Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, el 22 septiembre del año 2011. Por primera vez desde 2009, la Sra. Presidente instruyó al entonces Embajador argentino ante dicha organización, Jorge Argüello, para que permanezca en su asiento mientras pronunciaba su discurso el, en aquel tiempo, Presidente de la República Islámica, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Ello, en contraste con la decisión sostenida por la mandataria en los años previos, de retirar a la delegación argentina del piso y no presenciar los discursos de Ahmadinejad (“La AMIA reclamó que la delegación argentina abandone la ONU cuando hable el presidente de Irán”, La Prensa, 11/09/2012; Mindez, Leonardo, “AMIA: Con otro gesto oficial se confirmó el giro ante Irán”, Clarín, 23/09/2011; Levinas, Gabriel, op.cit., pags. 173, 189, 208, 20 y 279). Semejante signo comunicacional resulta menos críptico si se lo contextualiza en el marco de las negociaciones que estaban manteniendo secretamente ambos países. Como ya se sostuvo, no se cuestiona la decisión política de la Sra. Presidente de ordenar al embajador argentino ante la ONU que permanezca en su asiento escuchando el discurso del primer mandatario iraní. Simplemente, es mencionado en este punto por tratarse de un indicio importante de la existencia de las negociaciones entonces secretas. El cuarto indicio tuvo lugar, ya en el mes de septiembre de 2012, cuando -por primera vez en años- Presidencia de la Nación decidió no   Ministerio Público de la Nación invitar a formar parte de la comitiva argentina que viajó a la 67a Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas a ninguno de los dirigentes comunitarios de las instituciones judías locales. Así lo reconoció uno de ellos: “...el último año no hemos sido invitados, lamentablemente. Y es cuando surge justamente la propuesta de esta mesa de diálogo por parte de la Presidenta de la Nación...” (Borger, Guillermo. Versión taquigráfica del plenario de comisiones en el Honorable Senado de la Nación del 13 de febrero de 2013). Este dato resulta sumamente llamativo si se tiene en cuenta que - justamente- en esa oportunidad, la Dra. Fernández anunció oficialmente su decisión de “iniciar” un diálogo con Irán en torno al caso AMIA. La existencia de negociaciones y acuerdos previos con Irán y el conocimiento anticipado del anuncio que se haría, debieron motivar la decisión de no sumar a la dirigencia comunitaria judía a la comitiva. Esto demuestra, como las demás pruebas lo corroboran, que la Sra. Presidente mintió al sostener que en ese momento se iniciaban las negociaciones. No sería la única mentira ni la más grave. Es decir, durante el transcurso de las negociaciones secretas, de enero de 2011 a septiembre de 2012, existieron señales de cambio que, hoy se entiende, respondían al acercamiento entre funcionarios de ambos países y -fundamentalmente- al plan criminal que se había gestado, cuyo objetivo final era brindar impunidad a los acusados prófugos y vaciar de contenido la imputación del suscripto y del Sr. Juez que obtuvo un fuerte y decisivo respaldo internacional en las sucesivas votaciones de Interpol. En síntesis, pese a que las autoridades del gobierno argentino involucradas en el encubrimiento de los imputados iraníes, con toda lógica, intentaron mantener bajo estricto secreto las negociaciones que estaban llevando adelante con los funcionarios persas, fueron surgiendo a la luz varios indicios que claramente se erigieron en señales de la existencia de dichas tratativas. En efecto, trascendió a la prensa la reunión secreta que Héctor Timerman mantuvo en Alepo y el canciller argentino cuestionó duramente al periodista que difundió la noticia. De un día para el otro y sin justificativo alguno, en julio de 2011, Irán se declaró dispuesto a negociar en relación al atentado. El gobierno argentino presenciaba por intermedio de su embajador, después de dos años, el discurso del Presidente Ahmadinejad ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas. La Presidente Fernández no invitó a las instituciones comunitarias judías, como había sido su costumbre, a formar parte de la comitiva que la acompañó a la siguiente reunión anual de las Naciones Unidas y justamente, en esa oportunidad, anunció una negociación con la República Islámica de Irán en relación al ataque terrorista del 18 de julio de 1994. ¿Pueden todos estos signos ser tomados simplemente como frutos de la casualidad? El sentido común indica que no, pero son las pruebas a las que se ha accedido las que confirman que todos estos gestos se debieron al acercamiento secreto que había ocurrido entre las partes y cuyo objetivo final fue brindar impunidad a los acusados iraníes prófugos. a.	4) Negociación Pública. El 25 de septiembre de 2012, la Sra. Presidente de la Nación, Cristina Fernández, anunció ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas que había instruido a su canciller Héctor Timerman, para que inicie un proceso de negociación con Irán en torno al caso AMIA. Oficialmente se comunicó que esta decisión respondía a un pedido articulado por Irán siete días antes de la apertura del Debate General de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, Comunicado de Prensa N°302, 18/09/2012). Sin embargo, como ya se probó, los elementos aquí obtenidos demuestran que eso fue solo una puesta en escena, dado que las partes estaban negociando desde hacía más de un año. Ello se desprende de lo analizado en los puntos anteriores. Así, “...Cristina y su canciller solo estaban oficializando un hecho consumado...” (Ver: Levinas, Gabriel, op cit, pag. 237). Ello también se sustenta tanto en lo testificado por el Sr. Eliaschev como en lo declarado públicamente por el propio Canciller Salehi, que demuestra que el “inicio” de las negociaciones anunciado por la Dra. Fernández y su Canciller en septiembre de 2012 fue sencillamente falso (“Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/2/13; “FM: Irán, Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, Irán Daily Brief, 14/2/13; “El Canciller de Irán dice que negoció durante dos años el acuerdo con Argentina”, Clarín, 12/02/2013; “Salehi: Irán Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case”, IRNA, 12/02/2013; fs. 131.189/131.194; Pepe Eliaschev, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Pepe Eliaschev, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011; Eliaschev, Pepe. “Las condiciones que pone Irán para dialogar”, Perfil, 23/7/11). Por otra parte, para el diario The Tehran Times, la negociación entre Argentina e Irán había comenzado incluso un tiempo antes que la cumbre de Alepo, a mediados de 2010, a partir de una serie de reuniones secretas entre funcionarios de ambos gobiernos “...parapreparar el terreno para la firma del memorándum de entendimiento...” (Soroush, M. “Irán and Argentina deal a serious blow to zionists”, Tehran Times, 23/02/2013; Levinas, Gabriel, op cit, pag. 238; “La prensa iraní afirma que la negociación con Argentina empezó en 2010”, La Nación, 24/02/2013); circunstancia que también mencionó el Sr. Eliaschev en sus notas periodísticas (Pepe Eliaschev, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011). Ahora bien, lo cierto fue que el 25 de septiembre de 2012 en Naciones Unidas, la Dra. Fernández decidió oficializar las negociaciones con la República Islámica de Irán. Naturalmente, nada dijo del año y medio de tratativas secretas que tuvieron lugar entre enero de 2011 y septiembre de 2012. Lo que sí aseveró a las víctimas y a los familiares de las víctimas fue: “tengan la certeza de que esta Presidenta no va a tomar ninguna resolución respecto de ninguna propuesta que le sea formulada, sin consultar PREVIAMENTE con quienes han sido las víctimas directas de esto. Y, al mismo tiempo también, con las fuerzas políticas con representación parlamentaria en mi país, porque esto no lo puede decidir una sola fuerza política...” (Discurso de Cristina Fernández ante la 67a Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, de fecha 25 de septiembre de 2012,	el resaltado es propio). Sin embargo y pese a haberse comprometido públicamente a consultarlos previo a tomar cualquier resolución, nada de eso ocurrió y luego de tres reuniones con los funcionarios iraníes en Suiza, con fecha 27 de enero de 2013, se dio a conocer en Adís Abeba, Reino de Etiopía, la suscripción del “Memorándum de Entendimiento entre el Gobierno de la República Argentina y el Gobierno de la República Islámica de Irán sobre los temas vinculados al ataque terrorista a la sede de la AMIA en Buenos Aires el 18 de julio de 1994” (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información para la Prensa N° 011/13, 27/01/2013). La firma del acuerdo dejó en evidencia que la Sra. Presidente faltó a su palabra. Más adelante se verá que esta promesa incumplida no es solo moralmente reprochable -lo cual no es relevante en términos judiciales-, sino que -y esto sí importa- ha sido una acción especialmente destinada a contribuir con el avance del plan delictivo denunciado. La Sra. Presidente comunicó este acuerdo a través de su cuenta oficial de “Twitter”, un día domingo, coincidente con el “Día Internacional de Conmemoración en Memoria de las Víctimas del Holocausto”. Y al hacerlo, lo calificó de un hecho “histórico” (Mensajes de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 de horas: 10:26 a 10:32). En ese sentido, las autoridades de la AMIA hablaron de un “memorando inconsulto” y señalaron que: “la propuesta aparece firmada, un hecho del que no hemos sido informados”, “este memorando nos sorprende a toda la ciudadanía el pasado 27 de enero, jamás fue consultado, ni siquiera comentado’1'1 (Borger, Guillermo en: “La AMIA  Al BERTO MISM TiSCAL GENERAL advirtió un momento difícil, tras el acuerdo entre Argentina e Irán”, La Nación, 3/2/2013; “Presidente de la AMIA prometió no bajar los brazos y se comprometió a evitar que la causa por el atentado causa en la nulidad”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 4/3/2013). Por su parte, los representantes de la DAIA afirmaron haber tomado conocimiento del acuerdo en el mismo momento que el resto de la opinión	pública y	aclararon que	la institución	no fue	consultada previamente ni participó de la redacción del documento (Schlosser, Julio en: “LA DAIA reconoció que hay un resquemor en la comunidad judía por el acuerdo que la Argentina firmó con Irán”, Itongadol, 4/2/2013). Volviendo al mes de septiembre de 2012 y luego del anuncio presidencial ante Naciones Unidas, la Cancillería Argentina y el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores iraní emitieron un comunicado conjunto que - como se verá- contribuyó a amplificar la mentira presidencial. En ese informe,	ambos ministerios decían	haberse comprometido	a explorar mecanismos legales que no estuvieran en contradicción con los sistemas legales de Argentina e Irán (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información para la Prensa 313/12, 27/09/2012). Es menester adelantar aquí que el resultado de los encuentros diplomáticos no respetó precisamente el sistema legal argentino. Todo lo contrario, en consonancia con lo dictaminado oportunamente por la Unidad Fiscal a mi cargo, el Memorando de Entendimiento vulneró la Constitución Nacional	y normas	internacionales	de Derechos	Humanos de igual jerarquía.	Ello fue	sostenido en el	fallo de la	Cámara	Criminal y Correccional Federal de esta ciudad, que declaró la inconstitucionalidad del pacto y de su ley aprobatoria (CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 “AMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N°6- Secretaría N°ll). Es decir, en contraposición a lo anunciado, el canciller Timerman suscribió un instrumento jurídico en flagrante contradicción con el orden jurídico local. Aclarado ello, cabe agregar que a aquel primer comunicado de prensa le siguieron otros, en los cuales la Cancillería daba cuenta de breves encuentros entre ambas partes, pero nada decía en concreto sobre el contenido del diálogo ni sobre el alcance de las cuestiones negociadas (Comunicados de Prensa del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de fecha 27/9/12 - N°313/12; 29/10/12 -N°353/12-; 31/10/12 - N°360/12-; 1/12/12 - N°391/12; 7/1/13 - N°002/13-). Hasta el día de hoy, las autoridades argentinas no han brindado la más mínima información sobre lo negociado en esos encuentros. Incluso, ante el pedido articulado por el suscripto a solicitud de las instituciones querellantes AMIA (Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina) y DAIA (Delegación de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentina), requiriendo información sobre los encuentros con Teherán, la cartera de Timerman hizo saber “que tratándose de un proceso de negociación diplomática entre Estados las partes han acordado mantener reserva de su contenido mientras dure el mismo” (oficio de fecha 5 de noviembre de 2012 glosado a fs. 132.805 y Nota N°2194 fechada en 8 de noviembre de 2012 de la Carpeta DIAJU N°7102/11, Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto). En realidad, valiéndose de las prerrogativas de secreto propias de la actividad diplomática, ocultándose detrás de la confidencialidad que se le permite a ciertos encuentros, el Canciller Timerman mantuvo en reserva sus tratativas porque no estaba en condiciones de hacerlas públicas. Se estaba negociando un encubrimiento y la publicidad y el control ciudadano era el mayor enemigo. Es un caso más de utilización dual de las funciones diplomáticas para ocultar acciones delictivas destinadas a encubrir al terrorismo. No es nuevo para Teherán ni, evidentemente, para los encubridores en esta maniobra delictiva. En síntesis, tal como lo revelan los hechos aquí enunciados, las tratativas sobre este tema fueron iniciadas en el mayor de los secretos, ocultas detrás de intermediarios y reuniones “pantalla”, y así se mantuvieron durante el siguiente año y medio, hasta que se anunció públicamente el “inicio” del diálogo, cuyo contenido y alcance ha permanecido en reserva. Para impedir que trasciendan, primero la existencia de los contactos y después, su contenido, se recurrió a la negación de los hechos, a su tergiversación y hasta se llegó a cuestionar y desacreditar a las fuentes que brindaban información sobre el tema, como estrategia para impedir -de la forma que fuere necesaria- la verificación de estas circunstancias, sin expedirse sobre los cuestionamientos realizados. Este fue el inicio del plan criminal. Luego se fue perdiendo todo formalismo, si se quiere, para adentrarse en una actividad y conjunto de hechos delictivos de los que la historia judicial argentina no debe registrar muchos antecedentes. Como se verá, son la clara muestra de una impunidad y un uso arbitrario y delictivo del poder estatal pocas veces visto. a)	Los motivos del encubrimiento. Aun cuando la configuración del delito de encubrimiento no exija normativamente la acreditación de los intereses que pudieron haber motivado al sujeto activo a desplegar la conducta típica, dada la sofisticación que reviste este caso, es sumamente ilustrativo explayarse, según los indicios y elementos probatorios obtenidos, sobre aspectos de esta cuestión ya que, a criterio del suscripto, contribuyen a comprender acabadamente el plan criminal aquí denunciado. Quedó ya acreditado que las autoridades argentinas decidieron que resultaba conveniente restablecer relaciones bilaterales plenas con la República Islámica de Irán. Se reitera que sobre ese punto, nada hay para discutir pues, compartida o no, dicha decisión es propia del Poder Ejecutivo y no es materia judiciable. Por otra parte, cabe aclarar que las razones de índole comercial que motivaron a las autoridades argentinas y demás partícipes, exaltadas por la severa crisis energética, se desprenden de los elementos con que se cuenta y por ello, se las considera determinantes de las conductas que se denuncian, pero no únicas. También se cuenta con elementos probatorios que demuestran que existieron razones de índole geopolítica que motivaron el acercamiento con Teherán. Según estas pruebas, se entendió que el actual escenario mundial favorecía la proximidad con Irán e imponía la necesidad de aniquilar la causa AMIA. Por lo demás, no se puede descartar que hayan existido otros motivos alternativos y complementarios a los aquí constatados, que hayan contribuido también a impulsar la decisión y las maniobras de encubrimiento aquí expuestas. En ese caso, la determinación de estas razones concurrentes podrá ser abordada en la investigación aquí propiciada. Ahora bien, la Dra. Cristina Fernández fue lo suficientemente sagaz para advertir, a priori, que esa decisión jamás sería tolerada pacíficamente por la opinión pública argentina debido al pronunciamiento de la justicia nacional sobre la responsabilidad de funcionarios iraníes en el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA. Es decir, acercarse y negociar con el gobierno de un país cuyos funcionarios y ex funcionarios están acusados de participar del más grave atentado perpetrado en territorio nacional, generaría una fuerte polémica si no se abordaba la cuestión pendiente en torno a la causa AMIA antes del inicio de las tratativas comerciales. Presente ello, el modo del que se valió la Sra. Presidente para zanjar esta cuestión espinosa resulta verdaderamente inexplicable y, lo que es central, delictivo. Decidió, lisa y llanamente, obviar el problema. Optó entonces por desconocer lo decidido por la justicia y ordenar la ejecución de un plan de encubrimiento que permita liberar a los prófugos iraníes de toda sospecha, eximiéndolos de responsabilidad penal y garantizándoles impunidad para el futuro. Sin acusación que entorpezca las relaciones, no habría objeciones para avanzar en el terreno comercial a nivel estatal. Existía, entonces, la necesidad de “lavarle la cara” a Irán. Con esta idea en mente, se negoció secretamente un acuerdo de impunidad, aceptando dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol de los cinco imputados iraníes y -como se verá- construyendo, clandestinamente, una hipótesis alternativa que señalara nuevos y falsos acusados para desincriminar a los verdaderos culpables. En ese camino, se realizaron negociaciones secretas y luego públicas, se suscribió el Memorando de Entendimiento, se impulsó velozmente su aprobación en el Congreso Nacional; se mintió a familiares y víctimas del atentado prometiéndoles que serían consultados sobre las propuestas esgrimidas en la negociación; se destinaron agentes del servicio de inteligencia de la Presidencia de la Nación para que “construyan” una falsa pero verosímil hipótesis alternativa a la obtenida judicialmente y basada en las pruebas del caso, recurriendo a un ex fiscal de la causa para que aporte su conocimiento; se estableció un canal de comunicación paralelo con Teherán; se articuló una campaña política y mediática para desacreditar las imputaciones judiciales y se montaron verdaderas actuaciones para disimular el plan criminal. En síntesis, se realizaron un sinfín de conductas que, analizadas globalmente, reflejan tanto el dolo directo de los partícipes de esta maniobra delictiva como la minuciosidad con que el encubrimiento estuvo pensado y ejecutado. a.	1) Un encubrimiento peculiar Las pruebas acumuladas permiten concluir que el acercamiento que llevó a la suscripción del memorando de entendimiento como medio para lograr impunidad, como así también su constante impulso, no ha sido motorizado por Irán, sino que fueron las mencionadas autoridades argentinas las que han venido ejecutando, principalmente, este plan criminal. Esto, como ya se señaló, marca una peculiaridad en la perpetración del delito, dado que, aunque parezca irracional, este encubrimiento ha sido impulsado por el interés del encubridor, más que por el de los sujetos encubiertos. No fueron las autoridades ni los prófugos iraníes quienes cruzaron océanos y desiertos para llegar a la septentrional Alepo en Siria a negociar secretamente un pacto, ofreciendo impunidad, como se probará seguidamente. Por su parte, los hechos revelan que a las autoridades iraníes solo les ha importado lograr el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que pesan sobre cinco de sus nacionales, personas de gran relevancia de la vida política iraní. Habían acusado recibo de la afrenta sufrida cuando el ex Ministro de Defensa, Ahmad Vahidi, debió abandonar territorio boliviano ante la presión generada por la vigencia de la notificación roja en su contra (“Bolivia echó a Ministro de Defensa iraní acusado por atentado en la Argentina”, Infobae.com, 31/5/2011; “Evo expulsó a un funcionario iraní”, Página 12, 1/6/2011; “Bolivia pide disculpas a la Argentina y expulsa a Ministro de Defensa iraní”, El mundo, 1/6/2011). Episodios como estos han obligado al régimen a dotar de inmunidad diplomática a cada uno de los prófugos en cada ocasión en que viajan al exterior. De hecho, en mayo de este año, representantes de la República de Corea consultaron sobre las implicancias de una posible invitación al imputado Mohsen Rezai para que visite dicho país, por lo que se dispuso comunicar inmediatamente a Interpol que, en caso de concretarse la visita, se haga efectiva la orden de captura internacional, con notificación roja, que pesa sobre el nombrado (Oficio del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto del 9/05/2014, Nota n°5572/14; Oficio al Jefe del Departamento Interpol de la Policía Federal Argentina fechado en 12/5/2014). Esto demuestra que, como se dijo, si bien las notificaciones rojas no han conseguido -por el momento- la detención de los imputados, claramente los afectan, dado que continúan siendo un obstáculo que dificulta su movilidad transnacional. Por lo demás, el interés iraní en torno a la ratificación del acuerdo desapareció al no caer las notificaciones rojas, como se había convenido. Nótese que con fecha 10 de marzo de 2013, el Memorando de Entendimiento fue elevado al Parlamento de Irán para su convalidación. Una semana después, el día 15 de marzo, Interpol garantizó la estabilidad de las notificaciones rojas. Al día siguiente, el Canciller Salehi expresó públicamente su disconformidad con lo resuelto por la Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal, al aclarar que, conforme lo convenido, _juÁ ALBERTO NISMAjfi FISCAL GENERAL con la sola firma del acuerdo, Interpol debía hacer cesar las notificaciones rojas. La consecuencia de dicho revés desalentador para Irán fue que el tratado nunca recibió tratamiento parlamentario y pareció quedar fuera de la agenda legislativa iraní. (Pagni, Carlos, “El kirchnerismo, en el peor de los mundos”, La Nación 30/5/13; “El memorandún con Argentina llega al parlamento iraní”, Europa Press, 11/3/2013; Kollmann, Raúl “Con novedades semana a semana”, Página 12, 24/3/13; Nota N°LA/35678-47- 3.1 EGI/tsa, Consejería jurídica, Secretaría General, Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal, 15/3/2013; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado N°044/13 del 15/03/2013; IRNA, “Salehi, Irán y Argentina trabajan conjuntamente para resolver las acusaciones sobre la AMIA”, 18/3/2013; “Irán asegura que el acuerdo con Argentina incluye retirar las “notas rojas” de Interpol”, La Nación, 18/3/2013). Esto demuestra la relevancia que la cuestión de las notificaciones rojas tenía para la parte iraní, lo cual también quedó evidenciado en las palabras del Ministro Salehi, negociador del acuerdo, que dio cuenta de la existencia de acuerdos secretos entre ambos países sobre ese tema, que fueron escondidos y negados por las autoridades argentinas, y cuyo cumplimiento quedó trunco -como lo demuestra la prueba- por la intermediación de Interpol. Ahora bien y volviendo a la peculiaridad de este encubrimiento, cabe destacar que las evidencias revelan una profunda disparidad de intereses entre las autoridades argentinas e iraníes, que también quedó expuesta en las siguientes circunstancias: 1)	El viaje del canciller Héctor Timerman a Alepo, para iniciar secretamente las negociaciones, ofreciendo lo que Teherán siempre pidió: el abandono de las acusaciones contra sus ciudadanos por el mayor hecho de terrorismo sufrido en territorio argentino (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011; Levinas, Gabriel, op. cit., pags. 244, 246 y 281). 2)	El absoluto silencio del gobierno argentino, durante el período de negociaciones públicas y aun luego de haberse firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, frente a las agraviantes declaraciones de funcionarios iraníes, tendientes a descalificar la investigación judicial argentina y/o a las autoridades judiciales que han intervenido en la misma (“Irán volvió a rechazar todas las acusaciones por el atentado a la AMIA”, La Nación, 30/10/2012; Paraszczuk, Joanna, “Irán ready to identify AMIA bombing perpetrators”, Jerusalem Post, 30/10/12; Kollmann, Raúl: “Irán volvió a negar su culpabilidad”, Página 12, 31/10/12; “Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/02/2013; “Irán rechazó las acusaciones del fiscal Alberto Nisman al considerarlo sionista”, La Nación, 3/6/20113; “El ministerio exteriores de Irán: No le damos importancia a las declaraciones de Nisman”, IRNA, 5/6/2013; Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, “Irán rechazó, otra vez, su participación en la AMIA”, Clarín, 19/06/2013; “Irán volvió a criticar al sionismo”, La Nación, 19/06/2013; “Para Irán, la causa AMIA causó amargura en las relaciones entre Irán y Argentina”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 16/07/2013). 3)	La sobreactuación elogiosa del canciller argentino ante un planteo del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores iraní para “colaborar” con la causa, en Julio de 2011, que, como siempre ocurrió con Irán en esta causa, nunca se concretó (“Irán, dispuesto a cooperar con Argentina por atentado contra AMIA de 1994”, El Comunal, 16/07/2011; “Irán to cooperate over Argentina Jewish Centre bomb”, BBC News, 17/07/11; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in AMIA bombing probe”, Tehran Times, 18/07/2011; “Argentina welcomes Irán offer in 1994 bombing inquiry”, BBC News, 18/7/11; “Irán promete ayuda para esclarecer el caso AMIA”, La Nación, 17/07/11; Eliaschev, Pepe. “Las condiciones que pone Irán para dialogar”, Perfil, 23/7/11; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N°336/l 1 “Respuesta del gobierno argentino ante el anuncio de cooperación del gobierno iraní en la causa AMIA”, 17/7/11; “AMIA: promesa iraní para el aniversario”, Ambito Financiero, 18/7/11). ALBERTO MIS FISCAL GENEfi^ 4)	La presencia de la legación argentina en la sala de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas durante los discursos del mandatario persa, en septiembre de 2011 y de 2012 (“La AMIA reclamó que la delegación argentina abandone la ONU cuando hable el presidente de Irán”, La Prensa, 11/09/2012; Mindez, Leonardo, “AMIA: Con otro gesto oficial se confirmó el giro ante Irán”, Clarín, 23/09/2011; Levinas, Gabriel, op.cit., pags. 173, 189, 208, 20 y 279). 5)	La rápida ratificación del acuerdo por parte del Congreso Argentino, en contraposición con la aún pendiente aprobación iraní (Sofía Guterman, “Se está haciendo todo lo posible para que Irán salga triunfante de esto”, Radio JAI, 14/02/2013; “Sobre el cruce en el debate por el memorándum: Lo de ayer fue miserable”, La Razón, 14/02/2013; “Familiares de las víctimas del atentado a la AMIA piden participar en el plenario de Diputados”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 22/02/2013; Pagni, Carlos, “El kirchnerismo, en el peor de los mundos”, La Nación 30/5/13; “El memorandún con Argentina llega al parlamento iraní”, Europa Press, 11/3/2013; Kollmann, Raúl “Con novedades semana a semana”, Página 12, 24/3/13). 6)	los posteriores reclamos y propuestas de la Sra. Presidente y del Sr. Canciller, ante la falta de notificación fehaciente de ratificación interna del acuerdo por parte de Irán, además de los públicos pedidos para acelerar la conformación de la comisión creada en el acuerdo y fijar la fecha de las audiencias previstas en el mismo. (“Timerman estimó que en el próximo mes y medio el parlamento iraní aprobará el acuerdo por la AMIA”, Télam, 18/4/13; “Cuánto más tarde Irán en aprobar el memorando, más dudas va a generar”, Ámbito Financiero, 18/4/13; “Ultimátum oficial a Irán: Espero que en un mes aprueben el memorándum”, Infobae, 18/04/2013; “Reclaman a Irán el aval al acuerdo”, Clarín, 19/04/2013; “Timerman confía en que Irán firmará el pacto en un mes”, La Gaceta, 19/04/2013; Discurso de Cristina Fernández, 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2013; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°279/13, Declaración de prensa leída por el Canciller Timerman en Casa Rosada, 24 de noviembre de 2013; Dinatale, Martín, “La negociación con Irán, empantanada por la lista de Interpol”, La Nación, 08/12/2013). 7)	Los aprestos a nivel ministerial para iniciar el intercambio comercial de “petróleo por granos”, deseado y promovido por las autoridades argentinas, ni bien Irán apruebe el acuerdo (Comunicaciones del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l 009-2013-05-20- 133130-8, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-111124-8, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 114842-2, CD 31; Archivo B-l009-2013-05-20- 140034-12, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-143508-24, CD 31; Archivo B-l009-2013-05-20-161759-6, CD 31; del 21/05/2013 abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo 2542, CD 32 y del 28/05/2013, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). 8)	La “puesta en escena” de la diplomacia argentina, perpetrada en septiembre de 2013, intentando mostrar avances específicos en la relación con Irán (ver punto V.b.2). 9)	La construcción de una hipótesis falsa con nuevos autores y pruebas fraudulentas, que desplace a la actual acusación judicial, con el objeto de desinvicular definitivamente a los imputados iraníes (Comunicación del 27/1/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266; Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l 009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43; Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	12-18-183332-8, CD 226; Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-02-14-164341-10, CD 284). En suma, las circunstancias acreditadas a lo largo de toda esta presentación y aquí sucintamente enumeradas, demuestran a las claras que, en este caso, los encubridores se han mostrado mucho más interesados que los encubiertos en avanzar hacia los pasos finales del plan y esto, hoy ya se sabe, guarda relación directa con el hecho de que ha sido el interés de restablecer un comercio de Estado a Estado y de posicionarse geopolíticamente cerca de Teherán, conforme lo decidieron las autoridades Ministerio Público de la Nación AL®,fiTiro NISM FISCAL GENERA1 argentinas aquí involucradas, lo que motivó tanto el acercamiento a negociar como la definición y consecución del plan encubridor. Las conversaciones interceptadas entre los reales negociadores de ambos estados así lo acreditan. a.	2) Pruebas del interés por restablecer relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado Existen numerosas evidencias que demuestran que un fuerte interés subyacente a las probadas acciones criminales direccionadas a garantizar impunidad era, como ya se anunció; restablecer relaciones comerciales al nivel de los estados, como una salida a la grave crisis energética nacional. De hecho, las intervenciones telefónicas dispuestas judicialmente han permitido conocer y probar estas circunstancias, dado que estos temas fueron tratados a través de los canales paralelos de comunicación y negociación establecidos con Teherán, para avanzar con el plan encubridor. Primero. Antes de la firma del acuerdo, cuando nada se sabía de lo que se estaba negociando en Suiza, Fernando Esteche, partícipe de esta maniobra, líder del grupo “Quebracho”, histórico defensor del régimen iraní y allegado a funcionarios del gobierno nacional, aseveró: “...los tipos quieren restablecer relaciones ...que lo van a hacer... multidimensionalmente eso. A nivel gobierno, te digo, a nivel Estado...lo que tiene que ver con establecer relaciones entre los dos Estados...” (Comunicación del 18/12/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Los partícipes del plan estaban al tanto de los intereses subyacentes al acuerdo. Además se evidencia que personajes locales histórica y fuertemente ligados a la República Islámica de Irán, y que, al mismo tiempo, poseen estrechos vínculos con funcionarios del gobierno nacional, ya conocían los intereses del acuerdo que viabiliza la impunidad de los prófugos iraníes. Segundo. Un contacto de Jorge Khalil, el empresario iraní Heshmatollah Rahnema, también estaba al tanto del interés del gobierno argentino por comerciar con Irán. Por dicha razón, se comunicó con Khalil para hacerle saber de su gestión ante la Cámara de Comercio de Teherán, la cual tenía intención de reunirse en Irán con representantes diplomáticos argentinos, para abrir el camino a todas las empresas iraníes, para que éstas comiencen a negociar con Argentina. Este pedido de acercamiento y reunión por parte de grupos económicos iraníes hubiera sido impensado antes del acuerdo por AMIA. Nada tiene de malo el comercio, muy por el contrario, pero resulta delictivo que para viabilizarlo se desarticulen ilegalmente las acusaciones judiciales y se dote de impunidad a los prófugos iraníes. Sobre el particular Rahnema expresó: “...yo ahora necesito a ver si hay una palanca a través de D'Elía...de Cancillería...de Pérsico ...de Fernando*’... porque yo quiero llamar a la Embajada Argentina en Teherán...porque la Cámara de Comercio de Teherán quiere tener una reunión para abrir el camino que todas las empresas privadas directamente ...para llevarlo a la Cámara de Comercio de Teherán, el agregado del negocio de Argentina que están en Teherán...quería llevarlo ahí, para hablar en la Cámara y la Cámara está muy interesada que las empresas privadas...empiezan a arrancar los negocios con Argentina... ’’(Comunicación del 14/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-14-125442-12, CD 0025). Más allá de que Rahnema planteaba un interés relativo a relaciones comerciales entre particulares, Khalil le explicó que había transmitido estas inquietudes a Luis D'Elía, quien, a su vez, se las había comunicado al Diputado Andrés “Cuervo” Larroque, quien lo hablaría con la Sra. Presidente de la Nación (Comunicación del 14/05/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-14-131007-12.wav, CD 0025). Khalil explicó: “...yo fui a hablar con D'Elía y le dije...todas las propuestas y de  FISCAL uENEnAL  la cancillería, de la cancillería también...lo que me había propuesto... Y él lo elevó al ""Cuervo” Larroque...el de ""La Cámpora”, el Jefe de ""La Cámpora”...Y ya iban a hablar con Cristina...” (Comunicación del 14/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-14-131007- 12.wav, CD 0025). Tercero. Pocos días después del regreso de Irán del referente local del régimen, Jorge Khalil, y luego de varias comunicaciones en la que puso al tanto a Luis D'Elía de los mensajes de Teherán, debe mencionarse la secuencia ocurrida a partir del día 15 de mayo de 2013, cuando lo llamaron a Khalil para que se comunique urgente con D'Elía que estaba “en Presidencia”. D'Elía puso la comunicación telefónica en altavoz y aclaró que había un funcionario escuchando: “...yo estoy con una persona amiga, que te está escuchando, que yo no voy a nombrar...”. Seguidamente, hablaron de la posibilidad de que delegaciones de ambos países se reunieran en Caracas, en Beirut o en alguna zona del golfo -como habían propuesto los iraníes- para restablecer las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno. En palabras de Khalil: “...Perfecto...si hay un verdadero interés para empezar y entablar las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno, con funcionario de gobierno de acá, una delegación de allá viajaría o a Caracas o al Golfo o a Beirut mejor...o a alguna zona del golfo...para empezar las relaciones directas de funcionarios a funcionarios...”, a lo cual D'Elía le contestó, dado que su acompañante permaneció en silencio: “Bueno. Ok. Con lo que nosotros queremos... ¿no?”, para, luego, terminar acordando (Comunicaciones del 15/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-100907-10, CD 26; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-101055-4, CD 26). Esos contactos ponen en evidencia que para D'Elía, “nosotros” son ciertas autoridades gubernamentales argentinas, para las que opera y para Khalil, en el mismo contexto, “nosotros” es Irán. Fundamentalmente, queda claro el interés de las altas esferas locales por restablecer el comercio entre ambos Estados. Puede inferirse claramente que Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil está transmitiendo la respuesta de Irán a la solicitud argentina de negociar. Cuarto. El evidente interés comercial que motorizó el plan de impunidad se comprueba de modo contundente en las comunicaciones telefónicas registradas los días 19 y 20 de mayo de 2013, que dan cuenta de la reunión entre Luis D'Elía y el Ministro de Planificación Federal, Inversión Pública y Servicios, Arquitecto Julio De Vido, llevada a cabo por orden de Cristina Fernández. Además, como se verá a continuación, las propuestas comunicadas por el Ministro De Vido, a pedido de la Sra. Presidente, fueron posteriormente puestas a consideración del prófugo iraní Mohsen Rabbani, quien dado su poder político intervino indirectamente en las negociaciones con sus encubridores, participando del encubrimiento que lo tiene por beneficiario. Tan insólito como inaceptable. El día 19 de mayo, Luis D’Elía se comunicó con Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil y le dijo: “Ahí hablé con Julio.... Lo tengo que ver mañana a las 10.00...”, en referencia al Ministro De Vido -que para D'Elía es sencillamente “Julio”-, para finalmente aclararle: “...y acá hay urgencia energética, ¿entendés lo que te digo?...” (Comunicación del 19/05/2013, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo 51.78404.20130519.225357, CD 80). Al día siguiente, tuvo lugar la reunión entre D’Elía y el Ministro De Vido. Se transcribe la comunicación: D’Elía: Estoy acá en la puerta de Planificación y entro a ver a Julio ehl Khalil: Bueno, bueno, llamame después. D’Elía: Le voy a tirar eso, eh ¿Dale? Khalil: Dale, si, si tranquilo. (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo 3815, CD 31) Transcurrida la reunión, D'Elía volvió a comunicarse con Khalil: D’Elía: Bueno, mirá, acá estuve hablando con el ‘quía Khalil: sí. D’Elía: Ellos están dispuestos a mandar la gente de YPF con nosotros dos...   Ministerio Público de la Nación Khalil: sí. D’Elía: A hacer negocios allá. Khalil: Bien. D’Elía: Está muy interesado en intercambiar lo de aquellos por granos y carne allá eh. Khalil: Bueno. D’Elía: Y... ¿cómo es? Tiene un problema político, necesitan que se apruebe el memorándum, ¿sí? Khalil: Y si, está el arito ese tema Luis...y o te lo dije el otro día, ¿Manifestaste lo que te dije? D’Elía: Si, yo les dije hace 10 días y me dijeron que en 30 días se aprobaba. Khalil: No, no, yo te dije que el memorándum se iba a aprobar ...yo te lo dije a vos, pero que lo estaban retrasando por esa cuestión* D’Elía: No...no, ahí hubo alguna....conté lo que vos me contaste, el incidente que hubo. Khalil: Si. D’Elía: Y... la reunión fue porque lo pidió la jefa ¡eh! Khalil: Bueno. D’Elía: Estamos al más alto nivel. Khalil: quiere decir que estamos bien. D’Elía: Si, si, re bien	ahora, si a nosotros no nos aprueban el memo ese, quedamos como unos pelotudos allá, ¿viste? Khalil: ¿Si no lo aprueban? Lo van a aprobar, eso lo van a aprobar... D’Elía: Bueno, pero a la brevedad lo tienen que aprobar, viste Khalil: Lo van a aprobar Luis, vos sabés cómo son los tiempos en Persiay aparte la lógicas que no se cumplen, o sea....eehh...De Vido tiene que saber que “Timerman no cumplió con algunas cosas "", esto es así de claro. no cumplió con algunas cosas.... (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-111124-8, CD31). Se refiere a que no se habían dado de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Cinco revelaciones primordiales surgen de estas conversaciones. 1) La familiaridad con De Vido, a quien llaman por su nombre de pila: “Julio”. 2) El interés por enviar a YPF a negociar con Irán, para intercambiar “granos por petróleo”, que llevó a las más altas autoridades nacionales a ordenar y ejecutar un encubrimiento. 3) La necesidad de que Irán apruebe el Memorando de Entendimiento como condición para iniciar los intercambios comerciales. Aquí radica una de las razones por las que se firmó semejante documento y la evidencia de que el acuerdo ha sido un medio para habilitar el comercio. 4) La reunión entre el Ministro De Vido y D’Elía, “/a pidió la jefa ”, la primera interesada en que el plan de encubrimiento avance pues se trata de la llave que destraba el comercio. 5) El acuerdo secreto del canciller Timerman para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, su fracaso en las acciones destinadas a lograrlo y la consecuente frustración iraní por la persistencia de las prioridades de búsqueda policial. Más tarde, ese mismo día, Jorge Khalil informó a Irán del avance de las negociaciones. Le avisó a Abdul Karim Paz, sheik de la mezquita “At Tauhid”, líder religioso de la comunidad musulmana chiita y mano derecha de Mohsen Rabbani, quien se encontraba en Irán, que: “...el tema que necesita Argentina es petróleo, todo petróleo, y todo lo que está comprando...Irán en grano se lo pueden dar, ese petróleo a cambio de granos... ” y agregó: “...Argentina tiene una gran necesidad de petróleo e Irán tiene una gran necesidad de granos y todo eso, empezar el intercambio...'"" (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-133130-8, CD 31). Seguidamente, continuó reportando a Irán: “ ...mirá que está todo para darse, decile, que se dejen de hinchar las pelotas...” y destacó: “...yo te estoy diciendo ahora es el tema de...que me lo pide Cancillería y De Vido respondió: si yo tengo que mandar a la gente responsable de YPF para hacer negocio ...necesitan crudo, petróleo...y empezar a intercambiar...” (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-133130- 8, CD 31). Al BPRTO MISM Ministerio Público de la Nación	fiscal	geneha. Y	lo resumió: “...Acá hay luz verde para hacer las operaciones y mandar a la gente, el tema es que quieren que se apure el memorándum ...En principio, deciles que el tema que necesita Argentina es petróleo, todo petróleo, y todo lo que está comprando...Irán en grano se lo pueden dar, ese petróleo a cambio de granos... ¿entendés? ...y se habló con De Vi do... que todo esto se habló con De Vido... Argentina tiene una gran necesidad de petróleo e Irán tiene una gran necesidad de granos y todo eso, empezar el intercambio. Eso por un lado. Por el otro lado, De Vido entiende que para dar un paso en esto...o sea oficial, de Estado a Estado, tiene que haber firma del memorándum, porque si no, siguen los privados, nada más...como están laburando...O sea, que se firme primero el memorándum para empezar a hacerlo de Estado a Estado, porque por ahora los únicos que están trabajando son los privados...” (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 133130-8, CD 31). También resaltó: “...hay otro mensaje más importante de hoy, fresco, de que están dispuestos a mandar ya a los jefes de YPF a Caracas a juntarse con los responsables que sea...de ahí...’’’' y le aclaró que viajarían tanto él -Khalil- como Luis D'Elía (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-05-20-132253-6, CD 31). Luego de estos reportes de Khalil, Abdul Karim Paz -quien se encontraba en Irán- efectuó consultas a las autoridades locales y transmitió la respuesta: “...acá están listos desde siempre, que el problema lo tienen más que nada allá... per o dicen que pongan fecha y que acá no hay problema, va una delegación para allá a Venezuela y arreglan todo, no hay problema...que ellos pongan la fecha cuando quieren ir...” (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 140034-12, CD 31). Seguidamente, Khalil retransmitió el mensaje de Teherán a un colaborador de Luis D'Elía: “...Hablé con Baharvand...transmitile esto a Luis...me dice Bahai’vand que están interesados, que pongan fecha y ya mandan a la delegación a donde crean ellos conveniente para empezar las tratativas, es decir, no hay ningún tipo de inconveniente...el que viaja creo que es Baha...va a ir él, no va a ir cualquier cuatro de copas...es el que ¡leva las negociaciones...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-143508-24, CD 31). Por si esto fuera poco, toda esta negociación culmina en manos del imputado Mohsen Rabbani. Así se lo informó Khalil: “...hoy terminamos una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos...”, a lo que Rabbani le contesta: “Mándeme para que yo evalúe... ”, dejando totalmente claro que Rabbani conserva capacidad de decisión dentro del régimen en todas las cuestiones relacionadas con la República Argentina (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31). Es inconcebible, altos funcionarios del gobierno argentino terminan negociando secretamente con un imputado de la causa AMIA, a quien, además, benefician con una desvinculación judicial ilegal mediante sofisticadas maniobras de encubrimiento. Unos días más tarde, Rabbani volvió a tomar parte en las negociaciones afirmando: “Yo les dije que nosotros...eh...habíamos conversado con Argentina, la verdad de...sufrimos mucho para que Irán, todas las compras ...Irán fue el primer comprador de Argentina y ahora no compra casi nada” y agregó: “pero puede cambiar...algo que es muy importante aquí, hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina, vender tractores ....y comprar armas...” (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Difícil de entender y mucho más de aceptar: altas autoridades argentinas entablaron una negociación secreta con un imputado de la causa AMIA, que además planifica “comprar armas”. Nótese en la secuencia. El 18 de julio de 1994 ocurrió un atentado terrorista en Buenos Aires. La justicia investigó y determinó responsabilidades de varios sujetos de nacionalidad iraní en la ideación y planificación de ese atentado. Esas personas han estado hasta la actualidad protegidas por el régimen al que pertenecen y que gobierna la República Islámica de Irán. El gobierno nacional negoció un acuerdo con ese país y, pasando por alto a la justicia y a la Constitución Nacional, brindó el marco jurídico necesario para que aquellos acusados puedan quedar desvinculados fraudulentamente de la causa por el atentado e impunes. Y en ese contexto, uno de los prófugos de la justicia argentina y beneficiario del pacto ilegal, Mohsen Rabbani, envalentonado por la posición del gobierno argentino, en lugar de responder las serias acusaciones que se alzan en su contra, negocia su impunidad, decide los pasos a seguir, controla el avance del plan criminal y, además, planifica “comprar armas”. Es decir, en el marco de este acercamiento entre las partes, que garantiza la impunidad de los acusados, uno de los principales prófugos decide y negocia comprarle armas a nuestro país. Esta cadena de conversaciones es importante debido a que revela, por un lado, que quienes motorizaron el plan de encubrimiento fue un grupo de funcionarios argentinos y sus cómplices. Demuestra también que Irán no necesitaba aprobar el Memorando de Entendimiento para negociar. Estaba dispuesto a comerciar de todos modos y así lo manifestó uno de sus más importantes representantes oficiales, el Ex Encargado de negocios en Argentina, Mohsen Baharvand expresando que estaban “listos desde siempre ”. Esto último es central. Desde el primer momento la cúpula del régimen iraní supo que para las autoridades argentinas imputadas en esta maniobra, era vital encaminar primero el Memorando de Entendimiento antes de avanzar con el intercambio comercial. Ese mensaje había llegado perfectamente a Teherán. Por su parte, las autoridades iraníes habían expresado su histórico interés por comerciar. Les resultaba indiferente la aprobación o no del Memorando de Entendimiento. No existen indicios que sustenten que la cuestión en torno a la causa AMIA fuera impedimento alguno para que Teherán retomara los lazos comerciales con Buenos Aires. Sólo firmaron el Memorando de Entendimiento, por haber acordado que ello sería suficiente para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas. No preocupaban las acusaciones de la justicia argentina, sino únicamente que sus funcionarios puedan circular irrestrictamente por el mundo. De hecho, señales históricas previas a estas acciones delictivas, dan cuenta de la siempre vigente intención de Teherán por comerciar con Buenos Aires. Ejemplo de ello, en el año 2007, tras una reunión con el entonces canciller iraní, Manuchehr Nottaki, D'Elía -ya entonces activo partícipe de este entramado de contactos- anunció que Irán quería reabrir la relación comercial con Argentina (Obarrio, Mariano, “D'Elía prometió acercarse más a Irán”, La Nación, 28/02/2007; “Causa AMIA: Para D'Elía, los acusados iraníes van a ser sobreseídos”, Infobae, 1/3/2013). Además, una vez oficializadas las negociaciones entre ambos países en relación a la causa AMIA, el entonces Presidente iraní declaró públicamente: “Estoy seguro de que cuando las investigaciones tengan lugar de manera precisa e imparcial, a continuación se avanzará en la ampliación de las relaciones entre Irán y Argentina” (“Ahmadinejad: Iran- Argentina transparent talks over AMIA leads to expansión of ties”, Fars News, 2/10/2012). Días antes, en rueda de prensa, había aseverado que esperaba “sostener conversaciones tendientes a alcanzar la verdad’ en relación al caso. Dijo: “Afortunadamente los argentinos han aceptado la propuesta. Tengo esperanza de que el diálogo entre los dos cancilleres pueda sentar las bases y una agenda para lograr este objetivo ”, agregando: “Queremos expandir nuestras relaciones....” (“Ahmadinejad dice que quiere 'expandir las relaciones' con la Argentina”, Clarín, 26/09/2012). Estas expresiones por parte del presidente iraní en ejercicio en aquel momento, en el marco de las tratativas que estaban llevándose a cabo, remiten nuevamente a la retórica de deslegitimación sobre la actuación judicial argentina, sobre la necesidad de otra dirección en la pesquisa y - fundamentalmente- sobre el siempre vigente interés por comerciar.   Estos son ejemplos que demuestran que la República Islámica de Irán estaba dispuesta a negociar sin necesidad de ratificar el Memorando de Entendimiento porque, a diferencia del gobierno argentino, nada tenía que explicar a su ciudadanía. De allí que su interés en la firma de ese documento, como se verá, no estuvo centrado en el comercio entre Estados sino el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que pesan sobre sus funcionarios. Una vez más, corresponde aclarar que el comercio con Irán o con cualquier estado es, en sí mismo, perfectamente legítimo. Delictivo es acordar la impunidad de un crimen de lesa humanidad, cualquiera fuera el motivo. En suma, las pruebas demuestran la existencia de un manifiesto interés de la cúpula del gobierno argentino por restablecer las relaciones comerciales con Irán -dada la severa crisis energética nacional-, como así también la urgente necesidad de borrar de un plumazo las acusaciones del caso AMIA para poder llevar adelante ese propósito. Aquí radica, según la evidencia reunida, uno de los motivos -quizás el principal- de la Presidente para impulsar el plan de encubrimiento, cuya investigación se propicia con la presente denuncia, para el juzgamiento y castigo de todos los que han tomado parte. Aclárese una vez más que aquí no se pone en tela de juicio la decisión de establecer relaciones comerciales con otras potencias extranjeras. Se conoce que dichas decisiones no son judiciables. Además son, en su esencia, legítimas. Lo que sí se cuestiona y se denuncia son las circunstancias que han tornado delictivo este cuadro de situación, esto es, la decisión de encubrir a un conjunto de prófugos de la justicia argentina en un caso de terrorismo internacional como medio ilegal para resolver un conflicto bilateral nacido de una investigación judicial, y así habilitar, entre otras cosas, el comercio entre los países. Sucede que las autoridades argentinas no han condicionado por capricho el restablecimiento de las tan anheladas relaciones comerciales con Irán, a ciertos pasos en la ejecución del plan encubridor. Cristina Fernández estaba convencida que sin la aprobación del Memorando de Entendimiento y, por ende, del encubrimiento, le hubiese resultado muy costoso avanzar en el terreno comercial. Por ello, como ya se aseveró y se probó, se tomó el camino de la mentira, el engaño, la manipulación y el delito. Se pergeñó un plan de encubrimiento y, en su parte pública, se lo disfrazó de negociaciones diplomáticas y de tratado bilateral. Todo esto motiva la presente denuncia. b.	3) Pruebas del interés geopolítico por alinearse con Irán En paralelo al interés de la Dra. Fernández y su Canciller por restablecer intercambios comerciales al nivel estatal con Irán, como paliativo para la severa crisis energética, también se obtuvieron elementos probatorios que dan cuenta de una motivación de índole geopolítica, que - según esas pruebas- contribuyó a impulsar la decisión y la ejecución del plan de impunidad aquí denunciado. En este sentido, resultan sustancialmente reveladoras las palabras de “Alian”, quien ha jugado un papel clave en el plan criminal, dada su vinculación a la Secretaría de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación y cercanía al entorno presidencial, y su activa relación con el operador local de Teherán, Jorge Khalil. Este individuo, que funcionó como nexo entre distintos partícipes del plan y que contribuyó activamente en la elaboración de la pista falsa para redireccionar la investigación, afirmó: “...ya estamos en otro país, es otra situación mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Con esas palabras, aludía a que existía un nuevo escenario geopolítico en el que ya no convenía sostener la enemistad con Irán, por lo que estos operadores, y así lo dijo “Alian”, se vieron en la necesidad de “trabajar en otro contexto”, para lo cual se planeó que viniera “...otra hipótesis con otras pruebas...”, que descolocara al suscripto, que lo dejara ALBEBTONIS^AN FISCAL GENER “...culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas...lo que viene ahora...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). En una misma conversación telefónica, “Alian” explicó esta íntima ligazón entre la nueva situación mundial y la necesidad de redireccionar la acusación para desvincular definitiva y fraudulentamente a Irán. Ya en noviembre de 2012, previo a la firma del pacto, los partícipes hablaban de la necesidad de “...construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA...”, y del rol de los servicios de inteligencia en esa tarea (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-l 009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Y las palabras de “Alian” explican que ello también se originó en un reposicionamiento geopolítico de la Argentina. Nuevamente, cabe señalar que las decisiones políticas que hacen a la dirección de las relaciones exteriores de la Nación no están siendo analizadas ni cuestionadas en estas líneas. Solamente se las menciona porque, según las pruebas, revelan que el plan de impunidad también estuvo motorizado por razones de índole geopolítica. Pero como ya se dijo en relación al interés comercial, es la decisión de dotar de impunidad a los prófugos iraníes, y no tal o cual alineamiento internacional, lo que posee importancia jurídico-penal. Por lo demás, cabe señalar que más allá de los intereses comerciales y geopolíticos constatados en el material probatorio obtenido hasta el momento, no se puede descartar que hayan existido otros motivos alternativos y complementarios que hayan contribuido también a impulsar la decisión y las maniobras de encubrimiento aquí expuestas, los cuales podrán ser determinados en el curso de la pesquisa que aquí se propicia. b)	Memorando de Entendimiento Explicada la decisión y los motivos de los encubridores para colocar intereses espurios y delictivos por encima de la justicia y la ley, se explicará en este punto otro aspecto del plan de encubrimiento. El Memorando de Entendimiento ha sido concebido como el instrumento que contribuye más eficazmente a la consecución del plan destinado a desvincular del caso y dotar de impunidad a un conjunto de imputados por el atentado contra la AMIA. Se advierte que este plan criminal se distingue por su sofisticación. No se trata de alguien que ayuda a un prófugo ocultándolo circunstancialmente en su casa, para eludir a las agencias de seguridad en la persecución. Aquí se tomó la decisión y se acordó la impunidad de los imputados y, luego, se buscó diagramar un modo de llevarlo adelante con visos de aparente legalidad, para hacerlo pasar por un acto legítimo ante los ojos de la sociedad argentina, primero, y del mundo después, insistiendo que el diálogo era el mejor mecanismo para solucionar los conflictos. El acuerdo debía poder ser presentado como un instrumento pensado para procurar justicia, cuando -en realidad- estaba y está claramente destinado a lo contrario: a obstruirla y a impedirla. De allí la elaborada sofisticación del delito denunciado. La suscripción del Memorando de Entendimiento entre Argentina e Irán fue anunciado el 27 de enero de 2013 en Adís Abeba, Reino de Etiopía. Tanto la Sra. Presidente como el Canciller Timerman lo presentaron como un “logro histórico'1'’ y, como reiterarían hasta el hartazgo, afirmaron que se trataba de una herramienta que facilitaría la cooperación internacional, especialmente pensada para colaborar con la justicia argentina en la causa AMIA. Ese mismo día, Jorge Khalil, agente del régimen iraní en Buenos Aires y contacto personal del prófugo Mohsen Rabbani, celebraba: “...este acuerdo...esta nueva relación...esta nueva etapa...” (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-27-112032-4, CD 266). Pero si el acuerdo, en teoría, había sido creado para contribuir con los requerimientos de la justicia argentina, si -como se dijo luego- se había logrado que Teherán se allane y si -como también se dijo- esto Ministerio Público de la Nación	A!	berto	nism rlSCAL GENERA,. serviría para sentar a los prófugos ante el Juez de la causa: ¿qué es lo que festejaba Jorge Khalil, uno de los hombres de máxima confianza de Mohsen Rabbani en Buenos Aires? ¿La indagatoria de su jefe? ¿Qué finalmente la justicia tenía un modo de obligarlo a comparecer, cuando éste evitó hacerlo por casi una década, amparándose en inmunidades diplomáticas y en el territorio de Irán? Si el pacto tenía por único norte lograr las indagatorias de los imputados, como se afirmó, ¿por qué se negociaron en secreto intercambios comerciales por petróleo? ¿Y, en todo caso, por qué se negó que hubiera tratativas al respecto? ¿Por qué el Ministro De Vido se reunió y habló con Luis D'Elía de este intercambio, a pedido de la Presidente Cristina Fernández, si lo único que importaba era asistir a la justicia? De hecho, mientras se afirmaba que se pretendía contribuir al avance con la causa judicial, por detrás, en el mayor de los secretos, sin que los sobrevivientes y los familiares de las víctimas supieran, sin que nadie supiera nada, ¡negociaban con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani por petróleo y armas! Al día siguiente de la firma del pacto, el sujeto identificado como “Alian”, partícipe de este encubrimiento, que responde a un sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia y tiene acceso al entorno presidencial, llamó - justamente- a Jorge Khalil y exultante dijo: “Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me tenías feen clara alusión a la suscripción del acuerdo (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). Nuevamente cabe preguntarse: ¿Por qué la firma de un acuerdo que teóricamente pondría a su jefe, Mohsen Rabbani, frente a la justicia que venía eludiendo iba a tranquilizar y/o alegrar a Khalil? ¿Qué parte de semejante escenario podía ser considerado un triunfo por Khalil? ¿Por qué un agente de inteligencia argentino, como “Alian”, comparte los intereses con un agente orgánico del régimen iraní en la Argentina? Las circunstancias que se analizarán en todo este acápite revelan, justamente, que Khalil tenía claros motivos para alegrarse, festejar y tranquilizarse ante la firma del “Memorando de Entendimiento”, porque significaba que se materializaba el plan de encubrimiento de Rabbani y de todos los otros acusados iraníes. Y Khalil lo sabía, conocía perfectamente que el documento que se había firmado era un simple camuflaje jurídico que escondía bajo una apariencia legal un pacto mucho más amplio, acordado de antemano, que beneficiaba a sus jefes, puesto que tenía la capacidad para desvincularlos definitivamente de las imputaciones que se les habían hecho por su responsabilidad en el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA. Esta reflexión viene al caso pues en este punto se planteará justamente el rol que este acuerdo tiene en un plan delictivo mucho más amplio y del cual no es la única ni la última pieza, aunque -sin lugar a dudas- la más visible de todas. En efecto, la vaguedad, ambigüedad e imprecisión de su texto ha permitido dotar de flexibilidad al plan, previendo distintos caminos hacia el encubrimiento y la impunidad de los imputados iraníes. Estas disposiciones incluidas en un mismo texto son lo suficientemente versátiles para poder alternarse entre unas y otras o bien combinarse de acuerdo a las necesidades políticas de quienes se encuentran involucrados en este plan. Así, a priori, existen disposiciones en el texto que permiten encubrir a los acusados de distintas maneras: a) propiciando el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol (punto 7); b) garantizando impunidad mediante la instauración acordada de un procedimiento intrincado, infinito, que no conduce a nada y que solo diluye acusaciones y viabiliza desincriminación, alternativa notablemente favorecida por la ausencia total de plazos que marquen la implementación del acuerdo; y c) articulando, a través de la “Comisión de la Verdad” creada en el pacto, la desvinculación total de los imputados respecto del atentado contra la AMIA, permitiendo redireccionar la pesquisa hacia otros autores e hipótesis. En fin, el documento contiene numerosos recursos y opciones para avanzar con el plan criminal, conforme lo exijan sus autores y Ministerio Público de la Nación	r FISCAL GENEriA ejecutores, en virtud de la enorme cantidad de variables que operan en una maniobra de tamaña sofisticación. c.	1) Cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Interés de Irán De los ocho	imputados de origen iraní	con pedido de captura nacional	e	internacional	por el caso AMIA, hay cinco que -como ya se explicó en la parte introductoria- tienen la máxima prioridad de búsqueda por parte de Interpol (notificaciones rojas) y, cabe tener presente, estos sujetos ostentan un significativo peso en la escena política iraní. Las pruebas	obtenidas indican que han	existido negociaciones y acuerdos	previos entre	las partes sobre el cese de	las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. En efecto, los elementos reunidos hasta el momento permiten concluir que la baja de las notificaciones rojas constituyó el interés central para las autoridades iraníes en este acuerdo y el Canciller Timerman aceptó y contribuyó a ello. Hizo todo lo posible para que ese objetivo fuera cumplido por Interpol. Más allá, claro está, de sus declaraciones públicas en sentido contrario, porque sostener la verdad, además de confesar su participación en el plan delictivo, hubiese sido incompatible con los reclamos de justicia en este expediente. La diligente y a la vez inesperada - para los encubridores- actitud de Interpol, específicamente de su Secretario General, Ronald Noble, se lo impidió. La primera prueba que abona dicha afirmación es la existencia del documento que describió el Sr. José Ricardo “Pepe” Eliaschev en su declaración testimonial. En el mismo, el Ministro Salehi proponía al Presidente Ahmadinejad, que lo autoricen a solicitar la revocación de los pedidos de captura internacional con respaldo de Interpol, expresando un especial interés en mejorar la situación procesal del entonces Ministro de Defensa Ahmad Vahidi, uno de los imputados con notificación roja vigente (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). No está de más recordar que entre los días 31 de mayo y 1 de junio de 2011, Bolivia había recibido al entonces Ministro de Defensa de Irán, Ahmad Vahidi, uno de los prófugos de la causa AMIA, haciendo caso omiso de la orden de captura internacional dictada por la justicia argentina y las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Solo el repudio generalizado que desató este recibimiento forzó al gobierno boliviano a expulsar al funcionario iraní (“Bolivia echó a Ministro de Defensa iraní acusado por atentado en la Argentina”, Infobae.com, 31/5/2011; “Evo expulsó a un funcionario iraní”, Página 12, 1/6/2011; “Bolivia pide disculpas a la Argentina y expulsa a Ministro de Defensa iraní”, El mundo, 1/6/2011). Bajo juramento el testigo Eliaschev aseveró que el documento que tuvo oportunidad de ver consistía en “un informe de la cancillería iraní al presidente Ahmadinejad, un típico ‘paper’ intergubernamental, donde el responsable de las relaciones exteriores del régimen de ese país le sugiere al presidente que en virtud de los elementos de juicio que maneja la cancillería iraní corresponde avanzar en un acuerdo importante con Argentina porque...están dadas las condiciones para que los argentinos decidan dar vuelta de página... ” (fs. 131.189/131.194). Como ya se mencionó al hablar de los ofrecimientos rechazados por Néstor Kirchner, existió un antecedente al pacto con Irán, del año 2006, que fue redactado por Fernando Esteche quien, junto con Jorge Khalil, lo hicieron llegar a las autoridades de ambos gobiernos. De ello dan cuenta una serie de comunicaciones telefónicas que han quedado judicialmente registradas: “...lo único que sé que es el mismo documento que hicimos nosotros hace seis años y lo presentamos, tanto en la Embajada de Irán como a gente del gobierno... ”, “...el mismo, boludo, el mismo pusieron...como lo dijimos nosotros ...todo como lo escribimos con Fernando hace seis años... ”, “...el acuerdo que hicimos hace seis años nosotros con Fernando Esteche y nos trataron de locos a nosotros ...cuando lo planteamos, lo mismo, está escrito, hace seis, siete años, en el 2006...nos dijeron 'están locos, esto no tiene asidero’...hoy lo sacaron... ”, “...decían que esto era imposible, que no se podía hacer... ”, ""... ¿Sabes quien me lo escribió a mí, ese día, el memorando ese, quién lo escribió?...Fernando... ”, en alusión a Esteche (Comunicaciones del 27/01/13, abonado N°11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01 -27-174637-12, CD 266; Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-27-112032-4, CD 266; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-112552-12, CD 266; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266). En esa oportunidad, Khalil había aclarado: “...ese plan lo hicimos con Fernando Esteche hace seis años ...cuando se lo llevé a Baharvand, me dijo no...” (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado N°ll- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266). Es decir, que si bien Kirchner no lo había aceptado, tampoco había tenido acogida en Irán. Hoy se puede concluir que el rechazo iraní se pudo deber a que, en aquella época, INTERPOL no había emitido aún las notificaciones rojas contra los funcionarios persas y, en consecuencia, no existía el motivo que activó posteriormente el interés de Teherán en avanzar con un acuerdo por el tema,	conforme ha sido probado en esta	presentación.	Sin notificaciones rojas que desactivar, no había interés de Irán para firmar ningún acuerdo con Argentina. Esto implica que desde el inicio mismo de estas negociaciones, la parte iraní estaba especialmente interesada en	dar de	baja	las notificaciones	rojas de Interpol y tenía como norte	favorecer	con	esa medida a los	cinco afectados, pero en particular, al	entonces	Ministro Vahidi. De hecho, las pruebas no revelan otros intereses tan concretos por parte de Teherán. La disposición séptima del Memorando de Entendimiento fue el punto de partida para habilitar la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, es decir, el primer paso para garantizar la impunidad de los imputados. b.	l.a) El punto séptimo, la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas y el consecuente desinterés de Irán La maniobra para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol se tradujo con sutileza en el texto del acuerdo, precisamente en el punto 7o que establece: “Este acuerdo, luego de ser firmado, será remitido conjuntamente por ambos cancilleres al Secretario General de Interpol en cumplimiento a requisitos exigidos por Interpol con relación a este caso”. La falta de precisiones en el texto sobre la implicancia de la comunicación prevista en esta disposición, cuya operatividad a sola firma -la única de todo el acuerdo- y sin necesidad de ratificación interna la distingue del resto del acuerdo, permitió esgrimir argumentos dirigidos a relativizar la razonable sospecha inmediata que despertó este punto. Al conocerse el memorando, tanto la dirigencia comunitaria judía local como grupos de familiares y víctimas del atentado, entre otros, expresaron su profunda preocupación sobre la verdadera implicancia de esta comunicación y su potencial letalidad respecto de las búsquedas prioritarias ordenadas por Interpol. En este sentido, se alegó que mediante esta comunicación se estaban cumpliendo compromisos asumidos ante Interpol que son inexistentes. Nada se había acordado ni existía compromiso alguno. De hecho, agrupaciones de víctimas, familiares y entidades comunitarias intentaron que la cancillería argentina propicie un anexo al memorando de entendimiento donde se especifique -entre otras cosas- que su suscripción en nada afectaría a la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas. Como se verá más adelante, si bien primero trascendió que ello había sido acordado con Timerman, luego el Canciller negó haberse comprometido con familiares y dirigentes comunitarios a tramitar un anexo al acuerdo. Estaba claro que numerosos sectores sociales argentinos, guiados por conclusiones hermenéuticas surgidas del análisis de este punto 7 advirtieron que su aplicación podría derivar en el cese de las notificaciones rojas. Lo novedoso es que se han hallado pruebas que confirman esa sospecha. Ahora se encuentra probado que justamente el cese   Ministerio Público de la Nación de esas notificaciones fue uno de los puntos pactados secretamente por el Canciller Timerman por tratarse del interés principal de la contraparte iraní para firmar el acuerdo. La prueba reveladora de que las expectativas iniciales de los firmantes del acuerdo eran que Interpol levante las capturas son las manifestaciones de quienes participaron activamente de las tratativas entre las autoridades argentinas e iraníes, por canales paralelos y en secreto, y que -naturalmente- sabían de la existencia del acuerdo secreto de Timerman para el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. En febrero de 2013, apenas un mes después del acuerdo, hablando con el referente local de Irán Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, “Alian” le confesó que en la Secretaría de Inteligencia se comentaba que Interpol iba a levantar las notificaciones rojas que pesaban sobre los imputados iraníes. En concreto, dijo: “Tengo un chisme...me dijeron ahí en la casa ...Interpol va a levantar el pedido de captura de los amigos...Lo va a levantar ahora ”. Khalil se alegró: “¡No me digas! ¡Menos mal!” (Comunicación del 25/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-25-151137-12, CD 295). El entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán, Alí Pakdaman, ya le había avisado a Khalil, el mismo día de la firma del acuerdo con Irán, que iba a tener mejores noticias aún. Así lo explicó Khalil: “...lo llamé a Pakdaman...yo ya estaba al tanto, me dice. Son buenas noticias, me dice, y vas a tener mejores noticias todavía, me dijo. Recién, recién, hace un ratito...” (Comunicación del 27/01/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-122441-28, CD 266). Esto contribuye a corroborar que el levantamiento de las notificaciones rojas formó parte de la negociación secreta. En otras palabras, esa era la información que circulaba y, tal como había sido acordado por argentinos e iraníes en la ejecución del plan de impunidad y plasmado en el punto 7 de la letra del memorando, el cese de las notificaciones rojas asomaba como una posibilidad cierta. Por su parte, la interpretación que Irán tenía del punto siete del acuerdo, resulta ser un elemento central para entender el verdadero significado del mismo. En ese sentido, un primer indicio surgió cuando la agencia oficial de noticias iraní (IRNA) publicó bajo el título “Memorando de Entendimiento firmado entre Irán y Argentina: Gran éxito diplomático”, el análisis jurídico que del texto del acuerdo realizó el experto iraní en derecho internacional, Mohammad Hossein Mahdavi. En ese documento, el jurista sostuvo: “El propósito del artículo [punto 7 del memorando], en realidad, era que las dos partes conjuntamente señalaban a INTERPOL que la diferencia entre las dos partes por el caso AMIA, y que motivó que algunas personas aparezcan en la lista de alerta roja de esta organización, se había resuelto a través de la cooperación mutua, y por lo tanto, la INTERPOL podía anular esta lista...” (Mahdavi, Mohammad Hossein, “Memorando de Entendimiento firmado entre Irán y Argentina: Gran éxito diplomático”, IRNA, 7/2/2013). Esta interpretación fue indiscutidamente refrendada por las declaraciones del propio Ministro Salehi -cofirmante del tratado- cuando, según informó la agencia de noticias IRNA, manifestó que: “según el acuerdo firmado por ambos países, la Interpol (Policía Internacional) debe eliminar las acusaciones contra las autoridades iraníes” y criticó a Interpol por haber aseverado que las mismas permanecían vigentes (IRNA, “Salehi: Irán y Argentina trabajan conjuntamente para resolver las acusaciones sobre la AMIA”, 18/03/2013; “Irán asegura que el acuerdo con Argentina incluye retirar las “notas rojas” de Interpol”, La Nación, 18 de marzo de 2013; “Tehran insists accord with Argentina includes Interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects”, Mercopress, 19/03/2013). Como bien lo aclaró el canciller iraní, se esperaba que aun sin entrar en vigencia, el acuerdo sirviera para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Si éstas cayeran, ya nada llevaría a los sospechados a ponerse verdaderamente a disposición de la justicia argentina. Porque aunque las notificaciones rojas no han tenido la capacidad para obligar a los acusados iraníes a comparecer ante el juez argentino, claramente se erigieron como el único elemento que dificultó la movilidad internacional de varios de los imputados, estorbando la total impunidad con la que se han conducido hasta ahora. Al respecto, cabe tener presente que en reiteradas ocasiones, esta Unidad Fiscal ha tomado conocimiento de viajes de los acusados al exterior, oportunidades en las que se arriesgaron a ser detenidos, en virtud de los pedidos de captura internacional y notificaciones rojas vigentes. Sin más, en mayo de este año, representantes de la República de Corea consultaron sobre las implicancias de una posible invitación al imputado Mohsen Rezai para que visite dicho país, por lo que el abajo firmante dispuso comunicar inmediatamente a Interpol que, en caso de concretarse la visita, se haga efectiva la orden de captura internacional, con notificación roja, que pesa sobre el nombrado (Oficio del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto del 9/05/2014, Nota n°5572/14; Oficio al Jefe del Departamento Interpol de la Policía Federal Argentina fechado en 12/5/2014). Las evidencias obtenidas demuestran que Salehi había acordado con Timerman que el cese de las notificaciones rojas se produciría con la sola firma del memorando de entendimiento. Por ello, el artículo 7mo - referido a la comunicación a Interpol- fue el único previsto con carácter operativo. El único que podía y debía tener aplicación inmediata. El resto de los puntos del acuerdo necesitan la ratificación de ambas partes, el intercambio de notas reversales y la vigencia del tratado para que puedan ser cumplidos. La comunicación de la firma del acuerdo a un organismo exclusivamente policial, sin injerencia ni interés alguno en los tratados o avenimientos entre sus estados miembros, como es Interpol, tuvo como único propósito el cese de las notificaciones rojas de los prófugos iraníes. Lo cierto fue que las intenciones criminales para viabilizar la impunidad de los cinco acusados con prioridad de búsqueda policial por la causa AMIA, chocaron con un obstáculo inesperado. Con fecha 15 de marzo de 2013, la Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal - Interpol- envió una misiva al Canciller Timerman, firmada por Joel Sollier, Consejero Jurídico del organismo, en la que, en referencia al memorando de entendimiento, afirmaba:	La	Oficina de Asuntos Jurídicos de la Secretaría General de INTERPOL manifiesta que dicho acuerdo no implica ningún tipo de cambio en el estatus de las notificaciones rojas publicadas en relación a los crímenes investigados en la causa AMIA...” (Nota N° LA/35678-47/3.1/EGI/tsa, Consejería Jurídica, Secretaría General, Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal, 15/03/2013). Seguidamente, en el mes de mayo de 2013, el canciller argentino se reunió con el Secretario General de Interpol, Sr. Ronald Noble en Lyon, Francia. El Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto emitió un comunicado donde afirmó: “...Durante ¡a reunión, el Secretario General Noble reafirmó los términos vertidos por el Consejero General de Interpol en la carta del 15 de marzo, en el sentido que el Memorándum con Irán no afecta en forma alguna el estatus de ¡as notificaciones rojas emitidas por Interpol a instancias de la Argentina...” (Comunicado de Prensa N° 122/13 del 30/05/2013). Por su parte, Interpol reiteró esta misma información por comunicado oficial (Interpol, “La visita del canciller argentino a Interpol se centró en la colaboración policial internacional”, 30/05/2013). Justamente, la demora y reticencia del gobierno de Irán en la ratificación del memorando respondió a que el Canciller Timerman se vio impedido de cumplir con el compromiso secreto asumido respecto de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que debían cesar y no cesaron. Esto explica un hecho palpable: el retraimiento de Irán. Desde el momento en que Interpol comunicó que no caerían las notificaciones, Irán suspendió el tratamiento interno de ratificación del acuerdo, retirándolo del parlamento donde estaba incluido en el orden de temas a ser tratados, difiriendo en forma indefinida su implementación (Pagni, Carlos, “El kirchnerismo en el peor de los mundos”, La Nación, 30/05/2013; “Timerman estimó que en el próximo mes y medio el parlamento iraní aprobará el acuerdo por la AMIA”, Télam, 18/4/13; “Ultimátum oficial a   Ministerio Público de la Nación Irán: Espero que en un mes aprueben el memorándum”, Infobae, 18/04/2013; “Reclaman a Irán el aval al acuerdo”, Clarín, 19/04/2013). Sin perjuicio de ello y hasta la actualidad, las autoridades argentinas involucradas en este tema han intentado subsanar este contratiempo y han buscado persuadir a Irán para que acelere sus procesos internos, a fin de contribuir al plan de encubrimiento en marcha. En ese contexto, en abril de 2013, Timerman declaró: “Yo espero que en el próximo mes, mes y medio ya esté aprobado ...cuanto más tarden ellos, más dudas se van a crear sobre sus intenciones. Nosotros cumplimos con nuestra parte y estamos esperando que Irán cumpla con la suya"" (“Timerman estimó que en el próximo mes y medio el parlamento iraní aprobará el acuerdo por la AMIA”, Télam, 18/4/13; “Cuánto más tarde Irán en aprobar el memorando, más dudas va a generar”, Ámbito Financiero, 18/4/13; “Ultimátum oficial a Irán: Espero que en un mes aprueben el memorándum”, Infobae, 18/04/2013; “Reclaman a Irán el aval al acuerdo”, Clarín, 19/04/2013). En esa oportunidad, el Canciller explicó que el parlamento iraní debía volver del receso legislativo y a partir de allí tenía como prioridad el tratamiento del presupuesto anual y “luego está el tratado con la Argentina” (“Timerman confía en que Irán firmará el pacto en un mes”, La Gaceta, 19/04/2013). Ese mes, mes y medio, ya cumplió más de un año. Con el correr de los meses y, sobre todo, luego de la comunicación de Interpol de que las notificaciones rojas seguirían vigentes, Teherán advirtió que al canciller argentino le había sido impedido, por razones ajenas a su voluntad, cumplir lo prometido. Y así lo hizo saber, transmitiendo su malestar. Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, al día siguiente de haber regresado de la República Islámica de Irán, y luego de haberse reunido “con las más altas esferas...con los responsables capos...con la cancillería...” (Comunicación del 11/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-11 - 173407-12, CD 0022), le transmitió claramente al interlocutor paralelo de los funcionarios argentinos, Luis D’Elía, la desilusión iraní frente al compromiso incumplido. Manifestó: Khalil: Juntémonos, porque tenemos algunas tareas para hacer. D’Elía: Ah bueno, bueno, dale, dale, dale...che, ¿por qué está demorado todo eso? Khalil: Yyyyy...hay un poquito de....esto entre nosotros, hay un poquito de desazón de allá, de allá, no sé porque, hay desazón. D’Elía: ¿¡Desazón!? Khalil: Desazón, sí, sí, sí. No gustó algunas palabras que se dijeron eh, me parece... D’Elía: Ajá Khalil: Me parece que el ruso este de mierda  se mandó alguna. D’Elía: ¿Ah sí? Khalil: Si, sí. D’Elía: ¿Qué dijo? Khalil: No..., estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares"" también parece, pero bueno lo hablamos personalmente. D’Elía: Bueno, dale, dale, dale. (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	05-1 l-083146-8.wav, CD 0022). Las palabras de Khalil dejan entrever que, además del Memorando de Entendimiento, se había firmado otro documento, privado y reservado en este caso, en el que estaba incluido el tema de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Esto adquiere mayor veracidad si se lo conjuga con declaraciones del canciller iraní Salehi quien en marzo de 2013 expresó: “...El [contenido] del acuerdo entre Irán y Argentina en relación con la cuestión de la AMIA será hecho público en el momento adecuado y la cuestión [de los imputados iraníes] está incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo...” (“Tehran insists accord with Argentina includes Interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects”, Mercopress, 19/03/2013). Habiendo sido formulada esta declaración en el mes de marzo de 2013, es decir, dos meses después de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, resulta evidente que Salehi estaba hablando de otro acuerdo, de un convenio que en marzo de 2013 todavía no había sido dado a conocer al público en general y que incluía el tema de las notificaciones rojas de los acusados iraníes que, según había dicho anteriormente, debieron haber caído. En otras palabras, al verse truncada la posibilidad de avanzar con el compromiso asumido por parte de Timerman, Salehi reconoció la existencia de un acuerdo secreto sobre el tema. No trepidó en poner en evidencia a Timerman al sentirse traicionado. Cuatro días después de la conversación en la que Khalil comunicó a D'Elía la “desazón” de Teherán porque Timerman se “mandó alguna”, le pidieron a Khalil que se contacte urgente con D'Elía que estaba “en Presidencia”. D'Elía puso la comunicación telefónica en altavoz y aclaró que había un funcionario escuchando: “...yo estoy con una persona amiga, que te está escuchando, que yo no voy a nombrar...”. En esa conversación, Khalil destacó: “...Si, eso es importante, que cuentes eso también. Esos dos mensajes que...que molestaron. Y que de alguna manera u otra están perjudicando la relación...” (Comunicaciones del 15/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-100907-10, CD 26; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-101055-4, CD 26). Luego, el 20 de mayo y a raíz de la reunión entre D'Elía y el Ministro Julio De Vido, Khalil volvió sobre el tema cuando le reiteró a D’Elía: “...De Vido tiene que saber que Timerman no cumplió con algunas cosas, esto es así de claro, no cumplió con algunas cosas...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	05-20-111124-8, CD 31). Y al día siguiente, en relación al mismo tema, D'Elía repitió “...quedó en hablar con la número uno y me llamaba...”, en obvia alusión a la Dra. Fernández (Comunicación del 21/05/2013 abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo 2542, CD 32). El mensaje de “desazón” por el incumplimiento respecto de las notificaciones rojas había llegado de Teherán a la Casa Rosada. Esta cuestión siguió vigente muchos meses después, cuando Khalil volvió a señalar que no existió “dejadez” por parte de Irán en relación a la ratificación interna del pacto (Comunicación del 24/02/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-24-171304-2, CD 311). Ahora bien, frente a la contundencia del compromiso trunco, la reacción de Irán fue engañosa, dado que dijeron haber aprobado el acuerdo por una vía alternativa, sin comunicación oficial alguna y sin generar efectos legales. Aunque astutamente los iraníes actuaron como si se hubiera ratificado. En efecto, con fecha 20 de mayo de 2013 el entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, Alí Pakdaman, informó en una entrevista radial que su país había ratificado el memorando de entendimiento. El acuerdo había sido aprobado por el entonces Presidente de Irán, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, el día anterior, sin tratamiento parlamentario alguno (“Teherán aprobó el memorándum por el atentado a la AMIA”, Página 12, 20/05/2013; Kollmann, Raúl, “Ahmadinejad eligió la vía expeditiva”, Página 12,21/05/2013). En ese contexto, Khalil le dijo a D'Elía: “...Te dije, boludo, que se iba a aprobar, que te quedes tranquilo...” y le reclamó: “...que haga gestos este gobierno, Luis, nosotros ya nos cansamos de hacer gestos, que este gobierno empiece a hacer gestos...” (Comunicación del 20/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-122551 -14, CD 31). Los gestos a los que se refería Khalil eran la baja de las notificaciones rojas, aspiración principal de Irán, prometida por Timerman y nunca concretada debido a la acción de Interpol. En respuesta a ello, el “vocero” del gobierno argentino, Luis D'Elía, respondió: “...pero hay un matiz acá, que va a generar quilombo...lo aprobó Ahmadinejad, no lo aprobó el congreso iraní...” (Comunicación del 20/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-20-130940-28, CD 31) En junio de ese mismo año trascendió que en los días siguientes se daría a conocer la notificación de Irán sobre la aprobación del acuerdo y se realizaría una presentación conjunta de ambos países, para comunicar los pasos a seguir (Dinatale, Martín, “Negó Irán la denuncia del fiscal Nisman y lo acusó de sionista”; La Nación, 4/06/2013). A pesar de la reticencia de Irán, las autoridades argentinas seguían esforzándose para que se ratifique el acuerdo, dado el interés de varios de sus más altos funcionarios en continuar con el plan criminal. En esa línea deben interpretarse las palabras de la Sra. Presidente en ocasión de su discurso en la apertura de la 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, el 24 de septiembre de 2013, cuando afirmó que ya había transcurrido un tiempo prudencial, que la Argentina ya había dado aprobación al acuerdo y que ahora era el tumo de Irán. En sus palabras: “...Ahora esperamos que nos digan si se ha aprobado el acuerdo, cuándo se va a aprobar en caso negativo y que, además, pudiésemos tener una fecha de conformación de la comisión, una fecha también para que el juez argentino pueda ir a Teherán...para que no se confunda...nuestra paciencia con ingenuidad o estupidez” (Discurso de Cristina Fernández, 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2013). Este vivo reclamo derivó en el encuentro de cancilleres que tuvo lugar el 28 de septiembre de 2013, en la sede de Nueva York de las Naciones Unidas, el cual -como se determinó luego y más adelante se verá- se trató de una inaceptable “puesta en escena” motorizada por la Sra. Presidente y su Canciller. Sin noticias de la mentada ratificación, con fecha 20 y 21 de noviembre de 2013, en reuniones mantenidas en Zúrich, el Ministro Timerman manifestó haber presentado a los representantes iraníes una nueva propuesta, en el marco del pacto encubridor, mediante la que buscó avanzar con las cuestión de las declaraciones de los imputados (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N° 279/13, Declaración de prensa leída por el Canciller Timerman en Casa Rosada, 24 de noviembre de 2013). Según informó el mismo Canciller, funcionarios argentinos se habían reunido, “...para negociar los tiempos que llevará el cumplimiento de cada punto del Memorándum de Entendimiento entre la República Islámica de Irán y la República Argentina para allanar el camino de la justicia en la resolución del atentado a la AMIA.. En ese encuentro, “...la República Argentina le entregó a la delegación iraní una propuesta que permitiría concluir el mandato del Memorándum en 12 meses luego de la conformación de la Comisión de Expertos e incluye las garantías e inmunidades que permitan al Juez argentino de la Causa AMIA realizar las indagatorias en la ciudad de Teherán. Los funcionarios iraníes se comprometieron a dar una rápida respuesta a la propuesta argentina...”, aunque nada dijeron al respecto (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°279/13, Declaración de prensa leída por el Canciller Timerman en Casa Rosada, 24 de noviembre de 2013). También se informó que: “...Timerman habría reiterado a Zarif que la interpretación de la vigencia de las órdenes de captura de los acusados no la hizo Argentina, sino la misma Interpol...” (Dinatale, Martín, “La negociación con irán, empantanada por la lista de Interpol”, La Nación, 08/12/2013). Como una suerte de disculpa que deja entrever algo aquí ya probado: la persistente vigencia de las notificaciones rojas es una contrariedad, dado que existía un compromiso a dejarlas caer. Paralelamente, también en noviembre de ese año, Timerman continuó intentando subsanar la subsistencia inesperada de las notificaciones rojas. Volvió a reunirse con Noble, a quien informó de la continuación de las tratativas de ambos países en tomo al memorándum (Interpol, Comunicado de Prensa: “La seguridad mundial, eje de la visita a INTERPOL del Ministro argentino de Asuntos Exteriores”, Lyon, Francia, 26/11/2013). La intención era clara: con su visita, Timerman estaba intentando convencer a Ronald Noble que la controversia con Irán por el caso AMIA ya estaba encausada, a través del Memorando de Entendimiento, para que cediera y dispusiera el cese de las notificaciones rojas. En enero de 2014, a días de cumplirse un año de la firma del acuerdo con Irán, el Palacio San Martín emitió un comunicado relativo al República Islámica de Irán y la República Argentina para allanar el camino de la justicia en la resolución del atentado a la AMIA.. En ese encuentro, “...la República Argentina le entregó a la delegación iraní una propuesta que permitiría concluir el mandato del Memorándum en 12 meses luego de la conformación de la Comisión de Expertos e incluye las garantías e inmunidades que permitan al Juez argentino de la Causa AMIA realizar las indagatorias en la ciudad de Teherán. Los funcionarios iraníes se comprometieron a dar una rápida respuesta a la propuesta argentina...”, aunque nada dijeron al respecto (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°279/13, Declaración de prensa leída por el Canciller Timerman en Casa Rosada, 24 de noviembre de 2013). También se informó que: “...Timerman habría reiterado a Zarif que la interpretación de la vigencia de las órdenes de captura de los acusados no la hizo Argentina, sino la misma Interpol...” (Dinatale, Martín, “La negociación con irán, empantanada por la lista de Interpol”, La Nación, 08/12/2013). Como una suerte de disculpa que deja entrever algo aquí ya probado: la persistente vigencia de las notificaciones rojas es una contrariedad, dado que existía un compromiso a dejarlas caer. Paralelamente, también en noviembre de ese año, Timerman continuó intentando subsanar la subsistencia inesperada de las notificaciones rojas. Volvió a reunirse con Noble, a quien informó de la continuación de las tratativas de ambos países en tomo al memorándum (Interpol, Comunicado de Prensa: “La seguridad mundial, eje de la visita a INTERPOL del Ministro argentino de Asuntos Exteriores”, Lyon, Francia, 26/11/2013). La intención era clara: con su visita, Timerman estaba intentando convencer a Ronald Noble que la controversia con Irán por el caso AMIA ya estaba encausada, a través del Memorando de Entendimiento, para que cediera y dispusiera el cese de las notificaciones rojas. En enero de 2014, a días de cumplirse un año de la firma del acuerdo con Irán, el Palacio San Martín emitió un comunicado relativo al ALBERTO N'IS FISCAL GtNEÓAt. acuerdo celebrado por terceros países en torno al desarrollo nuclear de Irán y aseveró: “La Causa AMIA ha cumplido 19 años sin que se haya podido esclarecer y condenar a los responsables; es por ello que con el mismo espíritu que se lleva adelante la negociación por el programa nuclear iraní, el Gobierno argentino espera resolver con la República Islámica de Irán los aspectos pendientes que le permitan a las autoridades judiciales nacionales avanzar en los pasos procesales indispensables para la alcanzar la verdad y hacer justicia en la Causa AMIA.’1'' (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°006/14, “La Argentina celebra nuevo acuerdo diplomático entre los P5+1 e Irán”, 13 de enero de 2014). Efectivamente, la aprobación por parte de Irán nunca se concretó. Nuevamente, la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas, cuando se había pactado lo contrario, primó a la hora de decidir. En concreto, hasta la fecha, no se ha producido el intercambio de las notas reversales y, en consecuencia, el tratado no ha entrado en vigencia (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°110/13, del 21/05/2013). Luce evidente que el compromiso de Timerman, por orden de la Sra. Presidente, fue gestionar el cese de las notificaciones rojas en Interpol, dado que se trataba del interés cardinal de Irán para firmar el acuerdo. El apego a la legalidad del organismo internacional de policía frustró este primer objetivo del cometido criminal de los autores de este terrible plan de impunidad. Al cabo de un tiempo, consciente de la imposibilidad de barrer con las notificaciones rojas, Timerman hizo saber a su contraparte que el fracaso de ese punto no había sido su responsabilidad y que pese a todos sus esfuerzos en ese sentido, las notificaciones rojas no cayeron. Ello no significó la desarticulación del plan de impunidad. Fuera de toda duda, el interés de Teherán giró en torno al cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. No obstante ello, cabe tener en claro tres cuestiones. Primero, este revés no implica que el interés de Irán en el acuerdo haya desaparecido por completo. Segundo, para la configuración del encubrimiento aquí denunciado resulta irrelevante el interés de Irán o su predisposición respecto de la maniobra desplegada por los autores argentinos y sus cómplices. Esto es así, porque la configuración de este tipo penal no exige el consentimiento, ni siquiera demanda el conocimiento por parte del sujeto encubierto. Tercero, este revés no conlleva la desarticulación de la operación de encubrimiento llevada adelante por altos funcionarios del gobierno argentino y demás partícipes, activada por el acuerdo y que será explicada en detalle en el acápite siguiente. En suma, la existencia de este compromiso secreto y su frustrado cumplimiento permite comprender el retraimiento de Irán en relación a este primer objetivo del plan aquí denunciado y la desconfianza que debió generar entre encubridores y encubiertos. c. l.b) Punto Quinto del Memorando de Entendimiento En torno al tema de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol resta analizar un último punto. Como ya se dijo, el memorando de entendimiento cuenta con variados mecanismos o recursos, incorporados a su letra, para llevar adelante los distintos pasos convenidos en el marco del plan de encubrimiento. Esto, como se adelantó, dota al plan de flexibilidad y adaptabilidad a distintos escenarios, dada la enorme cantidad de variables imposibles de controlar por autores y partícipes. Gracias a esta característica del texto, la cuestión del cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, de máximo interés para la parte iraní, aún puede ser implementada siguiendo la letra del memorando, aunque no de manera tan directa y simple como lo prevé el artículo séptimo. En ese sentido, aún cabe la posibilidad de conseguir dicho objetivo, pero -esta vez- a través del punto 5 del acuerdo, esto es, en el marco de las audiencias a ser llevadas a cabo en Teherán, en las cuales la “Comisión de la Verdad” creada por este tratado, entrevistará a los cinco imputados iraníes que tienen notificaciones rojas de Interpol, en presencia   Ministerio Público de la Nación de autoridades judiciales iraníes y argentinas y de los representantes de ambos estados. Nótese que de los ocho imputados iraníes cuya declaración indagatoria ha sido ordenada en la causa, en el punto 5 del acuerdo que regla las “Audiencias de Teherán” únicamente se incluyó a los imputados con notificación roja de Interpol, cuyo cese -conforme lo determinado por la prueba- era esencial para Irán y así se había acordado. No existe explicación plausible para entender por qué las autoridades argentinas aceptaron que sólo se prevean audiencias respecto de aquellos cuyas notificaciones rojas podían caer, dejando de lado a los restantes imputados iraníes con captura judicial vigente, ordenada por el Sr. Juez Federal, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral. Así, del modo	en	que ha sido redactado el	punto 5 del memorando surge que los imputados sin notificaciones rojas de Interpol (Rafsanjani, Velayati y Soleimanpour) no tienen incentivo alguno para presentarse ante la justicia. El acuerdo preserva la impunidad de facto de la que gozan actualmente y la actuación de la comisión podría garantizársela para siempre. Por otro lado, los imputados con notificación roja (Fallahijan, Vahidi, Rezai, Rabbani y Asghari) podrían presentarse ante un juez iraní, miembros de la Comisión	y	el juez argentino, sin por	ello estar sometiéndose al proceso penal nacional. Si hubiera habido	una voluntad de someter	a	todos los acusados iraníes a la acción	de	la justicia argentina, como	se	argumentó para justificar el pacto ante la opinión pública, se hubiera incluido a todos los acusados y se hubieran acordado verdaderas declaraciones indagatorias conforme la ley argentina para todos los imputados y no meras entrevistas, solo para aquellos con notificación roja de Interpol. Presente ello, corresponde resaltar la verdadera entidad de estas “audiencias” y su posible implicancia. En primer lugar, cabe tener presente que en el debate parlamentario de aprobación del acuerdo, el Canciller Timerman aseveró que la presentación de los imputados ante este conjunto heterogéneo de actores políticos y judiciales se equipara al acto de encontrarse a derecho ante autoridades judiciales en el marco de un proceso penal en trámite. En sus palabras: “El memorándum establece que las autoridades judiciales argentinas procederán a interrogar a aquellas personas respecto de las cuales Interpol ha emitido una notificación roja de captura. Esta previsión sigue estrictamente la normativa procesal penal nacional que regula la procedencia de la declaración indagatoria de los imputados...” (Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de Comisiones en el Senado de la Nación, 13 de febrero de 2013). Esto mismo ya había dicho a los medios días atrás, cuando declaró que: “Lo concreto es que los sospechosos iraníes se van a sentar en el banquillo y se someterán a la indagatoria en los términos de la ley argentina, ante un juez argentino y un fiscal argentino” (Kollmann, Raúl, “Los iraníes se someterán a la ley argentina”, Página 12, 30/01/2013). Cabe aclarar, aunque resulte redundante, que del acuerdo no surge en modo alguno que el interrogatorio esté a cargo de las autoridades judiciales argentinas como así tampoco incluye referencias expresas a la aplicación de la normativa procesal argentina en ese acto y, menos aún, habilita al juez a detener a los imputados a su disposición, si lo creyera necesario, conforme lo prevé el derecho argentino. Primero, la acusación debe estar respaldada por un juez iraní de acuerdo a lo reglado por la ley iraní, lo que colisiona con lo expresado públicamente por el régimen de Teherán, en tanto afirmó haberse asegurado de la inocencia de todos sus ciudadanos. Además, no son todos “los sospechosos iraníes” los que se sentarían en el banquillo, como señala el Canciller, sino que está previsto en el acuerdo, como ya se indicó, que se interrogue solamente a cinco de los ocho imputados iraníes. Sobra decir que se está haciendo referencia a una actividad netamente judicial que el acuerdo delega ilegalmente en la “Comisión de la Verdad”, cuyas conclusiones -como la prueba lo refiere- ya estaban acordadas de antemano. Al 8ERT0 NI FISCAL GENERAL Pero, volviendo al análisis, una vez que los mencionados imputados comparezcan ante el juez iraní, los miembros de la “Comisión de la Verdad” y el juez argentino, se podría argumentar que ya no existirían motivos legales -en principio- para que Argentina siga requiriendo a Interpol la máxima prioridad de búsqueda de estos imputados que, desde esta lógica, ya estarían presentados en el proceso seguido en su contra. Esto haría, sin más, caer las notificaciones rojas, aunque el juez nunca tuvo posibilidades concretas de interrogarlos ni detenerlos, si así lo considerase. Otro ardid para lograr la impunidad de los acusados. En efecto, como en el acuerdo no se ha garantizado de forma alguna que el juez pueda proceder a la detención de los imputados, si éste decidiera dictar su procesamiento y prisión preventiva después de la supuesta “indagatoria”, se activa la trampa: ya presentados ante la “Comisión de la Verdad”, caen las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, pero no hay forma de sujetar a proceso a los imputados, que ahora quedan más libres que antes, sin ninguna restricción a su movilidad, con una justicia atada de pies y manos. Ahora bien, cabe destacar que las audiencias de Teherán previstas en el propio memorando distan enormemente de lo que se considera una declaración indagatoria conforme la normativa procesal vigente (art. 294 y cctes. del C.P.P.) y solo pueden ser entendidas -de acuerdo con la letra del tratado- como una simple entrevista ante los comisionados, en presencia de autoridades judiciales y representantes de ambos países. Como ya se expuso, en el escenario que describe el tratado, la magistratura argentina tiene totalmente restringidas sus facultades legalmente previstas. El acuerdo no prevé que el juez argentino pueda hacer comparecer por la fuerza pública a los imputados, ni que lleve adelante el referido interrogatorio, al resguardar los derechos garantizados por la ley iraní, que -además- impide que se pueda forzar la comparecencia, fundamentalmente, ante un magistrado foráneo (punto 8). Asimismo, conforme el tratado, el juez no puede disponer su detención -de considerarlo adecuado- y/o su traslado a nuestro país. El documento tampoco garantiza la aplicación de la ley argentina en la materialización de este acto sino que, por el contrario, todo indica que la ley aplicable -por razones de territorialidad- sería la iraní. En consecuencia, es completamente falaz afirmar que los imputados se encontrarían a derecho con solo presentarse a la entrevista ante la comisión, conforme lo estipula el punto 5. Sin embargo, la amplitud y vaguedad del instrumento y las múltiples interpretaciones posibles, abrirían necesariamente un debate, con el sólido riesgo de que esta discusión se desarrolle con las notificaciones rojas ya extintas, es decir, con el encubrimiento más avanzado aún. Como puede advertirse, todo está estructurado para la impunidad, con varias alternativas posibles para lograr tal fin. c.2) Impunidad por imposibilidad de aplicación de las disposiciones del tratado Como se dijo previamente, entre los mecanismos previstos en el pacto para garantizar la impunidad de los prófugos iraníes, existe una vía que descansa en la imposibilidad de aplicar sus disposiciones, por trabas a partir de un procedimiento intrincado, que no conduce a nada y que solo diluye acusaciones y viabiliza la desincriminación, lo que está favorecido por una interminable sucesión de pasos a definir y la ausencia total de plazos que marquen su implementación. En concreto, el memorando no tiene previsto ningún plazo. No se pautaron tiempos para crear la comisión, ni para emitir sus reglas de procedimiento, ni para la remisión de las pruebas e informaciones, ni para la elaboración del informe, ni para la realización de las audiencias en Teherán. Para nada. Nada tiene plazo en este acuerdo. ¿Y por qué? Porque lo único que importa del mismo es que permita favorecer y encubrir a los imputados, garantizándoles impunidad. Por eso el acuerdo no garantiza ley ni proceso y solo garantiza impunidad. De hecho, en la propuesta de noviembre de 2013, el Canciller Timerman dijo estar buscando fijar el plazo de un año para “...concluir el mandato del memorándum...”. No obstante, en los hechos, estipuló que dicho plazo comenzaría a correr recién a partir de la creación de la comisión, lo que supeditaba un plazo cierto a una condición o circunstancia incierta y sin término temporal que la rija. Lo mismo que nada. Fue un nuevo intento por ocultar los mecanismos de impunidad del plan. Y, además, sobra decir que a la fecha, Irán no ha respondido a la supuesta propuesta (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información de Prensa N°279/13, “Declaración de prensa leída por el canciller Timerman en Casa Rosada el domingo 24 de noviembre a las 21 horas”, 24/11/2013). En suma, esta omisión en materia de plazos y lo intrincado del procedimiento previsto, también constituyen salvoconductos de impunidad, dado que permiten alegar que hubo un acuerdo de partes y así viabilizar políticamente el restablecimiento de relaciones plenas entre ambos estados, sin solucionar realmente el tema AMIA. c.3) La “Comisión de la Verdad” y la invención de una hipótesis alternativa para desvincular a los iraníes de la causa AMIA. El plan criminal desplegado tiene por fin encubrir a los imputados iraníes en la causa AMIA, contribuyendo a sustraerlos de la acción de la justicia argentina, desvincularlos de la imputación judicial que pesa sobre ellos y -de ese modo- garantizarles su impunidad y cerrar definitivamente toda investigación respecto de ellos. Esta maniobra delictiva estuvo motivada por el interés de ciertos funcionarios argentinos de acercarse geopolíticamente a Irán y restablecer las relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado. Para ello se acordó, a través de conductas evidentemente delictivas, remover el impedimento que ha obstruido la relación bilateral por años, esto es, la cuestión judicial pendiente por la causa AMIA. En este punto habrán de exponerse los elementos probatorios que demuestran que la “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en el memorando de entendimiento firmado con Irán, constituye una de las principales vías aptas para posibilitar la desincriminación de los imputados iraníes respecto del atentado contra la AMIA, sin perjuicio de su real responsabilidad en el hecho, permitiendo agotar la maniobra de encubrimiento aquí denunciada. Asimismo, se enumerarán las pruebas que demuestran que autores y cómplices, como parte integrante del plan, habían planificado y avanzado en la fabricación de una hipótesis acusatoria alternativa, falsa pero verosímil, con “nuevas” pruebas fraudulentas, para redireccionar ilegalmente la pesquisa hacia otros imputados y así desligar definitivamente a los nacionales iraníes de toda relación con el atentado, engañando de esta manera a familiares, a víctimas, a la justicia y a la sociedad toda. c.3.a) La “Comisión de la verdad ” y su verdadero rol en el plan. El esquema gestado en el acuerdo permite contar con herramientas para avanzar hacia este objetivo que, como se advierte, es mucho más amplio e importante que el simple cese de la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Así, el Memorando de Entendimiento y fundamentalmente los puntos que prevén la creación, conformación, facultades y obligaciones de la “Comisión de la Verdad” (1 a 5 y 8) están redactados de modo tal de posibilitar: 1) la deslegitimación de la investigación sustanciada ante la justicia nacional, 2) la desautorización de los funcionarios que intervinieron en ella, 3) la tergiversación de pruebas y conclusiones, 4) la desacreditación de la acusación contra los actuales imputados y 5) el redireccionamiento de la investigación hacia nuevos culpables, como siempre solicitó Irán y ahora, delictivamente fue concedido por ciertas autoridades argentinas, en un giro de ciento ochenta grados con lo sostenido por el gobierno de Néstor Carlos Kirchner y parte del de Cristina Fernández. Estas acciones, sin importar si son realizadas en forma individual o conjunta, tienen por objeto generar un salvoconducto destinado a encubrir en forma definitiva a los imputados, permitiendo que éstos eludan la acción de la justicia, con el objeto de garantizarles su impunidad y que no se los vuelva a investigar nunca más. Como ya se dijo, el pacto guarda en la amplitud de su redacción cierto grado de sutileza, para que los objetivos delictivos subyacentes no emerjan en forma grotesca a los ojos del mundo. Con ese norte, se decidió que las conclusiones de la comisión no fueran propiamente vinculantes, dado que ello hubiera sido demasiado visible. Pero en los hechos es como si lo fueran, ya que los gobiernos se comprometieron a atar “sus futuras acciones” a los descubrimientos y recomendaciones de la comisión creada, que como su nombre lo sugiere, desentrañará “la verdad”. Esto obliga al Estado Argentino y a sus distintos órganos, a atender al referido dictamen. La comisión podría, según lo habilita el acuerdo, desacreditar fraudulentamente la prueba obtenida en la causa judicial y/o incorporar informaciones o pruebas que resulten falsas o ilegítimas y, así, redireccionar la investigación o crear sospechas y suspicacias que permitan introducir “nuevas hipótesis” sobre la explosión de la AMIA, que tengan por protagonistas a “nuevos imputados” que, a la luz del dictamen de comisión, terminen siendo los “verdaderos autores” del atentado. En este rol legitimador-deslegitimador, la comisión tiene la capacidad de descartar lo actuado por la justicia, desarticulando las imputaciones, sin que exista mecanismo de revisión sobre su pronunciamiento que, una vez comunicado y aunque pudiera ser posteriormente rebatido en otros ámbitos, ya habría generado un efecto deslegitimador irreversible. Nótese que su mera creación ya constituye una flagrante descalificación a la justicia argentina que, a la luz del acuerdo, parece necesitar de avales foráneos para avanzar con sus requerimientos y procedimientos. En suma, el texto del acuerdo contiene un instrumento con la capacidad institucional de consumar el encubrimiento aquí denunciado: la “Comisión de la Verdad”. Analizada en su totalidad la letra, el espíritu y los alcances del Memorando de Entendimiento surgen los siguientes interrogantes: ¿Por qué no se previo que el juez argentino pudiera tomar declaraciones indagatorias conforme a derecho, tal como lo prevé la ley argentina? ¿Por qué si se dijo que se había logrado que los iraníes acepten la jurisdicción argentina y declaren ante nuestro juez, no se lo puso por escrito en el acuerdo? ¿Por qué no se resguardaron sus facultades judiciales para poder disponer la comparecencia por la fuerza pública de imputados renuentes y/o su posterior detención si fuera necesaria? ¿Por qué se acordó que las audiencias se llevaran a cabo en Teherán, donde impera la ley iraní y donde el fiscal de la causa tiene pedido de captura -justamente- por haber acusado a funcionarios iraníes? ¿Por qué se dice que el acuerdo es compatible con la ley argentina cuando su aplicación implica dejar de lado la normativa en vigencia, única garantía que resguarda al proceso penal de nulidades futuras? ¿Por qué no se pautó ningún plazo, pero se habilitó la comunicación a Interpol aún sin que el tratado estuviera ratificado y vigente? ¿Por qué si Irán sostiene que cuenta con pruebas sobre el caso, no se exigió en el acuerdo que las presente ante la justicia argentina? ¿Por qué se creó una comisión con la facultad de deslegitimar lo actuado por la justicia argentina y se la llamó “de la verdad”? ¿Por qué se aceptó que la justicia argentina sea examinada y juzgada por un órgano extrajudicial con facultades judiciales ilegales? ¿Por qué el Poder Ejecutivo avanzó sobre la investigación de una causa penal en trámite, y no dudó en conculcar el principio republicano de gobierno y la expresa prohibición del art. 109 de la Constitución Nacional? ¿Por qué se siguió mintiendo y diciendo que la negociación comenzó en septiembre de 2012, aun cuando las autoridades iraníes no tuvieron restricciones legales ni secretos de estado que les impidieran reconocer que las mismas se habían iniciado mucho tiempo antes? ¿Por qué se incumplió con la promesa de comunicar a las víctimas y   Ministerio Público de la Nación a los familiares sobre los avances de la negociación, previo a arribar a cualquier acuerdo? ¿Por qué se desoyó el contundente rechazo que el memorando generó en las instituciones damnificadas por el atentado y - fundamentalmente- en varios grupos de familiares y víctimas que hicieron oír su disconformidad? Y así se podría seguir con muchísimos interrogantes más. Todos estos porqués tienen una única respuesta, sencilla e institucionalmente terrible: detrás de este pacto se oculta un plan criminal dirigido a procurar la impunidad para todos los imputados iraníes, creando instancias que puedan deslegitimar completamente las acusaciones de la justicia argentina respecto de todos ellos. Con su sola letra, el memorando tiene la potencialidad de deslegitimar las conclusiones a las que la justicia argentina arribó siguiendo las pruebas obtenidas y conforme a derecho. En su texto se acordó llamar “verdad” aquello que emane de un órgano creado por poderes políticos e ilegalmente ungido de facultades judiciales. Ello, ya de por sí sumamente grave, adquiere ribetes escandalosos cuando se conocen los pormenores de la negociación, que los partícipes expusieron sin tapujos en sus conversaciones, que en el punto siguiente se detallarán. c.3.b) Nueva hipótesis. nuevos imputados y nueva prueba: el camino a la impunidad. El plan criminal ordenado por Cristina Fernández, e instrumentado principalmente por Héctor Timerman, para liberar a los imputados iraníes de la acusación emitida y avalada por la justicia argentina, tenía previsto no solo la desvinculación de la causa de los actuales prófugos, sino también que otros responsables inventados ocuparan su lugar, para cerrar el círculo de la impunidad a cualquier costo. Así, la creación de una nueva hipótesis delictiva que explique desde otra perspectiva el atentado y que, redireccione la investigación hacia “nuevos responsables”, resultó ser una pieza fundamental y de enorme utilidad en el encubrimiento. Nótese que el redireccionamiento de la pesquisa hacia nuevos responsables ha sido desde siempre la salida que ha sugerido y solicitado la República Islámica de Irán. Que se desista de acusar a sus ciudadanos y se dirija la investigación para encontrar, en sus términos, a los “verdaderos autores”. Ahora, los funcionarios y cómplices argentinos involucrados en la maniobra de encubrimiento se mostraron dispuestos a aceptar ese abordaje pero, entre ellos, reconocían la verdad: que no se trataba de encontrar a los “verdaderos” autores, sino de inventar una nueva hipótesis, conseguir pruebas que la tornen creíble, y acusar a terceros inocentes, aun cuando la responsabilidad, como señalan las pruebas judiciales, sea de quienes se encuentran actualmente imputados. Así como se ha leído. Los acusados aceptaron y realizaron su aporte para lograr este escandaloso fin, buscando vaciar de contenidos las imputaciones judiciales del mayor atentado terrorista perpetrado en nuestro país, imputando a personas que de antemano se sabía inocentes. Presente ello, en el mes de noviembre de 2012, es decir, antes que se firmara el memorando, los involucrados en el encubrimiento ya estaban trabajando en la fabricación de los “nuevos imputados” por el atentado, por supuesto, ajenos a Irán. En ese tren de acciones, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil ya se había reunido con el Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia, ex fiscal que intervino en la causa y ex juez de Instrucción, actualmente vinculado a un sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia y partícipe de la maniobra que se denuncia. Así lo relató: “...tengo un par de cosas que contarte...tuve una charla con el fiscal...El fiscal de la causa...el que estaba, no el que está ahora... El que sabe es éste que te digo... el fiscal de la causa....”. Para luego señalar que el contacto con Yrimia le habría llegado a través de Fernando Esteche: “...Y, el que me sienta es Fernando” (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012- 11-04-130024-6, CD 182). Sobre el armado de esta nueva hipótesis, falsa pero necesaria para desplazar la acusación de los imputados iraníes, Fernando Esteche concluyó: “...quieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA, por ejemplo, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla, van a querer ir construyendo el consenso de esto...'''’ y, de la conversación se desprende, que esa tarea ha quedado a cargo de la Secretaría de Inteligencia, o al menos a un sector de ella. Al construir este “nuevo enemigo”, como “no van a poder decir que fueron los israelíes”, porque -claramente- no sería creíble, entonces tenían que armar una hipótesis falsa, y hasta hablaron de involucrar a “una conexión de fachos locales” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). En un tiempo en que ni la justicia ni los familiares y víctimas del atentado sabían qué estaba ocurriendo con las negociaciones entre Argentina e Irán, estos “operadores” conocían perfectamente que se venía un cambio de hipótesis y el redireccionamiento de la investigación hacia “nuevos imputados”, que reemplazarían a los imputados iraníes, fundado en pruebas falsas. Esto era así, pues ellos eran justamente algunos de los encargados de armar la nueva hipótesis falsa para desviar a la investigación de su curso verdadero. El objetivo de generar esta hipótesis fraguada y redireccionar la pesquisa ha sido: “...la esencia del nudo, el núcleo del nudo...es la inocencia de Irán...”, y también se dijo: “...es la inocencia de Irán con la inocencia de la comunidad como conexión local...” (Comunicación del 14/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341- 10, CD 284). Por eso, planificaban: “...construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA...”, y reconocían que los encubridores “...Van a plantear un blanqueo con ustedes...”, en alusión a los iraníes (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). En igual sentido, se decía: “...creo que vamos a la limpieza nuestra...” (Conversación del 1/6/2013, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo 224753, CD 0086). Sabían también que la “Comisión de la Verdad” no había sido creada para investigar absolutamente nada, sino para legitimar la mentira que se estaba fabricando. De hecho, en conversaciones del mismo día en que se firmó el pacto con Irán, se concluyó que unas de las dos partes - Argentina o Irán- tenía que salir perjudicada por la actuación de la “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en el acuerdo. Textualmente: “...alguien va a salir con la...con la cara manchada de acá...”, a lo que Khalil, la voz de Irán en este tema, reconoció: “...Obvio, eso ya está arreglado...”, pero aclaró que no iban a ser de los iraníes y remató: “... ¡¿cómo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo?! Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa...”. (Comunicación del 27/1/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266). De una importancia relevadora resulta el hecho de que un referente de la talla de Khalil supiera, contemporáneamente a la suscripción del acuerdo, que ya estaba todo arreglado, los prófugos iraníes iban a salir desvinculados fraudulenta y definitivamente del caso por la comisión y quienes iban a salir perjudicados eran aquellos que, de la parte argentina, habían realizado las acusaciones contra los nacionales de Irán. Es más, al día siguiente a la suscripción del acuerdo el agente de inteligencia identificado como “Alian” se comunicó con Khalil y le dijo: “Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me tenías fe...'” (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). Resulta sumamente llamativo este tipo de intercambio entre un funcionario argentino y el referente de Irán, Jorge Khalil. Obviamente las cuestiones en torno al memorando y, fundamentalmente, al encubrimiento, habían sido acordadas de antemano y de allí las expresiones esclarecedoras como “yo te dije, vos no me tenías fe” y “ya ganamos” que dan cuenta que cierto sector de la inteligencia argentina, por decisión presidencial, estaba operando juntamente y en la línea de los intereses de Teherán. Asimismo, conversaron respecto a los miedos que había expresado Khalil respecto al desempeño de Timerman en las negociaciones “...o ver si no la sabe dibujar ...aparte, no la entiende...”. Pero estos temores no importaban porque fue: “...orden, orden, y orden y orden en alusión a que el canciller se limitó a cumplir las órdenes recibidas de la Dra. Fernández (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). Esta conversación también sirve para demostrar que los partícipes sabían perfectamente que era “un dibujo”, es decir, que había que diseñar hábilmente un acuerdo cuya letra no expusiera burdamente el sofisticado plan subyacente. En otra ocasión, “Alian” calculó “...Que en un año y medio tengamos las buenas noticias...”, en solapada alusión a la absolución total de los iraníes en la causa. Y aclaró: “...estamos perfecto, a nivel internacional perfecto... ” y concluyó: “...tranquilo, está CERRADO MUY ARRIBA...'"" (Comunicación del 6/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276). Cabe aclarar que ese “estamos” incluía a Khalil, es decir, a los intereses de Irán. Sin importar las evidencias, los hechos o su verdadera responsabilidad en el atentado, los ciudadanos iraníes iban a ser desvinculados de la causa, se le iba a “lavar la cara ” a Irán y eso estaba “cerrado muy arriba”, es decir, el plan tenía sello presidencial. Esto es de una gravedad institucional inusitada. La orden para ejecutar el delito provino directa y personalmente de la Presidente de la Nación y su instrumentación quedó a cargo de su Canciller, otros funcionarios de menor rango y terceros, que la investigación que V.S. lleve adelante determinará en su justo alcance y medida. No está de más reiterar que el Memorando de Entendimiento firmado entre la República Islámica de Irán y la República Argentina ha sido, ni más ni menos, que el medio seleccionado para presentar al mundo un camuflaje jurídico que disimule un sofisticado plan de impunidad para terroristas internacionales prófugos de la justicia argentina. Son concluyentes las pruebas que determinan que la autora intelectual del plan de encubrimiento para dotar de impunidad a los iraníes señalados por la justicia nacional como responsables del atentado a la AMIA fue la mismísima Presidente de la Nación Argentina, Cristina Fernández. Ahora bien, los autores y partícipes de este encubrimiento habían llegado a la conclusión de que en la actualidad existe un nuevo escenario mundial en el que ha variado el lugar de Irán. Y que este “nuevo mundo” favorecería -en cierto modo- la consecución de este plan criminal, dado que hay intereses y coyunturas que exigen acercarse a Irán, que necesitan “lavarle la cara” y demandan el surgimiento de “nuevos enemigos”. Este nuevo escenario podía contribuir a la credibilidad de la versión inventada para desvincular a los imputados iraníes de la causa AMIA. Mientras Cristina Fernández aseguraba públicamente que no iba a permitir “...que esta desgracia terrible que nos sucedió a los argentinos sea utilizada como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero internacional...” o “...para fines de la geopolítica internacional...”; uno de sus cómplices, “Alian”, reconocía a través de los canales paralelos que: . .ya estamos en otro país, es otra situación mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Existe un nuevo contexto mundial, “estamos en otro país” y se había advertido la necesidad de construir un nuevo culpable por el atentado contra la AMIA. Ya no servía imputar a los ciudadanos iraníes, aunque fueran verdaderamente los responsables del atentado, sino que se pretendía recomponer los vínculos con Irán y con la comunidad iraní local. Las pruebas así lo demuestran. Se ha revelado que: “...va a venir otra hipótesis con otras pruebas...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Es decir, las responsabilidades se iban a determinar por las necesidades políticas y geopolíticas internacionales de los autores. Poco importó lo que indica la prueba. Todo estaba arreglado: se iba a usar el caso AMIA como una pieza para saciar intereses geopolíticos en el nuevo tablero mundial. Vaya ironía las palabras de la Dra. Fernández. Y	cuando aparezca esa nueva tesis y sus pruebas falsas, se dijo que el suscripto iba a quedar totalmente descolocado “...porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas...lo que viene ahora...es una prueba contundente...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Efectivamente, sabían que para deslegitimar al abajo firmante y a la investigación llevada a cabo conforme a derecho, para avanzar con el encubrimiento de los acusados iraníes, necesitaban inventar una nueva -y falsa- hipótesis, con “pruebas nunca vistas”, nunca siquiera presentadas a la causa. Es decir, los partícipes del encubrimiento sabían que se iba a presentar una nueva hipótesis sobre el atentado, pero con “otras pruebas”, más aún, pruebas nunca vistas por el suscripto. Se habló de la fabricación de elementos probatorios falsos para buscar desacreditar la minuciosa investigación vigente y así deslegitimar la acusación que involucra a los imputados iraníes. Ahora bien, resulta una obviedad señalar que la nueva hipótesis debía parecer verosímil. En consecuencia, se decidió recurrir a ciertos individuos que habían tenido contacto con la investigación del caso AMIA, como el caso del otrora Fiscal Federal y ex Juez Nacional de Instrucción, Héctor Luis Yrimia. Este contacto tuvo por fin obtener datos objetivos de la causa que tomaran verosímil lo falso. El Dr. Yrimia intervino como fiscal en los primeros y trascendentales momentos de la pesquisa . Ha tenido acceso al expediente y ha podido contribuir con información para inventar una hipótesis con apoyo en elementos que ya se encuentren incorporados a la causa, lo que conllevaría un mayor grado de credibilidad para la versión inventada. Adviértase que en noviembre de 2012, mucho antes de la suscripción de ningún pacto con Irán, Jorge “Yussuf” Khalil ya se había reunido con el Dr. Yrimia. Así lo relató: “...tengo un par de cosas que contarte...tuve una charla con el fiscal...El fiscal de la causa...el que estaba, no el que está ahora... El que sabe es éste que te digo... el fiscal de la causaPara luego señalar que el contacto con Yrimia le habría llegado a través de Fernando Esteche: “... Y, el que me sienta es Fernando (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012- 11-04-130024-6, CD 182). Estos contactos se corroboraron en una conversación posterior, mantenida en diciembre de 2012, en la que Esteche le avisó a Khalil que “el fiscal de AMIA es de ellos, Yrimia’'' (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). “Ellos”, en alusión a un sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia. Estas referencias indican que el Dr. Yrimia respondería al mismo sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia que “Alian”, quien sostiene: “...Yrimia...es empleado mío ese...está en casi todas, ¿viste?...'’'’ (Comunicación del 7/10/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-10-07-141519- 20, CD 171). Justamente fue Femando Esteche quien sugirió a Yrimia como fuente de información para la fabricación de la nueva hipótesis “eso te puede servir bien concreto para cualquiera de las tesis distintas de....tercer país o lo que fuera, cualquiera de las cosas que vayan a resolverse va a sei-virporque es información” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Clarísimo. Hay varias hipótesis para desplazar a la acusación judicial. Se necesita elegir la mejor, las más creíble, para ello necesitan información veraz y el Dr. Yrimia ha sido una de las fuentes que se ha prestado a proveerla, justamente, porque estuvo en una posición privilegiada de contacto directo con el expediente a raíz de su función como Fiscal del caso AMIA. En suma, para la elaboración de la “nueva hipótesis”, los partícipes tuvieron acceso al Dr. Héctor Yrimia quien, a los fines del plan cuenta con las siguientes “credenciales”: 1) un conocimiento personal específico sobre la causa del atentado, por haber sido, entre otros, uno de los primeros fiscales del caso; 2) se encuentra relacionado con el sector de la secretaría de inteligencia encargado del armado de la nueva hipótesis falsa; 3) tiene relación directa con el agente iraní Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, gracias a la vinculación de éste último con Fernando Esteche; y 4) habla de ello en sus conversaciones con Jorge Khalil. No caben dudas. Yrimia se encontraba en condiciones de aportar información de primera mano de la causa. Y como la decisión de crear un “nuevo culpable” ya había sido tomada, resultó vital contar con información que se apoye en datos ya incorporados a la causa, y que permitan fabricar la más creíble de todas las falsas versiones. Así, en las conversaciones registradas se barajaron distintas ideas relativas a posibles versiones alternativas, como por ejemplo: “no van a poder decir que fueron los israelíes”; se podría culpar a “una conexión de fachos locales”; o “...ellos están denunciando que fueron ellos mismos los del autoatentado. Así, de frente va, y así empezamos a tejer otra varianteo “...si se cae la trafic, olvídate, se cayó todo	no solamente se cayó, sino que se da vuelta...”. (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226, Comunicación del 13/02/2013, abonado -3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-13-184206-28, CD 283 y Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341 -10, CD 284) Y	esa conversación permite demostrar nuevamente que todo ya había sido acordado de antemano. Cuando se sugirió como alternativa de “nueva hipótesis”: “...si se cae la trafic, olvídate, se cayó todo...no solamente se cayó, sino que se da vuelta...”, Khalil señaló: “ya está... ¿Me estás car gando?...y a está, no te puedo hablar, adelantar nada, pero YA ESTÁ TODO” (Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341-10, CD 284, el resaltado es propio). La impunidad había sido ya convenida previamente, por fuera al texto del acuerdo. En síntesis, de las evidencias obtenidas se desprende que el sector de inteligencia dependiente directamente de Presidencia de la Nación, al que responde “Alian”, se abocó a la construcción de un nuevo enemigo, de una nueva hipótesis que permitiera explicar el atentado de algún modo que desvincule a los ciudadanos iraníes acusados, en virtud del plan de encubrimiento que aquí se denuncia. Así, de los pasos que fueron siguiendo los partícipes del encubrimiento, se desprende que la construcción de la pista falsa que aleje la investigación de Teherán implicó la fabricación de pruebas que incriminen a terceros inocentes, y los convertirían en los nuevos imputados y, según todo el relato, los “verdaderos culpables”. Todo quedó en espera por la negativa iraní a firmar el Memorando de Entendimiento, porque permanecieron vigentes las notificaciones rojas. Como se dijo al inicio, la maniobra de encubrimiento conlleva no solamente desvincular por medios fraudulentos a quienes han sido judicial y fundadamente imputados de un hecho criminal, sino que también implica incriminar falsamente a terceros. El objetivo de construir esta falsa teoría alternativa ha sido contribuir a la desincriminación de los acusados iraníes y que finalice para ellos la pesadilla que comenzó en el año 2007, cuando el suscripto logró en Interpol la aceptación de las capturas con notificaciones rojas para los acusados. Los partícipes del encubrimiento así lo entendían. Prueba de ello es lo que expresaban al respecto: “...la esencia del nudo, el núcleo del nudo...es la inocencia de lrán...\o demás viene a colación...”, y también “...es la inocencia de Irán con la inocencia de la comunidad como conexión local,...'’'' (Comunicación del 14/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341 -10, CD 284). La gravedad de estas acciones es fenomenal, máxime si se tiene en cuenta que la decisión primigenia fue tomada por la más alta autoridad pública nacional e involucra a su canciller, a un Diputado Nacional, a cierto sector de la inteligencia argentina y a referentes locales ligados a funcionarios del gobierno, entre otros. Finalmente, mientras los partícipes de este hecho -algunos muy cercanos al entorno presidencial, como el caso de “Alian”, por ejemplo-, reconocían, en	privado,	que	los cambios en el escenario mundial demandaban un nuevo posicionamiento respecto de Irán, que se traduciría en la invención de nuevos responsables para el caso AMIA, con la consecuente remoción del obstáculo que, a entender de las autoridades argentinas, ha impedido la relación bilateral; por su parte, la Sra. Presidente construía un discurso oficial muy distinto a la realidad que manejaban los partícipes de su plan. En	efecto,	Cristina Fernández afirmaba públicamente: “...jamás permitiremos que la tragedia AMIA sea utilizada como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero de intereses geopolíticos ajenos'''' (Mensaje de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 10:32). Y agregaba: “No voy a permitir que esta desgracia terrible que nos sucedió a los argentinos	sea utilizada	como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero internacionar e insistía:	“Yo	no voy a permitir que nadie utilice la desgracia y la tragedia de los argentinos para fines de la geopolítica internacionar (cuenta de twitter de Cristina Kirchner, 04/03/2013 5:08 PM; Mensaje de la Presidenta Cristina Fernández a la Asamblea Legislativa con motivo de la apertura del 131° período de sesiones ordinarias del Congreso de la Nación del 1/03/2013). En este encadenado rosario de mentiras, la mandataria fue secundada -justamente- por su canciller, quien, meses antes, había emitido un comunicado desde el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores que, anunciando un cuarto intermedio en las negociaciones oficiales, rezaba: “...El Gobierno Nacional ratifica que el único compromiso es con las víctimas y el derecho de sus familiares a hallar en la verdad y en la justicia la reparación debida. Argentina reafirma que en dicho objetivo no hay lugar para intereses geopolíticos, ni propios, ni ajenos...'''' (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°360/12, del 31/10/2012, el subrayado es propio). Ni el discurso de la Presidente ni el comunicado del Canciller se ajustaban a la verdad. Ellos mismos eran los protagonistas de un plan que sacrificó la causa por el atentado a la AMIA en pos de intereses ajenos a la búsqueda de justicia. Una Presidente que, públicamente, se regodea manifestando a los sobrevivientes y a los familiares de las víctimas que busca verdad y justicia; que declara que no va a permitir que se utilice el caso AMIA en el ajedrez de la geopolítica mundial; que ha tomado cartas en el asunto porque la causa estaba paralizada, cuando en realidad, ha dado la orden de desarticular la causa y encubrir a los acusados. Da pavor, entonces, constatar que todo se trata de actuación y manipulación de hechos y personas pues, lo cierto es que esa misma Presidente ha ordenado a su Canciller, a funcionarios de su servicio de inteligencia y a personas afines a su gobierno que ejecuten un plan delictivo, decidido por ella misma, y que construyan una hipótesis falsa para terminar con la acusación a los iraníes en el expediente AMIA. d)	Indicios de un acuerdo secreto firmado con Irán por fuera del Memorando de Entendimiento Al anunciar la suscripción del acuerdo desde Adís Abeba, Etiopía, el Ministro Timerman se vio en la necesidad de aclarar:	Este acuerdo se logró en un diálogo directo con Irán y no existen cláusulas secretas ni ningún otro tema con el gobierno de ese país... ” (Declaraciones de Timerman al finalizar el acuerdo con su par de Irán para investigar el atentado de la AMIA, Casa Rosada, Presidencia de la Nación, 27/01/2013). No se entendía cuál era la razón para semejante aclaración. Se supone que este acuerdo no debería contener cláusulas secretas u ocultas. El correr de los meses le otorgaría el verdadero sentido a aquella manifestación preventiva del Canciller. En mayo de 2013, cuando Jorge “Yussuf” Khalil comunicó la desazón que había encontrado en Teherán por el tema de las notificaciones rojas, expuso llanamente lo que realmente había ocurrido, al decir: “...hay un poquito de...esto entre nosotros ...hay un poquito de desazón de allá... Desazón...si, si, si...me parece que....Me parece que el ruso este de mierda se mandó alguna...estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares  también parece...” (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-1 l-083146-8.wav, CD 0022). Las palabras de Khalil dejan entrever la existencia de otro documento firmado en el que estaba incluido el tema de la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Es decir, un documento más amplio que lo incluido en la letra del memorando de entendimiento del 27 de enero de 2013. Esto se corrobora con las declaraciones del canciller iraní Salehi quien en marzo de 2013 expresó: “...El [contenido] del acuerdo entre Irán y Argentina en relación con la cuestión de la AMIA será hecho público en el momento adecuado y la cuestión [de los imputados iraníes] está incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo...”, en obvia alusión a un pacto distinto al memorando (“Tehran insists accord with Argentina includes interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects”, Mercopress, 19/03/2013). A ello debe sumarse otro episodio revelador de la existencia de pactos secretos entre ambas partes. Hubo indicios certeros que pusieron en duda que verdaderamente se fueran a llevar a cabo las audiencias en Teherán, aun cuando las mismas ni siquiera constituyeran verdaderas declaraciones indagatorias para la ley argentina. De hecho, el vocero de la cancillería iraní, Ramin Mehmanparast, declaró: “...El tema de la indagatoria de un responsable iraní [por Vahidi] es totalmente falso...Parece que los que se inquietan por este acuerdo difunden este tipo de informaciones...” (“Irán ratificó su adhesión plena al memorándum con Argentina”, Página 12, 12/02/2013). Los medios informaron al respecto que: “...El portavoz del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Irán, Ramin Mehmanparast, dijo que la solicitud para la interrogación de algunos de los funcionarios de la República Islámica de Irán en el marco de la revisión del caso AMIA, no es cierta...” (“Mehmanparast: solicitud para interrogar a funcionarios iraníes sobre el caso AMIA, es falsa”, IR1B, 11/02/2013). Al día siguiente, el Canciller Salehi declaró: “...Hemos firmado un acuerdo con la Argentina sobre la solución del caso AMIA y las dos partes se han comprometido a ello...” (“El canciller de Irán dice que negoció durante dos años el acuerdo con Argentina”, Clarín, 12/02/2013). Entonces, para intentar aquietar la nueva polémica en ciernes, en pleno tratamiento parlamentario del acuerdo, el Ministro Timerman brindó al siguiente explicación sobre las declaraciones de los iraníes, dirigiéndose a un Senador de la Nación: “... Usted dijo que ayer el gobierno iraní negó que se vaya a interrogar a los sospechosos ¡quién lo dijo? Un vocero. ¿Sus voceros hablan por usted o usted habla por usted? Porque el canciller iraní, el doctor Salehi, una hora después, dijo que Irán va a cumplir con todos los puntos del Memorándum ¡Le cree más a los voceros que al propio canciller?...” (Palabras de Héctor Timerman, versión taquigráfica del Plenario de Comisiones, Cámara de Senadores, Honorable Congreso de la Nación, del día 13 de febrero de 2013). Pero era una falacia. Una más. Salehi no había desmentido lo que afirmó su propio vocero. Sería extraño. Su portavoz había transmitido un mensaje importante y certero. Salehi solo había reafirmado su compromiso a cumplir el pacto y ello, en modo alguno significaba que el entonces Ministro de Defensa tuviera que comparecer a las audiencias previstas en el acuerdo. Con su fallido intento de interpretar la voluntad íntima del régimen iraní mejor que los funcionarios persas, el Canciller Timerman ocultó lo que verdaderamente estaba ocurriendo: la ejecución del plan encubridor aquí expuesto. De hecho, la prueba fehaciente de la existencia de un pacto secreto entre Salehi y Timerman por el cual se acordó que Ahmad Vahidi jamás concurriera a esas audiencias, surge de la comunicación entre Jorge Khalil y Luis D'Elía que se transcribe a continuación: D’Elía: Ahí infobae está tirando que rechazaron la indagatoria de Vahidi ¿qué sabés? Khalil: No, no sé nada Luis. D’Elía: ¿eh? Khalil: No sé nada. D’Elía:	Porque viste, esto va.....justo un día antes del debate parlamentario... Khalil: Pero....eh... D’Elía: ¿No será pescado podrido eso? Khalil: Si, pescado podrido. Después hablamos personalmente y te cuento. D’Elía: Pero no me dejes... ¿por qué es pescado podrido? Khalil: Pero boludo, no puedo decirte por teléfono cómo viene la mano, pero....está dentro del marco, Luis. D’Elía: Ah, ah....ok, ok, ¿fue conversado antes? Khalil: Claro, bolas, claro. No puedo hablar por teléfono, este teléfono de mierda está re pinchado y el tuyo está más pinchado que el mío todavía. D’Elía: Pero ¿se sabía de antes?... ¿no es sorpresa? Khalil: No. D’Elía: Bueno. Khalil: Fue un...ambas partes, se sabía. D’Elía: Ah Khalil: Es más profundo todavía Luis, yo te tengo que explicar. (Comunicación del 12/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-12-100525-14, CD 282). Es decir, ya no se trataba solamente de la caída de las notificaciones rojas. También se acordó que, en la práctica, el entonces Ministro de Defensa iraní y actual prófugo de la justicia argentina, Ahmad Vahidi, jamás se sentaría a prestar declaración, sin importar lo que dijese la letra del Memorando. Ello estaba acordado entre las partes, ya había sido “conversado antes ” y, según se sugiere de la conversación, el acuerdo era “más profundo todavía Esta prueba revela, en forma contundente, la existencia de acuerdos secretos por fuera de la letra del memorando, alguno de ellos escritos y firmados, que incluyen cuestiones que no pueden trascender a la opinión pública. Ello contribuye, a la acreditación del plan aquí denunciado, dado que todo lo que abiertamente concierne al mismo ha sido -en principio- escondido del escrutinio público. e)	Mohsen Rabbani y el plan de impunidad Durante este plan criminal, los distintos avances fueron inmediatamente comunicados a uno de los prófugos de la justicia argentina, acusado por su participación en el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA y beneficiario directo del encubrimiento que se denuncia: Mohsen Rabbani. Cada paso del plan y cada mensaje que llegó a conocimiento del agente de Teherán en Buenos Aires, Jorge Khalil, fueron comunicados al imputado Mohsen Rabbani. Se han registrado comunicaciones telefónicas que constituyen insoslayables ejemplos de ello: “...hoy terminamos una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas...”, a lo que Rabbani respondió:	“...Mándame para que evalúe...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31). Así, las propuestas del gobierno argentino fueron puestas a evaluación y decisión de uno de los acusados por el atentado terrorista quien, luego de evaluarlo, contestó: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina...y también comprar armas...” (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Esto demuestra varias cuestiones. Primero, Rabbani goza de un enorme poder decisorio y peso político dentro del régimen, lo cual le ha permitido intervenir personalmente en las negociaciones con sus encubridores. Este imputado prófugo tiene capacidad de decisión en las cuestiones comerciales entre ambos Estados que, como también se ha denunciado, constituyeron un motor central para avanzar con este encubrimiento. Todo esto indica que el mismísimo Rabbani ha intervenido indirectamente -a través de intermediarios como Jorge Khalil- en las negociaciones comerciales que motorizaron, nada más y nada menos que su propio encubrimiento. Y todo ello, a espaldas del conocimiento público. Segundo y teniendo en cuenta que la reunión con el Ministro Julio De Vido fue llevada a cabo “porque lo pidió la jefa ” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 111124-8, CD 31), queda probado uno de los modos en que los mensajes y las propuestas enviadas por Cristina Fernández, a través de su Ministro de Planificación Federal Julio De Vido, del operador Luis D'Elía y del nexo con Teherán, Jorge Khalil, llegaron al imputado Mohsen Rabbani. En otras palabras, la Sra. Presidente de la Nación Dra. Cristina Fernández negoció, por interpósitas personas, con el prófugo Mohsen Rabbani, sobre distintas cuestiones vinculadas al encubrimiento que los unía en la dupla delictiva de encubridora y encubierto. Tercero. El caso aquí registrado permite demostrar que mientras públicamente la Dra. Fernández aseguraba que el acuerdo venía a contribuir con la causa judicial; secreta y clandestinamente negociaba petróleo con uno de los sospechosos del mayor acto terrorista que sufrió nuestro país. Y Rabbani, en vez de estar preocupado por su situación procesal, orquestaba la negociación por petróleo impulsada por la Sra. Presidenta, en torno a su propio encubrimiento, encarando la posibilidad de comprar armas a la Argentina. Cuarto. Esta posibilidad de comprar armas a la Argentina fue comunicada por Mohsen Rabbani a una persona de su entorno, Adalberto Assad, quien ese mismo día venía de reunirse con un funcionario del gobierno argentino, quien iba intermediar para conseguirle una reunión personal con la Sra. Presidente (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Quinto. Este intercambio telefónico revela también que Mohsen Rabbani seguía y sigue de cerca las reuniones y negociaciones que giran en torno al acuerdo que, como aquí se denuncia, tiene por norte -entre otras cuestiones- su encubrimiento personal. Gracias a Khalil, Rabbani estaba mejor informado que los familiares y víctimas del atentado, que la dirigencia judía local y que las autoridades judiciales argentinas, ninguno de los cuales, al mes de mayo de 2013, conocía estas tratativas. Hay otros ejemplos de Mohsen Rabbani negociando, enviando mensajes a sus intermediarios, para que lleguen eventualmente al despacho presidencial: '''‘...Irán quiere buenas relaciones, nosotros verdad es así, que Irán quiere buenas relaciones...Y eso que está Irán creciendo, entonces debe aprovechar lo más rápido y posible ahora que ellos quieren...”. Del mismo modo, ha recibido mensajes que responden: “...Ellos también...el gobierno también quiere tener una buena relación...”, en referencia al gobierno argentino (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Existen también ejemplos de comunicaciones con Rabbani que prueban que estaba informado de cada aspecto vinculado a su situación procesal, a la causa AMIA en general, al acercamiento de Teherán con Buenos Aires y, naturalmente, al Memorando de Entendimiento, vía para su impunidad (Comunicación del 27/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2013-02-27-125331-24, CD 297, Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31, Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 05-28-155549-2, CD 39; Comunicación del 24/11/13, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-11 -24-103813-4, CD 219 y Comunciación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-04-093431-30, CD 291). En el marco de este plan criminal, Jorge Khalil ha sido la persona de confianza de Rabbani, que le ha reportado constantemente desde Buenos Aires: “...Sheik, quédese tranquilo que yo hoy a la noche, cuando llego a mi casa, le mando un informe de todo todo lo que estoy haciendo.. ”, demostrando -una vez más- su subordinación a Mohsen Rabbani (Comunicación del 20/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-20-160302-28, CD 276). Rabbani ha reconocido este lazo en distintas oportunidades: “lo maltrato a usted en la confianza porque usted es responsable de todo” (Comunicación del 13/2/13, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-13-184206-28, CD 283 y del Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 02-14-164341-10, CD 284), o “...no mezcle más las cosas. Usted trabaja conmigo...” (Comunicación del 24/11/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-11-24-103813-4, CD 219). Además, estos contactos demuestran acabadamente que Mohsen Rabbani, desde Irán, sigue decidiendo y operando para el régimen de Teherán, enviando financiamiento para sustentar la estructura que supo construir en territorio argentino durante la década que precedió al atentado contra la sede de la AMIA y que continua sosteniéndola hasta la fecha con la asistencia de su entorno (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31, Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39; Comunicación del 19/1/2014, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo IN- 12177-20140119-003044, CD 49; Comunicación del 20/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-20-160302-28, CD 276, Comunciación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014- 02-04-093431-30, CD 291). Pero fundamentalmente, las circunstancias registradas en las comunicaciones obtenidas por orden judicial, son un ejemplo flagrante de cómo ciertas autoridades del gobierno nacional argentino han estado negociando y acordando estrategias conjuntas, intermediarios mediante, con uno de los imputados por su participación en el atentado terrorista contra la AMIA. El próximo punto detallará todas las acciones que la Sra. Presidente, el Sr. Canciller y otros partícipes del encubrimiento han llevado adelante para cumplir acabadamente con su plan delictivo. V.- Acciones para impulsar el plan criminal: a)	La campaña del descrédito El plan encubridor incluyó paralelamente una estrategia mediática y discursiva destinada a horadar la credibilidad de la justicia argentina y de los funcionarios a cargo de la investigación del atentado, achacándoles que la causa se encontraba paralizada, además de falta de objetividad y fundamentalmente permeabilidad a la influencia de intereses ajenos a la búsqueda de la verdad y la justicia. Se trató de una verdadera y, por cierto, nefasta campaña de descrédito a la actual investigación judicial del caso AMIA, en lo que ha sido otro de los medios para concretar el plan encubridor, dado que la deslegitimación de la acusación permite presentar, públicamente, y dar verosimilitud a las “nuevas hipótesis” y a los “nuevos” autores del hecho y, de esa forma, permitir la desvinculación de los acusados iraníes y, principalmente, de Teherán, de todo involucramiento terrorista en el caso. El descrédito no es inocuo, sino que contribuye a la finalidad del encubrimiento aquí denunciado. a.	1) La causa está 11armada ” Este cliché ha sido la primera punta de lanza para intentar cuestionar la certera investigación judicial argentina que ha logrado determinar, en gran medida, los responsables del atentado ocurrido en Buenos Aires el 18 de julio de 1994. Por otra parte, ha sido desde siempre la versión oficial del régimen de Teherán. Simplemente, una estrategia comunicacional y de defensa que, para la República Islámica de Irán, ha resultado exitosa. Según esta falsa premisa, existen intereses extranjeros promovidos por facciones políticas procedentes de Israel y/o Estados Unidos que han logrado influenciar y manipular a la justicia argentina para que fabrique la acusación que involucra a ciudadanos iraníes en el atentado contra la AMIA, con el objeto de deslegitimar y dañar la reputación internacional de la República Islámica de Irán, atribuyéndole la responsabilidad por un hecho de terrorismo en Sudamérica. Ninguna prueba existe de estas acusaciones hechas a la ligera. No podría haberla tampoco pues sencillamente la pretendida manipulación de potencias extranjeras nunca sucedió y las conclusiones de la investigación son, ni más ni menos, que el resultado del análisis de la prueba que obra en el expediente. Que la evidencia reunida guste o no a determinado sector o país es una cuestión absolutamente ajena al suscripto. Ahora bien, a partir de la puesta en marcha del plan de encubrimiento por parte de ciertas autoridades del gobierno argentino, la campaña de descrédito, hasta ese momento exclusivamente orquestada desde Teherán, experimentó un sutil giro que le ha otorgado una impronta distinta. Las más altas autoridades de la nación, incluida la Presidente y el Canciller, lejos de oponerse a la retórica iraní parecieron adherirse a ella y contribuyeron a aumentar las expresiones de deslegitimación y descrédito. Anteriormente, Luis D'Elía había actuado como vocero local de esta versión, pero ello le costó su puesto en el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner, que no permitió que ninguno de sus funcionarios pusiera infundadamente en duda las conclusiones del Poder Judicial y el Ministerio Público Fiscal. D'Elía nunca dejó de comunicar esta versión falsa y deslegitimadora. En ese contexto, mientras D'Elía operaba aseverando que intereses extranjeros habían logrado influenciar y manipular a la justicia argentina para fabricar la acusación contra Irán, la Sra. Presidente reforzaba la retórica a través de su cuenta de “twitter”, manifestando: “...jamás permitiremos que la tragedia AMIA sea utilizada como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero de intereses geopoliticos ajenos” (Mensaje de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 10:32). Esta frase fue celebrada por el mismo D'Elía, quien destacó que la Sra. Presidente había hecho referencia a la utilización del tema AMIA en cuestiones geopolíticas de otros Estados (“Causa AMIA: Para D'Elía, los acusados iraníes van a ser sobreseídos”, Infobae, 1/3/2013). Consterna constatar que la causa AMIA, a contramano de lo expresado por la Presidente Fernández, fue usufructuada como pieza de cambio para lograr el restablecimiento de la relación comercial bilateral con la República Islámica de Irán, en función de un cambio en la visión geopolítica. a.	2) La causa está paralizada Con el objeto de lograr el apoyo de la opinión pública y el aval parlamentario, estratégicamente se intentó presentar al Memorando de Entendimiento -pieza importante en el plan encubridor- como la única alternativa posible para avanzar en la causa, como el camino que había que transitar, no porque fuera ideal -nadie podría creer que lo fuera- sino porque ya no quedaban otras alternativas y no había nada que perder. De esa manera, se pretendió instalar la idea de que la causa judicial por el atentado se encontraba completamente paralizada desde hace años. Con esta afirmación, totalmente falsa, se buscó estratégicamente crear el ánimo en el público de que el memorando aportaba la única posibilidad de avanzar en la causa y que, si bien no era ideal y ciertos aspectos eran perfectibles, era mejor que la parálisis del expediente. En suma, falso pero se dijo que no se perdía nada intentando esta opción. SCAL Para sostener este argumento, Timerman dijo: “...Por primera vez hay un compromiso por escrito de Irán...para que la causa “AMIA ” pueda salir de la total parálisis actual en la que se encuentra. Repito, la total parálisis actual en la que se encuentra...” y, luego, aclaró que se refería al “....proceso judicial en curso, que no ha tenido avances de ningún tipo en los últimos años” y advirtió a los legisladores: “Serán ustedes quienes decidan si la causa avanza o sigue paralizada''’ y posteriormente agregó: “La causa está paralizada desde el año 2006” y “Le recuerdo que van 19 años sin que hayamos logrado un avance significativo” (Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Asuntos Constitucionales y de Justicia y Asuntos Penales de la Cámara de Senadores desarrollado el 13 de febrero de 2013). Similares expresiones repitió ante el plenario de comisiones de la Cámara de Diputados (cfr. versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Justicia y Asuntos Constitucionales de la Cámara de Diputados, Congreso Nacional, desarrollado el 26 de febrero de 2013). Por su parte, en su discurso ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, la Sra. Presidente afirmó: “...la causa está estancada, desde hace 19 años no se moviliza...” (Discurso de Cristina Fernández, 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2013). Y meses antes, al elevar el acuerdo con Irán al Congreso para su aprobación, había aseverado en Cadena Nacional: “Este Memorándum que hemos acordado es un paso adelante para destrabar una causa que hace 19 años está paralizada...’''’ (Discurso de Cristina Fernández, Cadena Nacional del día 08/02/2013). En marzo de 2013, la Sra. Presidente escribió en las redes sociales: “Teníamos que destrabar esto”, en alusión a la causa AMIA (ver twitter del 04/03/2013 5:05 PM) y ante la Asamblea Legislativa: “...mi compromiso es intentar destrabar esto...''’’ (Mensaje de la Presidente Cristina Fernández a la Asamblea Legislativa con motivo de la Apertura del 131° período de sesiones ordinarias del Congreso de la Nación, 01/03/2013). En línea con la Presidente y el Canciller, otros funcionarios y representantes cercanos al entorno presidencial hicieron declaraciones de igual tenor. El entonces Senador Daniel Filmus sostuvo que el acuerdo “destraba la causa AMIA”, la cual “no se mueve desde 2006” y agregó que si bien: “no se puede garantizar el éxito cien por cien del memorándum, se sabe que la causa así congelada va directo al fracaso” (“Duro cruce de acusaciones entre Timerman y García Moritán”, La Nación, 19/02/2013). El Senador Nacional Miguel Ángel Pichetto, también afirmó en su alocución que “...la causa tiene una parálisis desde el año 2006...” (Versión taquigráfica del plenario de comisiones del Honorable Senado de la Nación, 13 de febrero de 2013). Por lo demás, tamañas falsedades obligan a quien suscribe a enumerar aquí, aunque sea en forma somera, los significativos avances que ha tenido el expediente desde el año 2006, fecha en la cual se dictaron las órdenes de captura internacional que fueran avaladas por amplia mayoría en la Asamblea General de Interpol en noviembre de 2007. Al año siguiente, 2008, se concluyó la labor que dio lugar a la denuncia por otro encubrimiento verificado en este caso, que beneficiara al imputado de Alberto Jacinto Kanoore Edul y que actualmente se encuentra en etapa de juicio oral. A fines de 2008 se dictaron los embargos preventivos contra las propiedades de los acusados, resultando en la inhibición registral de algunos bienes que Mohsen Rabbani posee en nuestro país. En 2009 la Fiscalía a cargo del abajo firmante emitió un nuevo dictamen relativo al atentado. Allí se plasmó el trabajo relacionado con la identificación del coche bomba utilizado en el ataque y se explicó en detalle el funcionamiento de la célula terrorista de Hezbollah que actuó en la ejecución material del hecho. Incluso se pudo establecer la identidad y la participación del jefe de dicho grupo operativo, el libanés Samuel Salman El Reda, a quien se le atribuye haber coordinado la llegada y la partida, las  Al BERTO NISM .:!SCA'- ó'  Ministerio Público de la Nación operaciones de logística y las demás actividades desplegadas por el grupo operativo encargado de ejecutar la fase final del atentado. Sobre este sujeto también se dictó orden de captura nacional e internacional y la máxima prioridad de búsqueda de Interpol. En ese pronunciamiento, se determinó que El Reda era un miembro activo del Hezbollah libanés, de una probada vinculación con destacados personajes radicados en la Triple Frontera, pertenecientes a esa organización. La labor de esta Unidad Fiscal también logró demostrar que El Reda conocía, cuanto menos desde 1987, la Ciudad de Buenos Aires y al imputado Mohsen Rabbani, y que su inserción en el medio local se fortaleció con su casamiento en 1989 con una mujer argentina: Silvina Sain. Esta vinculación con Buenos Aires y, fundamentalmente, con Mohsen Rabbani, sumada a la pertenencia de El Reda al Hezbollah, permitió trazar un puente eficaz entre la agrupación a nivel regional y el entonces gobierno de la República Islámica de Irán, cuyos máximos responsables políticos fueron imputados por el atentado. La prueba reunida reflejó que, para el año del atentado, Samuel Salman El Reda residía en la Ciudad de Foz de Iguazú, pero que habitaba alternadamente entre esa localización y la vivienda de sus suegros en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires. Tal alternancia entre los domicilios de Brasil y Argentina fue aprovechada por el nombrado para desarrollar sus tareas, ya que no llamaba a sospecha en razón de sus contactos familiares. A su vez, se logró probar que El Reda estuvo en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires en diversas épocas, y más precisamente, para la fecha próxima a la ejecución del atentado; como así también que el nombrado deliberadamente omitía dejar asentados sus movimientos migratorios, con el único objetivo de dificultar eventuales investigaciones y el seguimiento de sus pasos, y en lo que respecta al atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, dicha ausencia de registro de sus comprobados traslados de un país a otro solo pudo ser entendida como una actividad enmarcada en la función que llevó adelante en esa operación. Otra circunstancia acreditada por esta fiscalía, en lo que hace particularmente al protagonismo de El Reda en la ejecución del ataque contra la mutual judía, es su intervención en las comunicaciones telefónicas que efectuó, ya que teniendo en cuenta a quiénes las realizó, desde dónde y cuándo las hizo, pudo concluirse que en tales contactos el nombrado transmitió información indispensable para la ejecución del hecho y cumplió una función de coordinación en la llegada y la partida, las operaciones de logística y las demás actividades desplegadas por el grupo operativo, ya sea respecto de los restantes agentes involucrados en la operación que, como él, actuaron a nivel local, como con quien lo hacía desde la zona de la Triple Frontera mediante un abonado celular a nombre de André Marques. Tales comunicaciones fueron extrictamente necesarias e imprescindibles para que la operación concluyera de la manera en que lo hizo, al punto que el operativo no hubiera podido arribar a su fase final de no ser por la intervención de El Reda en los momentos y desde los lugares donde la llevó a cabo. En relación a estas comunicaciones telefónicas, se tuvo en cuenta, en primer lugar, que las mismas fueron efectuadas desde lugares estratégicos, en función del atentado (terminales aéreas desde las que ingresó y egresó, cuanto menos, parte de los ejecutores del plan, como así también locutorios cercanos al objetivo). En segundo lugar, que fueron llamadas dirigidas, en algunos casos, a abonados correspondientes a centrales de comunicaciones de Hezbollah en Beirut (República del Líbano), como así también al abonado a nombre de André Marques, cuyo usuario se trató de un militante activo de Hezbollah, que también tuvo a su cargo la coordinación de acciones y agentes desde la Triple Frontera. Y en tercer y último lugar, se consideró también que los contactos se produjeron del Io al 18 de julio de 1994, habiéndose probado previamente que el abonado a nombre de Marques solo había recibido comunicaciones desde nuestro país entre esas fechas, ni antes ni después, lo que significa que ese teléfono se activó durante un período determinado y con un objetivo concreto: coordinar las tareas desarrolladas con el fin de atentado contra la sede de la AMIA. En ese dictamen, quedó probado que los dos primeros llamados al abonado a nombre de André Marques -Triple Frontera- se registraron el 1 de julio, desde cabinas localizadas en el Aeropuerto Internacional de Ezeiza, y el último, el 18 de julio, desde otra ubicada en el Aeroparque Metropolitano Jorge Newbery, tan solo dos horas antes de que estallara el artefacto explosivo que destruyó el edificio de la AMIA. La circunstancia de que tanto el primero como el útlimo llamado registrado hayan sido realizados desde sendos aeopuertos llevó a concluir que se había informado al miembro activo de Hezbollah que operaba a nombre de André Marques, tanto la entrada como la salida de integrantes del grupo operativo que llevaron adelante la etapa final de la misión. En definitiva, la labor de la Unidad Fiscal logró demostrar de manera sólida y contundente que Samuel Salman El Reda tuvo un papel determinante en el marco del apoyo local con el que contó la operación de atentar contra la sede de la AMIA. Asimismo, en ese dictamen se	brindó un extenso informe, de más de cien	páginas,	acerca de las tareas de	esta Unidad Fiscal tendientes a individualizar la carrocería que se usó para el armado del coche bomba que explotó en la AMIA. Luego de la aplicación de adecuados filtros para depurar los extensos listados estudiados y un riguroso análisis posterior, se logró reducir el número posible de camionetas a cuatro unidades, entre las que -y así se concluyó- se encuentra la utilizada para el armado del coche bomba. A partir	de 2010 y a raíz de los pronunciamientos de la Corte Suprema	de	Justicia	de la Nación y de la	Cámara Nacional de Casación Penal del año anterior, en relación a la situación procesal de Carlos Telleldín, se comenzó la tarea de revisión de los elementos probatorios que surgían en contra del nombrado, lo que desembocó en un nueva solicitud de elevación ajuicio respecto de Telleldín, en el mes de agosto de 2012. En 2013, en virtud de la actividad investigativa realizada por esta fiscalía, que incluyó la obtención de testimonios en el extranjero, y de la prueba recolectada en los dos años anteriores -justamente relacionada con actividades ilegales de agentes al servicio del régimen de Teherán- se emitió un nuevo pronunciamiento de más de 500 páginas, en el cual se estableció la modalidad del régimen iraní para infiltrar varios países de Sudamérica e instalar allí estaciones de inteligencia destinadas a cometer, fomentar y patrocinar actos terroristas, en consonancia con sus postulados de exportación de la revolución. La obtención de esta información ha sido central para contextualizar, regional y estratégicamente, el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, así como también para acreditar con mayor detalle el rol del imputado Mohsen Rabbani en dicho ataque. En este dictamen, se demostró que el contexto en el que se llevó adelante el atentado contra la mutual judía, no se trató de un hecho aislado, sino que resultó ser un engranaje de un entramado mucho mayor, dominado por la política de penetración iraní en la región. Paralelamente a todas estas líneas de investigación y sus correspondientes pronunciamientos, la Unidad Fiscal se encuentra diariamente abocada a la profundización de la pesquisa sobre el atentado, y ello queda plasmado en el cuerpo principal de la causa y, actualmente, en 27 legajos que corren por cuerda y se encuentran en pleno trámite. Es útil recordar que el Sr. Canciller tomó conocimiento, a poco tiempo de asumir su función ministerial, esto es, a mediados de 2010, que - entre los distintos frentes de la pesquisa- se estaba avanzando en una nueva línea de investigación relacionada con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani, su rol y su red de contactos a nivel regional, que luego desembocaría en el pronunciamiento de mayo de 2013. El Ministro dijo haber aportado un dato a la fiscalía sobre esta línea de investigación. Se refería a una alerta del servidor “google”, que había recibido por correo electrónico. En sus palabras, Timerman declaró: “...pude conectar que un atentado que se frustró en Estados Unidos al aeropuerto JFK involucraba a Mohsen Rabbani, el que era agregado cultural de la embajada de Irán en Buenos Aires. No lo sabía ni Hillary Clinton ni la gente que investiga acá. Ahora hay una conexión entre un atentado que se frustró en Estados Unidos y el de la AMIA...” (Cibeira, Fernando. “Hay que relacionarse sin intermediarios” Reportaje a Héctor Timerman, Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Página 12, 9/01/2011). De hecho, en sus presentaciones ante las comisiones parlamentarias del Congreso Nacional en ocasión en que se discutía la aprobación de memorando de entendimiento, Héctor Timerman recordó: “(...) el fiscal le va a decir quién le proveyó la principal prueba que tiene en este momento contra la República Islámica del Irán. Y se va a llevar una sorpresa porque fui yo. Yo sí cooperé en la investigación (...) Concretamente, esa prueba fue la que lo habilitó a él a un montón de averiguaciones que ojalá algún día podamos presentarlas en un juicio... ”N (versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Justicia y Asuntos Constitucionales de la Cámara de Diputados, Congreso Nacional, desarrollado el 26 de febrero de 2013). Es decir, el Sr. Timerman tenía conocimiento fehaciente de avances concretos en la causa y lo reconoció ante el Congreso Nacional. Sin embargo, tres meses después, cruzaba los desiertos sirios para contactarse con Irán y negociar la suspensión de las investigaciones a cambio de retomar el flujo comercial entre Estados, sin dudar luego en justificar este curso de acción afirmando en repetidas ocasiones que la causa estaba “paralizada”. Esta falacia quedó más expuesta aun el 29 de mayo de 2013, cuando la fiscalía a cargo del suscripto, como se adelantó párrafos atrás, emitió un extenso pronunciamiento -justamente, en relación con la línea de investigación conocida por el Canciller Timerman- en el que se expusieron hechos y pruebas que permitieron saber en forma más acabada el contexto político y regional en el que tuvo lugar el atentado contra la sede de la 14	Se refiere a la conexión entre el imputado por el caso AMIA: Mohsen Rabbani, y al actualmente condenado a prisión perpetua Abdul Kadir (fs. 133.113/133.416 de los autos principales). AMIA y, en particular, el rol de Mohsen Rabbani en el mismo (fs. 133.113/133.416). Al conocerse este documento, el Canciller varió su anterior postura y declaró: “No he visto mucho de novedoso”, en un intento por deslucir las averiguaciones del Ministerio Público, sin advertir que su demérito desacreditaba el aporte del que tanto se había vanagloriado ante los legisladores nacionales y que hasta -por su relevancia- había comunicado a la Secretaria de Estado norteamericana Sra. Hillary Clinton (Pisani, Silvia, “El Congreso de EEUU invitó al fiscal Nisman por su informe de Irán”, La Nación, 14 de junio de 2013). Finalmente, aseverar que “no hay nada que perder” constituye un nuevo engaño argumentativo destinado a justificar el camino del memorando de entendimiento que, como hoy ya se sabe, es el camino de la impunidad de los acusados iraníes por el atentado contra la AMIA. Cabe tener presente que pende sobre la causa la posibilidad de que, nuevamente, sea acribillada de nulidades si se avanza con acciones procesales no previstas por la ley y contrarias a la Constitución Nacional y los principios de derechos público previstos en ella. Es falso que no haya riesgos. En los hechos, como se verá, ya se han producido perjuicios, pues terceros países han cesado, a partir de la firma del acuerdo, en el envío de información. Concluyendo, lo único que necesita ser destrabado en esta causa es la firme negativa de Irán a extraditar a sus nacionales, para ponerlos a disposición de la justicia argentina. El memorando de entendimiento está lejos de solucionar este problema. La causa judicial no necesita “destrabarse” y -menos aun- cabe aseverar de forma irresponsable y falaz que la misma se encuentre paralizada desde el año 2006, como se dijo. Semejantes afirmaciones sólo pueden motivarse en lograr el desprestigio de la justicia argentina, en convalidar el memorando y -como se pudo determinar ahora- en avanzar con el plan encubridor en curso. b)	La campaña del engaño: La tergiversación mediática de la realidad procesal del expediente AMIA que la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller llevaron adelante en tomo al proceso de negociación con la República Islámica de Irán fue necesaria, aunque no suficiente. Debió desplegarse, además, toda una artillería de falsedades, de promesas que los funcionarios nombrados sabían perfectamente que nunca cumplirían, de puestas en escenas y demás estrategias comunicacionales falaces, cuyo único objetivo ha sido predisponer favorablemente a la opinión pública en relación con la negociación con Irán y, en particular, respecto al Memorando de Entendimiento, con el fin último de encubrir a los acusados y desvincularlos de la legítima acusación que pesa sobre ellos. Con ese norte, los encubridores han mentido sobre el momento en que verdaderamente se habían iniciado las negociaciones, sobre la entidad de las cuestiones negociadas y sobre cuál de las partes había propiciado e impulsado el acercamiento. Por los mismos motivos, se ocultó la predisposición que evidenciaron los representantes argentinos para dejar a un lado la justicia en el caso AMIA en favor de la agenda comercial, así como por razones geopolíticas, falseando -de ese modo- los verdaderos motivos del pacto, es decir, los intereses subyacentes a esta decisión. Por ello también se recurrió a intermediarios clandestinos y a reuniones “pantalla” para avanzar con la negociación secreta. Por ello se desmintió y se cuestionó a la prensa cuando comunicó circunstancias de la negociación que se habían pretendido mantener en secreto. Por ello se atacó a ex funcionarios del gobierno que confirmaron la existencia de antecedentes al pacto que, justamente por sus implicancias ilegales, no habían prosperado en el pasado. Por ello, se afirmó falsamente, y con conocimiento de esa falsedad, que la causa judicial estaba paralizada, que no había otra salida ni nada que perder al apoyar al memorando. Estas fueron, en líneas generales, algunas de las acciones positivas que Cristina Fernández, Héctor Timerman y demás partícipes de este plan de encubrimiento llevaron adelante como parte de la campaña de descrédito. Ya se han detallado los modos en que la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller intentaron justificar la negociación con Irán diciendo que la causa se hallaba paralizada, cuando bien sabían que no era así. Ahora se detallarán sus siguientes aportes al plan delictivo. Conociendo que el Memorando de Entendimiento se trataba simplemente de un disfraz jurídico para camuflar el encubrimiento de los prófugos iraníes, la Sra. Presidente lo presentó como un “logro histórico”. El día en que se firmó, en su cuenta oficial de “Twitter”, anunció: “Histórico: Después de casi 19 años del atentado AMIA se logra, x Io vez, instrumento legal de DERECHO INTERNACIONAL, entre Argentina/Irán ...Histórico: Porque se garantiza el derecho de debido proceso legal, principio fundamental del derecho penal internacional ...al conformarse comisión de verdad de cinco juristas internacionales de reconocido prestigio...Ninguno de ellos podrá ser nacional de ninguno de los 2 países. Imprescindible STANDARD de INDEPENDENCIA...Histórico:	Porque	autoridades judiciales argentinas podrán por Io vez interrogar a quienes Interpol ha emitido notificación roja...Histórico: Pq el acuerdo entre Argentina/Irán deberá ser tratado y ratificado por parlamentos de ambos países. Alto standard institucional. Histórico: Porque Irán no estaba obligado por ninguna resolución o instrumento del derecho internacional ...ni ningún organismo multilateral -x ej. ONU- a dialogar con Argentina y mucho menos a firmar un acuerdo. Histórico, porque jamás permitiremos q la tragedia AMIA sea utilizada como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero de intereses geopolíticos ajenos...” (Mensajes de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 de horas: 10:26 a 10:32). Con estas palabras, pretendió instalar mediáticamente la noticia desde el entusiasmo de una “victoria histórica”, manteniendo oculto el plan de encubrimiento orquestado para viabilizar políticamente un acercamiento geopolítico e intercambio comerciales de Estado a Estado con Irán. Continuó cumpliendo su rol en el plan criminal al negar las especulaciones que circularon apenas se conoció el acuerdo, que acusaban a las autoridades del gobierno nacional de haber actuado en virtud de intereses comerciales. La Sra. Presidente dijo en su mensaje de elevación del anteproyecto de ley de aprobación del memorando al Congreso Nacional que: “...Se quiere presentar el acuerdo como una especie de argucia para “iniciar ” el comercio con Irán. Lo cierto es que ese comercio existe desde 1990 y, salvo los años 2004 y 2005, ha sido superavitario...” (Mensaje Presidencial N°173 de elevación al Congreso Nacional del anteproyecto de ley sobre el Memorando de Entendimiento entre Argentina e Irán). Es cierto que el flujo entre privados de ambos países venía incrementándose, pero el verdadero interés radicaba en restablecer las relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado. Muchísimas son las comunicaciones telefónicas registradas que dan cuenta de ello en los niveles más altos del gobierno. Son cosas bien diferentes el comercio entre privados que los acuerdos entre Estados. Entonces, argumentar por una situación nunca responde por la otra. Por lo demás, cabe recordar las palabras de quien fuera Canciller de Néstor Kirchner, Rafael Bielsa, cuando afirmó que Cristina Fernández “...le dice a los familiares que los que comercian son las empresas y no el Estado. Me parece un argumento pelotudo, me fastidia mucho porque era un tema sagrado para Néstor...”, y agregó: “Cuando era canciller, hablar de venderle o comprarle a Irán era casus bellí\ (el resaltado es propio, Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013). En este engaño, Cristina Fernández fue secundada con énfasis por el Canciller Timerman, quien en varias oportunidades afirmó que el pacto no tuvo ninguna motivación económica y para demostrarlo, señaló: “Me ofende que Ud. invente lo de los intereses económicos....¡Cómo voy a hacer algo que está prohibido por las Naciones Unidas?...porque si Ud. supiera, hubiera leído las sanciones de las Naciones Unidas, y se daría cuenta que es imposible lo que Ud. está planteando, pero como Ud. no leyó las sanciones de las Naciones Unidas, simplemente repite lo que escucha por ahí....no puede haber intereses económicos ...porque hay sanciones económicas impuestas por las Naciones Unidas, de las cuales la Argentina es suscripta, que impiden el comercio con Irán más allá del que se está realizando , que es en granos, y eso no lo hace el gobierno argentino...lo hacen las empresas privadas ....yo les pedí que no lo hagan...” (Tenembaum, Ernesto, Tierra de Locos, entrevista a Héctor Timerman, 18/02/2013). En otra oportunidad, aseveró: “... ¿Por qué no puede vender el petróleo Irán? Por sanciones. Entonces, ¿cómo Argentina le va a comprar?...Hay sanciones. Hoy, no se puede comprar petróleo...” (Piqué, Martín. “Si se lleva adelante el memorándum, se activa la causa y comienza el juicio”, Tiempo Argentino, 17/02/2013). Lo cierto es que, a excepción de un conjunto de insumos relacionados con el plan nuclear iraní, no existe óbice legal que impida intercambios comerciales de Estado a Estado entre Argentina e Irán. Todas las resoluciones que el Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas ha dictado impidiendo a los países miembros a comerciar con la República Islámica de Irán se han referido artículos, materiales, equipos, bienes y tecnologías relacionadas con el enriquecimiento, reprocesamiento de minerales nucleares o agua pesada, o con el desarrollo de sistemas de vectores de armas nucleares13.Una nueva mentira del Sr. Timerman, que viene a engrosar la larga lista de engaños de los que debió valerse para intentar -con escaso éxito, por cierto- ocultar el delito del que fue partícipe. De hecho, el 16 de diciembre de 2010, en el marco de la 40a Cumbre del Mercosur celebrada en Foz de Iguazú, se anunció la suscripción de un convenio de libre comercio con Irán (Levinas, Gabriel, op. Cit., pag. 238). Esta circunstancia fue posteriormente desmentida por el canciller, quien explicó: “...Es falso, una mentira, una infamia que el Mercosur esté siquiera pensando hacer un Tratado de Libre Comercio con Irán...Lo que firmamos es un Acuerdo General de Preferencia, donde cualquier país que es miembro puede decir ""yo me anoto ”. Irán dijo ""yo me anoto ”, pero no 15	Resoluciones del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU N° 1385, 1686, 1737, 1747, 1803 y 1929 de no proliferación de annas nucleares. se anotó...” (“El fantasma de Irán y el reconocimiento a los palestinos se metió en el escenario político argentino”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 16/12/2010; “Timerman calificó como infamia la información sobre un acuerdo entre el Mercosur e Irán”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 16/12/2010). Además, y esto es fundamental, ante las consultas sobre la relación comercial con Irán, el Canciller Timerman explicó: “...Irán es parte del Grupo de los 77 al que adhiere Argentina y los 10 países que firmamos este acuerdo de preferencias arancelarias. Por lo tanto, no hay ninguna clase de restricciones...” para comerciar con Irán. (Gosman, Eleonora, “Mercosur: anuncian un acuerdo de libre comercio con Palestina”, Clarín, 16/12/2010; Levinas, Gabriel, op cit, pag. 238; Eliaschev, José “Pepe”, “Desinteligencias”, Perfil, 18/12/2010). Es decir, poco tiempo antes de la secreta cumbre de Alepo, el mismo Héctor Timerman ya había sostenido públicamente que no existían restricciones para comerciar con Irán, país con el cual hasta se podía establecer un trato preferencial en los intercambios. Incluso luego de la reunión de Alepo, en abril de 2011 y en ocasión de su visita a Israel, en una conferencia de prensa que brindó junto con su par israelí Avigdor Lieberman, Timerman afirmó: “...no existe ningún problema de comerciar con Irán. Argentina no tiene ningún embargo contra Irán. Irán no tiene ningún embargo contra Argentina...” (Levinas, Gabriel, op. cit. págs. 247/248, 269, 282; “Joint press conference with FM Lieberman and Argentine FM Timerman”, Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 04/04/2011). Luego de firmado el pacto, como surge de lo detallado párrafos más arriba, el Canciller no tuvo reparos en afirmar exactamente lo contrario de lo que venía diciendo. Otro ejemplo de este tipo de afirmaciones falaces por parte del Sr. Canciller tuvo lugar en ocasión del tratamiento parlamentario del acuerdo cuando, para justificar el pacto -y la “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en el mismo-, hizo afirmaciones completamente inexactas sobre las vicisitudes del trámite de extradición del ex embajador iraní en Argentina para la época del atentado, Hadi Soleimanpour, ante las autoridades del Reino Unido. En efecto, ante el plenario de comisiones en el Senado de la Nación, el 13 de febrero de 2013, el Ministro Timerman declaró: “...el pedido de extradición ordenado por la Argentina del ex embajador iraní Hadi Soleimanpour fue desechado por la justicia británica debido a la inexistencia de pruebas...que Interpol se negó a emitir una circular roja por considerar que ya había sido detenido y sobreseído y liberado por falta de pruebas...que las pruebas producidas por el entonces juez de la causa el doctor Galeano para solicitar la extradición del ex embajador iraní al momento del atentado fueron desechadas porque según las autoridades judiciales de un tercer país, en este caso el Reino Unido, no alcanzaban ni para iniciar el proceso de extradición...'’'’ (Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Asuntos Constitucionales y de Justicia y Asuntos Penales de la Cámara de Senadores desarrollado el 13 de febrero de 2013). En suma, Timerman afirmó que la “falta de pruebas”, que la “inexistencia de pruebas’’’’ había llevado a las “autoridades judiciales de un tercer país”, en concreto, a la “justicia británica’’’ a sobreseer y liberar al diplomático persa, y que eso -además- había derivado en que Interpol se niegue a emitir una nueva notificación roja respecto de este sujeto cuando, vuelto a ser imputado por el Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, se libró renovada orden de captura internacional en su contra. Pero, una vez más, los hechos estaban alejados de las palabras. En el año 2003, cuando la causa aún tramitaba ante el ex Juez Juan José Galeano, Soleimanpour fue detenido provisoriamente en el Reino Unido, con miras a su extradición, en virtud de una orden de captura que entonces se encontraba vigente. El diplomático iraní solicitó, y así se le otorgó, libertad bajo fianza, para esperar fuera de prisión el trámite de extradición. En esa oportunidad, el juez británico hizo algunas apreciaciones sobre la cuestión probatoria, pero aclaró que era prematuro pronunciarse sobre el tema, porque la justicia argentina tenía dos meses para solicitar formalmente la extradición y presentar las evidencias del caso. En otras palabras, se estaba transitando la etapa de arresto provisorio y todavía no se había iniciado propiamente el juicio de extradición. Y	aunque la justicia argentina cumplió con su parte, llegado el momento, fue el Subsecretario de Estado del Reino Unido quien decidió no dar curso al juicio de extradición de Soleimanpour, que no se pudo sustanciar, por razones de índole político no expresadas en la decisión y en virtud de una prerrogativa legal prevista en el tratado de extradición que rigió el caso. En suma, si no se pudo lograr la extradición de Soleimanpour en aquel momento fue por decisión política, y no judicial, y ésta no se motivó en la poca solidez probatoria de aquella acusación, como aviesamente se quiso hacer creer a la opinión pública, sino que fueron razones políticas no expresadas las que llevaron a esa decisión. Soleimanpour no fue nunca sobreseído por la justicia inglesa, como se dijo. Esto fue también advertido por la Cámara Federal y expuesto en el fallo que declaró inconstitucional al Memorando de Entendimiento con Irán, y a su ley aprobatoria (Voto del Dr. Eduardo G. Farah, CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 “AMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N°6- Secretaría N°11). Todas estas falacias argumentativas conforman la campaña de engaño, ingrediente importante del plan de impunidad. Así, la mendacidad y el doble discurso han sido la regla en este asunto. Todos los involucrados mienten deliberadamente y, para colmo, en cuestiones que son fácilmente comprobables. De allí se concluye que la gravedad de las acciones a ocultar - el encubrimiento en favor de extranjeros prófugos, del peor atentado terrorista de la historia argentina- eclipsa los medios para hacerlo. Dicho llanamente, es tan terrible lo que se debe ocultar que no se presta atención a los medios empleados en ese objetivo. Un cambio de declaración, una mentira, un engaño premeditado no tienen ni punto de comparación con la perspectiva de que se descubra el plan encubridor. b.	l) Manipulación de las víctimas v de los familiares de las víctimas del atentado. Además de falsear la realidad, mintiendo sobre el verdadero estado procesal de la causa AMIA, sobre el inicio de la negociación con Irán, sobre el contenido de las posteriores reuniones que fueron públicas y sobre el real sentido y alcance del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado; los autores de este encubrimiento no trepidaron en manipular vilmente tanto a las instituciones judías afectadas por el atentado como a los sobrevivientes y a los familiares de las víctimas que perecieron en la explosión. El objetivo de esta deleznable actitud era el mismo de siempre: ganar el apoyo de estos actores en particular y de la sociedad en general para implementar, sin que nadie sepa, el plan de impunidad. En efecto, apenas se tomó conocimiento de la suscripción del memorando con Irán, tanto las instituciones judías como las agrupaciones de víctimas y familiares de víctimas del atentado coincidieron en señalar que no habían sido previamente informados ni mucho menos consultados de que -efectivamente- se firmaría un acuerdo con Irán y, menos aún, de los contenidos del mismo (“El acuerdo con Irán sorprendió a los familiares de víctimas del ataque a la AMIA”, Infobae, 27/01/2013). En ese sentido, las autoridades de la AMIA hablaron de un “memorando inconsulto” y señalaron que: “la propuesta aparece firmada, un hecho del que no hemos sido informados”. Dijeron: “este memorando nos sorprende a toda la ciudadanía el pasado 27 de enero, jamás fue consultado, ni siquiera comentado” (Borger, Guillermo en: “La AMIA advirtió un momento difícil, tras el acuerdo entre Argentina e Irán”, La Nación, 3/2/2013; “Presidente de la AMIA prometió no bajar los brazos y se comprometió a evitar que la causa por el atentado causa en la nulidad”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 4/3/2013). Por su parte, los representantes de la DAIA afirmaron haber tomado conocimiento del acuerdo en el mismo momento que el resto de la opinión pública y aclararon que la institución no fue consultada previamente ni participó en la redacción del documento (Schlosser, Julio en: “LA DAIA reconoció que hay un resquemor en la comunidad judía por el acuerdo que la Argentina firmó con Irán”, Itongadol, 4/2/2013). De hecho, la novedad les llegó por la cuenta oficial de “twitter” de la Sra. Presidente e, inmediatamente, por los medios de comunicación masiva (Mensajes de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 de horas 10:26 a 10:32, transcriptos en párrafos previos; “Vía Twitter: La Presidenta sorprendió al anunciar un acuerdo con Irán por la AMIA”, El Cronista Comercial, 28/01/2013). Ello generó un inmediato resquemor, dado que la Sra. Presidente se había comprometido públicamente, en su discurso de septiembre de 2012 en Naciones Unidas, a consultar previamente cualquier propuesta formulada por Irán. Recuérdense sus palabras: “tengan la certeza de que esta Presidenta no va a tomar ninguna resolución respecto de ninguna propuesta que le sea formulada, sin consultar PREVIAMENTE con quienes han sido las víctimas directas de esto. Y, al mismo tiempo también, con las fuerzas políticas con representación parlamentaria en mi país, porque esto no lo puede decidir una sola fuerza política...'''’ (Discurso de Cristina Fernández ante la 67a Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, de fecha 25 de septiembre de 2012, el resaltado es propio). Esta promesa nunca fue cumplida y, en rigor de verdad, se trató de una manipulación de tantas que protagonizó la Sra. Cristina Fernández en su recorrido delictual. Asimismo quedó al descubierto la brutal diferencia con el modo en que en el pasado se había manejado esta cuestión con la dirigencia comunitaria y -principalmente- con los familiares y víctimas del atentado. Al respecto, Rafael Bielsa señaló: “Estábamos en permanente contacto con los familiares y la comunidad, informándolos de todo....Cada paso que dábamos, cada memorándum que enviábamos, lo consultábamos con todos, porque era una cuestión muy sensible y estaba siempre el fantasma de las ofertas...'’'’ (Dobry, Hernán, “Cancilleres K: el acuerdo con Irán ya había sido rechazado”, Perfil, 23/02/2013). En ese contexto, quedó evidenciado que aquella incumplida promesa presidencial había tenido por objeto preservar el apoyo que, hasta entonces, tenía en gran medida la gestión de la Dra. Fernández en relación al caso AMIA, dentro de las entidades comunitarias y los grupos de familiares y víctimas del atentado. En la misma línea debe anotarse el tratamiento parlamentario por el que se aprobó el memorando. El citado trámite parlamentario nada tiene de “previo a toda resolución”, ni de “consulta sobre una propuesta”, sino que es el medio posterior para convalidar legislativamente una propuesta ya aceptada y firmada. Por otra parte, la aprobación del memorando tuvo lugar en el ámbito del Poder Legislativo, que no constituye el espacio de actuación, vinculación y/o consulta del Poder Ejecutivo con los familiares de las víctimas, aun cuando algunos de ellos hayan podido concurrir a las sesiones y/o hayan hablado en instancia de comisión. Además de todas estas obviedades que ratifican el incumplimiento de la promesa, no se le dio ninguna entidad a las opiniones adversas al acuerdo, cuando representantes de fuerzas políticas opositoras, las instituciones comunitarias y varios de los grupos que engloban a familiares y víctimas se pronunciaron en contra de la aprobación del acuerdo, expresando numerosas objeciones. Para sostener esta afirmación, basta recurrir a los dichos de varios de los familiares de las víctimas del atentado. Sofía Guterman declaró: “Nadie nos informó para decirnos que teníamos que anotarnos. Nadie nos dijo nada. Me sorprendió mucho...No pensé que iban a apurar tanto el trámite, pero evidentemente la carrera se terminaba y tenían que llegar a la meta propuesta...Me repugnó cuando Pichetto dijo 'apuremos que la presidenta dijo que se termine(Sofía Guterman, “Se está haciendo todo lo posible para que Irán salga triunfante de esto”, Radio JAI, 14/02/2013). Por su parte, Laura Ginsberg afirmó: “...Uno esperaría que el Congreso fuera un ámbito de reflexión, Timerman imprimió, como también  6	En alusión a Femando Esteche. 7	En alusión al Ministro Julio De Vido.   Ministerio Público de la Nación lo senadores del oficialismo, las características de un ambiente pobre, chicanero y vulgar...” y en alusión al debate, señaló: “...estuvo en manos de Timerman y del gobierno, porque la intención de ellos era apurar rapidito la ley...”. Finalmente, sentenció: “...Lo único que el gobierno quiere es sancionar lo antes posible esta ley, que significa un punto final para el tema de la AMIA...” y resumió: “...Lo de ayer fue miserable...” (Laura Ginsberg, “Sobre el cruce en el debate por el memorándum: Lo de ayer fue miserable”, La Razón, 14/02/2013). Finalmente, un grupo de familiares que reúne a Luis Czyzewski y Mario Averbuch, entre otros, denunció no haber podido expresar su opinión en el plenario de comisiones realizado en el Honorable Senado de la Nación (“Familiares de las víctimas del atentado a la AMIA piden participar en el plenario de Diputados”, Agencia Judía de Noticias, 22/02/2013). Además, no se consultó previamente a nadie. Las víctimas y sus familiares se enteraron por los medios de la firma del acuerdo y de su contenido. No tuvieron ningún tipo de participación durante todo el proceso de negociación que, como ya se comprobó, fue secreto. En palabras de la dirigencia comunitaria judía: “...No hemos recibido ni siquiera una llamada telefónica anticipando esta posibilidad. Nos hemos sorprendido, pleno domingo, Día Internacional del Holocausto, plenas vacaciones, plena feria judicial. Nos enteramos por los medios... Concretamente fuimos absolutamente sorprendidos por este memorándum...” (Borger, Guillermo. Versión taquigráfica del plenario de comisiones del 13 de febrero de 2013). Queda claro que dijeran lo que dijeran los familiares y víctimas del atentado, la decisión estaba tomada. El memorando había sido firmado sin consulta previa y debía ser aprobado a cualquier costo. Ello era estrictamente necesario para la consecución del plan criminal pergeñado. A ello debe agregarse que la mentira presidencial sobre las consultas previas fue acompañada por una rotunda denegación de información a los familiares de las víctimas del atentado, pese a que la enviada, como anexo, formando parte integrante del Memorándum de Entendimiento que se someterá a la aprobación...” parlamentaria (“AMIA informa a la opinión pública sobre las conclusiones de la reunión mantenida con el canciller Timerman en el día de ayer”, Prensa Judía, 30/01/2013; “La AMIA pide que las promesas de Timerman sean anexadas por escrito al acuerdo original”, Clarín, 30 de enero de 2013). Por su parte, la agrupación “Memoria Activa” también emitió un comunicado que rezaba: “...Memoria Activa concurrió el martes 29/1 a una reunión convocada por el canciller Héctor Timerman en la sede de la AMIA. En la misma el canciller aclaró los términos del acuerdo en relación a los siguientes puntos, que pasan a ser las bases innegociables del mismo y que serán ratificadas por el gobierno argentino por escrito: 1-Los imputados serán indagados en Teherán bajo el código penal procesal de la República Argentina por el juez y el fiscal de la causa AMIA. 2- Las alertas rojas y pedidos de captura de Interpol de los imputados se mantendrán vigentes...” (Comunicado de Memoria Activa a la opinión pública, del 31 de enero de 2013). En declaraciones a la prensa, Adriana Reisfeld de “Memoria Activa”, agregó: “Se habló de estoy Timerman dijo que así iba a ser. Se comprometió a estos puntos” (Cappiello, Hernán, “Timerman se molestó con la AMIA por sus exigencias”, La Nación, 1/2/2013). Y	las comunidades judías de todo el país expresaron -entre sus preocupaciones y demandas relativas al memorando- que ""en ninguna instancia de este proceso habrá riesgo de que pierdan vigencia las circulares rojas emitidas por Interpol"" (“La AMIA pide al gobierno que rehaga el memorándum con Irán”, La Nación, 1 /2/2013). Sin embargo, el Canciller negó haberse comprometido con víctimas, familiares y dirigentes comunitarios a tramitar un anexo al acuerdo (“La AMIA pide al gobierno que rehaga el memorándum con Irán”, La Nación, 1/2/2013; Cappiello, Hernán, “Timerman se molestó con la AMIA por sus exigencias”, La Nación, 1/2/2013). Ahora bien, en ambos casos, tanto la promesa presidencial de consultar a los familiares, víctimas y fuerzas políticas con representación parlamentaria, ANTES de avanzar en un acuerdo con Irán, como el compromiso inmediatamente desmentido por el canciller en relación a la confección de un anexo al memorando, son ejemplos públicos y evidentes de las maniobras de manipulación realizadas por funcionarios públicos involucrados en el encubrimiento aquí denunciado, destinadas esencialmente a construir respaldo para el acuerdo con Irán. Las acciones de la Presidente y el Canciller descriptas en este punto constituyen ardides que deliberadamente buscan engañar. Todo con un único y delictivo propósito: lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados y el cese de toda actividad jurisdiccional en su contra, para viabilizar el objetivo mediato: comerciar libremente a nivel estatal y asociarse geopolíticamente con la República Islámica de Irán sin soportar reproche alguno por parte de la sociedad argentina. Resumiendo, para llevar a buen puerto el acuerdo con Irán y lograr la impunidad de los acusados, se tuvo que incumplir la promesa de una consulta previa a cualquier acuerdo y el compromiso asumido para negociar un anexo al convenio. Se hizo creer que se buscaría el consenso de todo el arco político para avanzar en un pacto, pero -en los hechos- se desoyeron las múltiples y extendidas opiniones contrarias al memorando. Y como se verá en el acápite siguiente, se articularon puestas en escena para mostrar falsos avances diplomáticos ante la sociedad argentina. b.	2) Puestas en escena. Luego del discurso presidencial con motivo de la apertura del período de sesiones de la 68°Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, la Dra. Fernández reclamó fuertemente a las autoridades iraníes que respondan a las solicitudes argentinas en relación al pacto firmado varios meses atrás, (cfr. Discurso de Cristina Fernández, 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2013). Ningún representante iraní estuvo presente en la sala para escuchar a la Dra. Fernández y, a diferencia de ella, el Presidente Hassan Rohani ni mencionó el tema en su discurso. Claros indicios, a esa altura de los acontecimientos, del exiguo interés de Teherán en el acuerdo firmado con nuestro país, una vez cerrada la posibilidad del cese de las notificaciones rojas. Por lo pronto los reclamos mencionados en el parágrafo que antecede fueron realizados la noche del día martes 24 de septiembre de 2013. Según dijo Timerman, dos días después, el jueves 26, la diplomacia argentina recibió un llamado del canciller iraní para concertar un encuentro el sábado 28 (Miri, Ignacio, “Timerman dijo que Irán aprobó el pacto por la AMIA, pero aún no rige”, Clarín, 29/09/2013; “Timerman se reunirá con su par de Irán en la ONU”, Prensa Argentina, 26/09/2013). “Acabo de recibir un llamado del canciller Javad Zarif para reunimos el sábado por el tema AMIA”, anunció Timerman en diálogo con periodistas en Nueva York (“Argentina e Irán reactivan el diálogo para avanzar en la causa”, La Capital, 27/09/2013). Otros medios transcribieron las siguientes palabras del canciller: “Hace unos minutos hemos recibido una llamada de las autoridades de la República Islámica de Irán solicitando tener una reunión en el marco de las Naciones Unidas entre los dos cancilleres para tratar el tema del memorándum...” (Cibeira, Femando “Cara a cara para dialogar sobre el memorándum”, Página 12, 27/2013). Además, el Canciller declaró que el objetivo del encuentro era: “...conocer el estado actual del memorándum de acuerdo a la legislación iraní, es decir, si fue aprobado por el Congreso o no. Si fue aprobado por el Congreso, entonces, establecer el marco con el cual vamos a formal izar¬la fecha de conformación de la Comisión y al mismo tiempo el viaje de las autoridades judiciales a Teherán...Y si no fue aprobado, cuándo se aprobará...” (“Timerman se reunirá con su par de Irán en la ONU”, Prensa Argentina, 26/09/2013; Cibeira, Femando “Cara a cara para dialogar sobre el memorándum”, Página 12, 27/9/2013). Así, se transmitía a la ciudadanía la inquietud y expectativa por saber qué dirían los iraníes luego del público y fuerte reclamo de la Sra. Presidente. De su discurso se desprendía que Irán debía confirmar si el acuerdo estaba aprobado, cuándo se conformaría la “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en su letra y cuándo viajarían las autoridades judiciales argentinas a las audiencias de Teherán. Mientras tanto, una diplomacia paralela conformada por canales de negociación y comunicación alternativos entre ambos gobiernos, actuaba para que la realidad se acomode a los intereses de los encubridores. Por orden de Cristina Fernández y Héctor Timerman, el viernes 27 de septiembre de 2013, un día antes del encuentro con la contraparte iraní, Luis D'Elía llamó a Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, manifestando: “...tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar para allá urgente, antes de mañana...Estoy en la Casa de Gobierno ahora...Vayamos a la Embajada...no hay asunto más importante que éste, créemelo...” (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-103753-14, CD 161). Presidencia de la Nación quería comunicarse con Teherán con suma urgencia, un día antes del encuentro de cancilleres y a través de los canales no oficiales. El mensaje no fue transmitido por el Palacio San Martín a la cancillería iraní. No se comunicó Héctor Timerman con Mohammad Javad Zarif Khonsari. No podía hacerse de esa manera. Sino que el mensaje salió del despacho presidencial de la Dra. Fernández, llegó a Luis D'Elía, a Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, al Encargado de Negocios Iraní en Buenos Aires, y de allí a Teherán. Secreto. Oculto. Completamente inaudito. Propio del plan criminal llevado adelante. En efecto, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil llamó a la Embajada de Irán y avisó que necesitaba ver al Encargado de Negocios en forma urgente: “...yo necesito sacarlo quince minutos, necesito darle un mensaje...es urgente, urgente...es del gobierno argentino, mandaron un mensaje para él ...llamaron recién de Casa de Gobierno...'''’ (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-104209-26, CD 161). Además, Luis D'Elía urgió la presencia de Khalil dado que, además, quería que diera “aviso a otro lado”, así, agregaría: “necesito que hables con el sheik allá”, en referencia a Mohsen Rabbani, aclarando en otro llamado: “...mirá que es muy groso lo que tengo, eh!...me lo pidió...” (Comunicaciones del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-09-27-114113-28, CD 161; Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-104245- 8.txt, CD 161). Una vez más el imputado Mohsen Rabbani era avisado al instante de los mensajes de Cristina Fernández. El Encargado de Negocios de Irán le transmitió a Khalil que no quería que esté presente en la reunión con “la gente del gobierno”, dado que quería ver a Khalil en privado (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-104852-14.wav, CD 161). Khalil reportó que había coordinado, entonces, para que el diplomático iraní recibiera a D'Elía: “...yo le hablé al embajador'6 y no hay problema, lo recibe...”, por Luis D'Elía (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-110437-18, CD 161). La cadena de “intermediarios” se activó a pedido de la Dra. Fernández. ¿El motivo? Khalil lo explicó así: “...Necesita que el gobierno iraní junto con el gobierno argentino mañana anuncie la conformación de la “Comisión de la Verdad”...que por favor lo anuncien en conjunto mañana en la reunión...que se defina el día de la reunión de la “Comisión de la Verdad” y también que se defina el día, en el mes de enero, en que el juez argentino pueda viajar a Teherán...” (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161). Como resaltó D'Elía:	“...que	mañana lo anuncien los dos...” (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-114113-28, CD 161). Estas conversaciones demuestran tres cuestiones. Primero y una vez más, el interés imperioso de los encubridores en avanzar con el plan. El tema no figuraba en la agenda de Irán en Nueva York: “...la reunión se hace de apuro a pedido de Cristina...” y “ ...fíjate que Rohani ni habló del tema AMIA en su discurso...” (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11-3238-4966, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161).   Ministerio Público de la Nación Algunos de los contactos que participaron de estas tratativas entendieron, un día antes de la cumbre de cancilleres y sin conocer aún la respuesta de Teherán, que las autoridades iraníes no iban a conceder lo que secretamente solicitaba la Presidente Fernández y, además, que la actitud pública de Argentina de “apurar” a los iraníes era pour la galerie o “para la galería” (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11-3238-4966, Archivo B-1009- 2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161). Segundo, quedó en exposición que hay cosas que se conversan y arreglan de antemano sin comunicar a la opinión pública, a la que se busca engañar con puesta en escenas, falsas negociaciones, acuerdos ocultos, etc. Se entiende que se maneje con reserva un tema delicado. Pero la reserva, en este caso, es únicamente para engañar y para ocultar actividades ilícitas. Es para aparentar y no ser descubiertos. Tercero, estas pruebas ponen en evidencia que, por detrás, sin que nadie lo sepa, estaba todo arreglado y, en realidad, no existía ningún secreto ni expectativa, porque las autoridades argentinas sabían lo que ocurriría en la cumbre. “Pour la galerie” se haría aquello que terminaron acordando con Teherán previamente, aunque no fuera exactamente lo que se había pedido desde el despacho presidencial de la Casa Rosada, como surge de las comunicaciones aquí transcriptas. A través del canal paralelo por el que también se ejecutó este encubrimiento, Luis D'Elía llamó a su amigo Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, referente orgánico de Irán en el país, para transmitirle un mensaje que debía llevar a Teherán, sobre lo que la Presidente necesitaba que los iraníes anuncien en el encuentro, para engañar a la ciudadanía respecto del estado de situación real. La reunión del sábado 28 de septiembre de 2013, entre Timerman y el flamante Canciller iraní Mohammad Javad Zarif Khonsari, en la sede de Naciones Unidas en Nueva York, fue una mise en scene, es decir, una puesta en escena para que la gente crea verdaderamente que estaban negociando algo y/o que la diplomacia argentina estaba obteniendo resultados en función de la reciente demanda pública de la mandataria. Como ya se indicó, lo cierto es que las autoridades argentinas habían pedido -por canales no oficiales- un anuncio conjunto de ambos cancilleres y definiciones sobre varios temas, algo, aparentemente, demasiado ambicioso. Pero los iraníes, en lo que pudo ser “...un gesto...hacia el gobierno argentino en vísperas de elecciones...” (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-09-27-135214-22, CD 161), aceptaron meramente que se anuncie pública, aunque no conjuntamente, que Irán había aprobado el memorando con el aval del Consejo Superior de Seguridad Nacional y del Líder Supremo, aunque esto no fuera cierto. Nuevamente “pour la galerie”. Aquel sábado 28 los cancilleres tuvieron dos reuniones, con consultas intermedias a sus mandatarios. No se intercambiaron las notas reversales. El tratado no entró en vigor. No se definió ningún plazo respecto de la “Comisión de la Verdad” ni sobre las audiencias de Teherán. No hubo ningún anuncio conjunto. Ninguna autoridad iraní declaró nada oficialmente. Luego de las reuniones, el Canciller Timerman dialogó con la prensa y explicó que su par le había asegurado que el memorando estaba aprobado internamente por el Consejo Nacional de Defensa, con el Presidente de Irán a la cabeza y el aval del Líder Supremo. Y que equipos técnicos se reunirían en Suiza en la primera quincena de noviembre para ir viendo la implementación del acuerdo (Miri, Ignacio, “Timerman dijo que Irán aprobó el pacto por la AMIA, pero aún no rige”, Clarín, 29/09/2013; Pisani, Silvia, “Irán le confirmó a Timerman que ya aprobó el acuerdo”, La Nación, 29/09/2013 “Timerman anunció nueva reunión con Irán en noviembre”, Prensa Argentina, 28/09/2013; “Timerman ratificó la aprobación del memorándum de entendimiento con Irán y un nuevo encuentro”, Télam, 28/09/2013; “Irán aprobó el memorándum de entendimiento por la AMIA”, Página 12, 28/09/2013). IRNA, la agencia oficial de noticias de la República Islámica informó sobre el encuentro de ambos cancilleres, pero nada dijo sobre la aprobación del memorándum, sino que se limitó a comunicar que se había 16	Así denominan al Encargado de Negocios apostado en Buenos Aires, por ser -actualmente- la persona de mayor jerarquía dentro de la Embajada.     convenido una nueva reunión para noviembre en Ginebra, Suiza. (IRNA, “Zarif continúes talks with counterparts in New York”, 29/09/2013). Es decir, Irán aceptó reunirse y no desmentir las declaraciones de Timerman pero no fue más allá. De hecho, en Irán, la pretendida aprobación del acuerdo fue meramente informada por el “Tehran Times” que tomó como única fuente de esta novedad a la agencia de noticias oficial argentina TÉLAM. Inédito. El diario persa “Tehran Times”, uno de los más importantes de la nación iraní, en su tarea de informar sobre una decisión adoptada por el gobierno de su país refirió como fuente a la agencia oficial de noticias de otro país, Argentina (“Argentina says Irán committed to probing 1994 bombing”, Tehran Times, 29/09/2013; “Timerman ratificó la aprobación del memorándum de entendimiento con Irán y un nuevo encuentro”, Télam, 28/09/2013) ¿Cómo puede ser que la fuente no sea iraní? ¿Cómo puede ser que para un acto de gobierno decidido y producido en Teherán la fuente del “Tehran Times” sea TÉLAM? En este episodio, como en otros, la actuación del canciller había sido maquillaje mediático, pues todo se sabía de antes. Todo se preparó, se negoció y tergiversó antes. En secreto. Por los canales paralelos y paraoficiales que, como se demostrará a continuación, han sido muy importantes en la consecución del encubrimiento aquí denunciado. Mientras la República Argentina estaba pendiente del resultado de la reunión del Canciller en Nueva York, en la Casa Rosada ya sabían qué ocurriría y que todo era una puesta en escena. Ello no importaba, lo relevante fue lo que se transmitió luego a la opinión pública y, obviamente, el engaño. Ahora bien, todos los elementos descriptos en este acápite deben ser interpretados de forma integral y en función de una cuestión central: los encubridores necesitaron contar siempre con el mayor apoyo posible por parte de la opinión pública para facilitar la implementación de su plan criminal. Dadas las especiales características del encubrimiento aquí denunciado y el rol institucional de muchos de sus autores y partícipes, el peso de la opinión pública en el respaldo al Memorando de Entendimiento y la necesidad de que la misma permanezca ajena a los verdaderos objetivos perseguidos mediante el citado instrumento, han signado acciones y reacciones públicas de los involucrados. En suma, viene al caso enumerar las falsedades y demás maniobras ardidosas en que han incurrido la Sra. Presidente y su Canciller para ocultar su plan criminal: 1) la causa está paralizada, 2) no se permitirá que el caso AMIA se transforme en una pieza de ajedrez de la geopolítica mundial, 3) con la aplicación del Memorando de Entendimiento no hay nada que perder, 4) el acuerdo no contiene cláusulas secretas, 5) el instrumento permite recibirle declaración indagatoria a los imputados iraníes, 6) no hay ningún interés comercial detrás de este acuerdo, 7) no se puede comerciar con Irán porque está prohibido por la ONU, 8) se consultará a los familiares y víctimas previo a tomar cualquier decisión sobre las propuestas iraníes, 9) se firmará un anexo al Memorando de Entendimiento que asegure la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas, 10) la negociación con Irán se inició a instancias de Teherán, 11) el proceso de negociación comenzó en septiembre de 2012. c)	Otros caminos para favorecer el plan de impunidad La campaña para motorizar el encubrimiento no fue solamente mediática, se han obtenido evidencias que exponen las intenciones de los partícipes de este encubrimiento de remover al suscripto de su cargo al frente de la Unidad Fiscal que investiga el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, como una forma más de allanar el camino para el cumplimiento de sus objetivos criminales. Una de las vías elegidas para este caso fue utilizar la falsa hipótesis armada desde cierto sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia para culpar por el atentado a nuevos autores inventados como el mecanismo para desacreditar la labor del suscripto. Es decir, si se lograba imponer esta falsa teoría como la verdadera, ello implicaba, por añadidura, que la labor de la Unidad Fiscal había sido errada o peor aún, malintencionada. En consecuencia, podría sostenerse con mayor facilidad un intento de remoción de quien firma esta presentación. Justamente, las pruebas han revelado que: “...va a venir otra hipótesis con otras pruebas”. Y en ese escenario, se dijo que el suscripto va a quedar totalmente descolocado por la nueva hipótesis fundada en pruebas falsas que, obviamente, no estaban agregadas a la causa. Se dijo: “...va a hacer culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas ...lo que viene ahora... es una prueba contundente...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Efectivamente, se sabía que para deslegitimar al abajo firmante y a la investigación llevada a cabo conforme a derecho, para avanzar con el encubrimiento de los acusados iraníes, necesitaban inventar una nueva -y falsa- hipótesis, con “pruebas” nunca vistas, nunca presentadas en la causa. De estas expresiones de “Alian” se desprende que para quienes se encuentran detrás de este encubrimiento, un objetivo clave ha sido remover al suscripto, mediante el descrédito personal y/o la deslegitimación de la pesquisa, a partir de -como surge de sus planes- hipótesis inventadas con pruebas falsas. Existen otros indicios que dan cuenta del interés de remover a este denunciante. Como se dijo, el descrédito de la investigación resulta un paso necesario para el plan, cuya ejecución se vería enormemente facilitada -sin lugar a dudas- por la ausencia de quien tiene a su cargo la investigación de este acto de terrorismo internacional. Khalil sabía porque “Alian”, su contacto en la Secretaría de Inteligencia, con acceso al entorno presidencial, le había dicho que planeaban crear “otra hipótesis con otras pruebas'’’’ y así, descolocarían al abajo firmante (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Entonces, con motivo de la pronunciamiento emitido desde la Unidad Fiscal “AMIA” el 29 de mayo de 2013 que, justamente, profundiza la prueba y brinda nuevos elementos sobre la participación de funcionarios iraníes en el atentado, Khalil aseveró: “...son los últimos manotazos de ahogado que puede tirar este chabón...’’’' (Conversación del 1/06/2013, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo 61.30373.20130601.225511, CD 86). El 16 de julio de 2013, a dos días del aniversario del atentado, quien suscribe expuso en la sede del Hotel Intercontinental de la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, ante un amplio auditorio que incluyó legisladores nacionales y porteños, periodistas y expertos en derecho internacional, en el marco de una jornada organizada por el Congreso Judío Latinoamericano . En referencia a esa exposición Jorge Khalil, quien conversaba con Alejandro José Salomón, dijo: “...estoy escuchando a Nisman... ¡cómo nos mató un poquito!...si, si, nos mató bien, eh...para variar, si, si, para variar nos mató bien...”, y Salomón le respondió: “...bueno, cada vez es menos creíble y marcha la intervención de ese muchacho...” (Comunicación del 17/07/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-17-134828-28, CD 89). Estas palabras se corresponden con ciertos trascendidos de aquellas fechas que referían la posibilidad de intervención de esta Unidad Fiscal (“Estudian intervenir la fiscalía del caso AMIA”, Perfil, 14/07/2013). Claramente subyace el objetivo de alejar al suscripto del cargo que viene ejerciendo y, consecuentemente, de la causa AMIA, lo que se condice con las expresiones referidas en el párrafo previo. Ello beneficiaría sin duda al plan encubridor que aquí se detalla y se denuncia. De los hechos enumerados en este apartado queda evidenciado que se lanzó una feroz campaña de descrédito hacia la investigación del caso, destinada a horadar la versión judicial de los hechos, y se la combinó con una campaña de engaño compuesta por falacias, puestas en escena, mentiras, desmentidas y falsas promesas, se manipuló a víctimas y familiares del atentado, su buscó separar al suscripto de su cargo al frente de la Unidad Fiscal que investiga el atentado, a fin de evitar que la opinión   ALBERTO Ministerio Público de la Nación	F|SCAL GEN£RAL pública conozca la entidad del verdadero objetivo encubridor que subyace al pacto con Irán. d)	Gestos y otros favores: ingredientes para facilitar el plan de impunidad. Los autores de este encubrimiento siempre tuvieron claro que una parte importante del mismo consistía en contar con la buena predisposición de las autoridades del régimen iraní y de sus referentes locales, dado que la aquiescencia, o mejor aún, el respaldo de estos actores, contribuiría a facilitar el avance del plan criminal, por las peculiares características del mismo. Naturalmente, la cuestión relativa al cese de las notificaciones rojas, como ya se demostró, era un interés crucial para Teherán y generó fricciones entre encubridores y encubiertos. Por otra parte, el establecimiento de canales de comunicación y negociación paralelos a los oficiales, también resultó un recurso central para favorecer el acercamiento y el buen entendimiento con Teherán, en pos del avance del plan delictivo. No obstante ello, las acciones destinadas a conseguir la buena predisposición de los iraníes, y así facilitar el tránsito del plan criminal, no estuvieron limitadas a estos dos puntos, sino que se ha podido constatar la concesión de una serie de favores concretos, como por ejemplo: facilitación de gestiones, promesas de puestos de trabajo y acceso a contactos importantes; todos ellos procurados a los referentes locales del régimen, como gestos de buena voluntad y cercanía, destinados a favorecer -en última instancia- el plan de impunidad. Estos “favores” fundamentalmente demuestran el interés de la Sra. Presidente en mantener en buenos términos su relación con los contactos iraníes, para poder avanzar con su plan delictivo. Y en esa línea deben ser interpretados. El 28 de mayo de 2013, Adalberto Assad tuvo una reunión en el Ministerio de Justicia, que inmediatamente reportó a su referente Jorge “Yussuf” Khalil: “...recién salí hace un rato del Ministerio de Justicia...tengo unas novedades lindas ...necesito verte...necesito tener una charlaen el marco de una serie de visitas protocolares que distintos representantes que responden a Irán tuvieron en organismos oficiales, entre los que se encuentra el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores (Comunicación del 28/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28- 141635-26.txt, CD 39). Este acercamiento y la novedad de contar con “puertas abiertas” en los despachos más importantes del país llegó inmediatamente a conocimiento del prófugo Mohsen Rabbani, quien -como ya fue probado- ha participado activamente de las negociaciones con sus encubridores. En esa ocasión, Assad le reportó a Rabbani sobre su reunión con un ministro nacional: “...muchas cosas lindas que estamos viendo...reunidos con el Ministro, me sorprendió hoy, porque una apertura muy importante hacia la colectividad...esto es política, sheik...Estamos trabajando para...el gobierno, ahora estamos trabajando porque el Ministro va a hablar con la Presidente, me dijo hoy, para que me reciba...tengo ganas de verla a la Presidenta...”. Rabbani entendía que: “...nosotros...habíamos conversado con Argentina...Irán fue el primer comprador de Argentina y ahora no compra casi nada...pero...puede cambiar esta situación con ustedes y con el gobierno”, en alusión a los actuales referentes de Irán en Argentina, como Khalil, y las autoridades del presente gobierno argentino (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). De hecho, días antes de esta reunión en la cartera de justicia, el imputado Rabbani había recibido el mensaje enviado por Cristina Fernández, a través del Ministro De Vido y de los intermediarios Luis D'Elía y Jorge Khalil, que expresaba el interés por obtener petróleo (Comunicaciones del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-111124-8, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-122551-14, CD 31; Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-132253-6, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-133130-8, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-143508-24, CD 31).   Ministerio Público de la Nación Motorizado por la ciega necesidad de las autoridades argentinas involucradas en este plan de avanzar con la maniobra encubridora, los referentes locales del régimen iraní comenzaron a tener acceso a los despachos de distintos funcionarios de la gestión de Cristina Fernández. A través del agente identificado como “Alian”, cercano a la Sra. Presidente, los representantes de Teherán en Argentina han podido acceder a favores y a un trato preferencial en las más variadas gestiones. De ese modo, han utilizado los resortes y se han valido de sus flamantes contactos con el poder político local. Por ejemplo: “Alian” le prometió a Khalil cargos en la Dirección Nacional de Aduanas y en el Ministerio de Interior y Transporte para gente de la comunidad chiita, “...tiene que haber cambios en transporte y aduana y ahí van a tratar de meter ...diez tipos en cada lado” (Comunicaciones del 4/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-07-04-112603-6.txt, CD 76 y del 7/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-07-152130-22, CD 79). También Khalil le ha pedido favores para sus contactos en la Aduana (Comunicación del 24/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-24-175330- 20.txt, CD 35). En una oportunidad, Femando Esteche le aconsejó a Khalil que para que el “blanqueo” con la comunidad iraní local tenga mayor visibilidad pública, exija algunos gestos del gobierno, como por ejemplo “...que los inviten o que los empiecen a invitar a los actos de la Casa Rosada como exponentes de la comunidad...” o “.. .que la Presidente un día vaya para el Ramadán, para un desayuno...”, y agregó: “...que la Presidenta vaya...eso es más fácil para “Alian ”...” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Pretendían darle mayor publicidad al acercamiento. En otra ocasión, ante inconvenientes impositivos con la AFIP, miembros de la comunidad recurrieron a Jorge Khalil quien, a través de Luis D’Elía, garantizó el contacto directo con el Administrador Federal de Ingresos Públicos, Ricardo Echegaray, para resolver el problema (Comunicación del 21/11/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-11-21-210631-26, CD 216). Y	se obtuvo similar resultado, esto es, contactar a Ricardo Echegaray, a través de la gestión de “Alian” quien, ante un pedido de Khalil le expresó: “...no hay problema...te venís conmigo...” (Comunicación del 13/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-06-13-213124- 24, CD 55). Cabe señalar que estos “favores” encontraron, en más de una ocasión, el correlato buscado, es decir, se tradujeron en el avenimiento de los referentes locales del régimen, como Jorge Khalil, que en más de una ocasión expresaron su apoyo al gobierno argentino y actuaron de forma tal de fortalecer los vínculos entre Teherán y Buenos Aires, contribuyendo al avance del plan encubridor. En esa línea deben entenderse expresiones como: “...tenemos que dar combate acá, le digo, con la gente del gobierno, para apoyar al gobierno...'1'’ (Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-02-14-164341-10, CD 284). Y	también en esa misma línea debe interpretarse, por ejemplo, el episodio que tuvo lugar en noviembre de 2012, antes de firmarse el acuerdo, cuando Luis D’Elía y Andrés Larroque le solicitaron a Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil que no se sume a una marcha organizada por partidos de izquierda en defensa de la “causa palestina” porque ese tipo de acciones podían repercutir en las nuevas relaciones bilaterales. Khalil accedió al pedido y explicó los motivos de su allanamiento: “...Me imagino que los troskos van a empezar con mensajes en contra del gobierno, cosa que yo no quiero...no queremos hacer algo que irrite...no queremos irritar al gobierno argentino...no voy a hacer nada para irritar al gobierno argentino ...estamos arreglando un problema mayor para nosotros... ”, en evidente alusión a las imputaciones de los iraníes por el atentado contra la AMIA (Comunicación del 16/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2012-11-16-225815-2, CD 194). Sobre el mismo tema, explicó: “...Hoy a la mañana tuve una reunión con la gente del gobierno, me pidieron que por favor no vaya a la reunión...” y le dijeron: “ ...pará la bronca porque el tema de...puede repercutir en las relaciones que están manteniendo, las conversaciones que estamos teniendo nosotros en Ginebraen clara alusión a las rondas diplomáticas que desembocarían en la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-17-183444-8, CD 195). Finalmente, sobre el mismo episodio, relató Khalil: “...estamos en plenas negociaciones con el gobierno...en base a las negociaciones que se están haciendo entre Irán y Argentina, no queremos vernos inmiscuidos nosotros. Aparte fue un pedido del gobierno. Yo estuve hablando con D'Elía y con el Cuervo Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmití al Safir...y el Safir me dijo lo mismo... 'no hagamos algo que, que pueda molestar'....” (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18-095153-16, CD 196). Ahora bien, estos pedidos y favores por parte de los referentes locales de Teherán hubieran sido impensados de no haber existido el ostensible giro político y posterior acercamiento por parte de las autoridades argentinas, como ya fue probado en la presente. De hecho, también se obtuvieron numerosas piezas probatorias que dan cuenta -justamente- de este nuevo posicionamiento político del “gobierno argentino”. Nuevamente, vale aclarar que aquí no se analizan ni valoran decisiones políticas. El valor que se le reconoce a las manifestaciones que a continuación se transcribirán radica en que revelan, una vez más, que la realidad distaba bastante de lo que se comunicaba públicamente. Mientras a los argentinos nos decían que se había logrado doblegar, de cierta manera, la histórica renuencia iraní a colaborar con la causa judicial y que Teherán se allanaba -de algún modo- a los requerimientos argentinos; lo cierto es que el mensaje recibido en Teherán era otro: la Dra. Fernández había decidido garantizar la impunidad de los iraníes acusados por el atentado terrorista, como prolegómeno al comercio por petróleo persa. Y estaba dispuesta a congraciarse con el régimen. Ese fue el mensaje recibido en Teherán, y así lo expresaron sus referentes: “...porque el gobierno ahora está a favor...” de Irán (Comunicación del 6/6/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-06-092046-14, CD 48); “...el gobierno banca...'''1 (Comunicación del 30/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-30- 225622-30,	CD41);	“ ...estamos bien. Salieron a defendernos, directamente...”, se dijo en oportunidad del debate de aprobación parlamentaria del acuerdo con Irán (Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341 -10, CD 284). El mismo día en que se firmó el acuerdo con Irán, Jorge Khalil celebraba “...este acuerdo...esta nueva relación...esta nueva etapa...”, en clara referencia a este nuevo contexto de acercamiento con el gobierno argentino (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2013-01-27-112032-4, CD 266). Unos días después, Khalil destacó nuevamente este sustancial cambio de postura: “...fijáte con quién se está arreglando el gobierno ”, en alusión al acercamiento entre Irán y Argentina (Comunicación del 3/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-03-141619-26, CD 273). En julio de ese mismo año continuaban las expresiones de júbilo por la nueva postura en relación a Irán. Khalil, el día del último aniversario del atentado contra la AMIA dijo: “ ...nosotros estamos ...ante un acuerdo con el gobierno nacional ...atrás de una negociación con el gobierno nacional...”, y de toda la conversación surge a las claras que no se está refiriendo únicamente al memorando de entendimiento, sino a un arreglo subyacente y mucho más amplio (Comunicación del 18/07/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-18-155916-12, CD 90). 18 • En el acto del Día de Al Quds , Abdul Karim Paz dijo, en torno a la causa AMIA y en referencia al Memorando de Entendimiento firmado con Irán, que: “...la Argentina ha entendido cómo son las cosas, quiere dar vuelta la página e independizarse de lo que dicen los Estados Unidos e Israel...” (Dinatale, Martín, “D'Elía y Esteche reivindicaron a la agrupación terrorista Hezbollah”, La Nación, 13/08/2013). Más recientemente, en febrero de 2014, Khalil le seguía informando a Rabbani: “...estamos trabajando bien en lo político acá...” (Comunciación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014- 02-04-093431-30, CD 291). Los referentes locales de la República Islámica habían interpretado las acciones del “gobierno argentino” como favorables a la postura e intereses de Teherán: el “gobierno argentino” ahora apoyaba sus intereses, esto es, la desincriminación de los ciudadanos iraníes en la causa judicial y consecuentemente, la desvinculación de Irán y de la comunidad iraní local de la sospecha de su participación en el atentado. Incluso los partícipes del encubrimiento dieron por sentado la desincriminación de los iraníes y el consecuente blanqueo de la comunidad, y comenzaron a planificar proyectos futuros. En ese sentido, “Alian” sostuvo: “...hay un montón de temas que tenemos que ir armándolo ...con inteligencia...estamos muy bien y hay que laburar tranquilos ....tenemos que hacer un trabajo de acá a 10 años...¿me entendés? Que en un año y medio tengamos las buenas noticias, pero acá hay que hacer un trabajo para mucho tiempo...” (Comunicación del 6/2/2013, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276). Tiempo después, los agentes iraníes continuaban operando con la misma idea: “...Es un tema de largo plazo, para trabajarlo bien...Hay que instalar un poco cuatro, cinco “verdades” fuertes, hay que instalarlas...” (Comunicación del 3/10/2014, abonado 11-6224-0263, Archivo B-1009-2014-10-03-223900- 28). Adviértase que “Alian” y Khalil tenían la seguridad que los iraníes iban a quedar liberados de la imputación de la justicia, “que en un año y medio tengamos las buenas noticias” es la expresión inequívoca que refleja ese pensamiento. Ya habían dado por removido ese obstáculo y se colocaban en otro horizonte, un escalón más arriba, pensando estratégicamente de acá a varios años. En definitiva, no fueron dos partes negociando un acuerdo, como se lo quiso presentar públicamente, son dos socios buscando borrar del modo más creíble posible, una imputación penal por un delito de lesa humanidad. VI.- Canales paralelos de comunicación y negociación El plan criminal que aquí se pone en evidencia y se denuncia de ninguna forma debe ser confundido con una negociación diplomática, aunque su ejecución haya incluido contactos diplomáticos formales. Lo cierto es que la calidad delictiva del plan también se evidencia en la necesidad de contar con esos canales paralelos, no oficiales, como vías concretas, eficientes y confiables para avanzar con el propósito que verdaderamente ha tenido el acercamiento y las negociaciones diplomáticas formales: la impunidad de los acusados iraníes por el caso AMIA. Como se mencionó previamente, existen múltiples elementos probatorios que corroboran la existencia de canales de comunicación y negociación paralelos al oficial, aunque interconectados con el mismo, que facilitaron los contactos entre Teherán y Buenos Aires a los fines del objetivo delictivo. Al referirse a un mensaje concreto, Khalil lo ilustró diciendo: “...me tiraron un dato que hay que laburarlo, que me dijeron que lo tengo que transmitir ...bueno, muchachos, tírenle ésta a los interlocutores de allá para que hablen con los interlocutores de acá... ” (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-04-130024- 6, CD 182). En otras palabras los canales paralelos contaban con “ interlocutores de acá” e “interlocutores de allá Estas pruebas dejaron al descubierto a un grupo de individuos estrechamente vinculado con funcionarios y ex funcionarios de ambos gobiernos que, desde la sombras, contribuyeron estratégica y sustancialmente con las acciones necesarias para avanzar con el objetivo criminal planeado. Entre ellos, cabe destacar la activa participación de Luis Ángel D'EIía, Fernando Luis Esteche, Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, el Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, Héctor Luis Yrimia y el individuo identificado como “Alian” perteneciente a la Secretaría de Inteligencia, orgánica o inorgánicamente, y que podría tratarse de Ramón Héctor Alian Bogado, sea este su verdadero nombre o el que utiliza en su actividad de inteligencia. Estos sujetos, implicados en la maniobra de encubrimiento, se encuentran vinculados entre sí. Véase que Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil se comunicó asiduamente con D’Elía, con Esteche, con “Alian”, con Yrimia y se reunió en varias oportunidades con Larroque. A su vez, “Alian” e Yrimia responden al mismo sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia. Estos dos últimos personajes le fueron presentados a Khalil por parte de Fernando Esteche, lo que implica que los conocía previamente. Las vinculaciones entre D’Elía y Larroque, D’Elía y Esteche y Larroque y Esteche, son públicas. Lo que parece un trabalenguas farragoso para la lectura en realidad es la demostración concreta que estos sujetos no solo se conocen sino que han tenido actividades conjuntas y, según las pruebas expuestas a lo largo de esta presentación, todos han participado en la ejecución del plan de encubrimiento. Queda expuesta así, la estrecha y promiscua vinculación entre los partícipes del plan de encubrimiento. Ahora bien, se cuenta con profusa prueba que da cuenta de la existencia de mensajes concretos relativos al objeto de esta denuncia, que han sido comunicados entre autoridades de ambos países por estos canales no oficiales. No cabe duda alguna, la actividad de estos canales de comunicación y negociación configura, sin más, una diplomacia paralela de facto. Aún antes de que se hubiera firmado el “Memorando de Entendimiento”, ya en noviembre de 2012, se negociaba por fuera de los canales diplomáticos, esto es, por vías ajenas a las reuniones que paralelamente se mantenían en Suiza. En otras palabras, mientras la diplomacia formal se reunía en la Confederación Helvética, los mensajes ocultos entre Teherán y Buenos Aires transitaban, en paralelo, otros carriles. Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil explicaba: “...vengo de La Matanza recién he tenido una reunión con Luis D'E/ia y el “Cuervo” Larroque, el de la Cámpora...que me llamaron temprano que querían hablar conmigo, que tenían un mensaje para el gobierno para dar... Y ahora me voy para Martínez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador...”, en referencia al Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, máxima autoridad oficial en territorio nacional (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-17- 104846-10.wav, CD 195). Esta misma secuencia la relató en otra comunicación telefónica: “...volví a las once de la noche de Martínez....Me fui a La Matanza, estuve hablando con el Cuervo Larroque y con D'Elía...de ahí me tuve que ir a la casa del embajador a hablar con el embajador para mandar un mensaje que me mandaron...” y agregó: “...Larroque...se sentó conmigo y me dio un mensaje que tengo que transmitir a la embajada. Fui a la embajada y transmití lo que tenía, pero no fui a la embajada, me tuve que ir hasta Martínez...”. Y explicó respecto de su relación con las autoridades argentinas: “...yo no estoy operando para ellos, yo estoy operando para los nuestros, para lo que es la embajada...ellos me mandaron a hacer una cosa, yo como soy el nexo...” (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18-100116- 6, CD 196). Al día siguiente que Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil regresó de un viaje a la República Islámica de Irán, donde se entrevistó “con las más altas esferas...con los responsables capos...con la cancillería...” (Comunicación del 11/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-05-11- 173407-12, CD 0022), se comunicó con Luis D'Elía y quedaron en reunirse, no obstante lo cual le adelantó que había desazón en Irán, aparentemente por el incumplimiento de Timerman, y que -además- no habían gustado algunas declaraciones públicas de funcionarios argentinos: “...no gustó algunas palabras que se dijeron....el comentario ese que dijo: ""¡A ver si ustedes se piensan que a mí me gusta negociar con fulanito, con los iraníes!”....eso quedó para el orto, pero igual yo te lo voy a transmitir bien cosa que vos lo transmitas por abajo...como quien no quiere la cosa...” (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-ll-083146-8.wav, CD 0022, el subrayado es propio). Los mensajes, con toda su tonalidad, llegaban directamente de Teherán a la Casa Rosada. Estos son ejemplos contundentes que prueban que ciertas autoridades argentinas utilizaron estos canales de comunicación paralelos, no oficiales y totalmente secretos para avanzar con el plan de encubrimiento. También queda perfectamente constatado el rol de cada uno de estos actores: Larroque, D'Elía y Khalil, cumplen en la maniobra criminal. Funcionan como nexos entre las máximas autoridades políticas argentinas e iraníes. Es más, Larroque es quien recibe de la Presidente, por lo general, las ordenes que luego llegan a Luis D'Elía. Tan claro como inaudito. Estos canales también fueron utilizados para hacerle llegar información actualizada a Mohsen Rabbani, uno de los imputados por el atentado contra la AMIA, de distintos aspectos configurativos del plan destinado a encubrirlo. Cabe recordar el poder decisorio que éste imputado sigue manteniendo, que le ha permitido intervenir directa y personalmente en las negociaciones entre iraníes y argentinos. Nótese que la actitud de Rabbani no es la de un prófugo preocupado por su situación procesal o por la evolución de la acusación en su contra. Al contrario, al poseer un alto grado de seguridad que se mantendrá impune gracias a la protección del régimen de su país, tiene tiempo y energías para continuar dando órdenes a la distancia y digitando el accionar de la comunidad chiita en Argentina. Por si ello fuera poco, últimamente ha tomado incluso mayor confianza al advertir la buena predisposición de las autoridades del gobierno argentino para con su persona. Ello se ve reflejado en sus diálogos. “...Yo les dije que nosotros ...habíamos conversado con Argentina...Irán fue el primer comprador de Argentina y ahora no compra casi nada...pero...puede cambiar esta situación con ustedes y con el gobierno”, en alusión a los actuales referentes de Irán en Argentina, como Khalil, y las autoridades del presente gobierno argentino (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Otro ejemplo de ello es el reporte de Jorge Khalil cuando comunicó:	“...hoy terminamos una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas...”, a lo que Rabbani respondió: “...Mándame para que evalúe...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 114842-2, CD 31). Y, luego de analizarlo, contestó: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina...y también comprar armas... ” (Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). También cabe hacer referencia que estos canales paralelos han sido utilizados para digitar acciones y comportamientos que facilitaron -de distintas maneras- el avance del plan de impunidad. Por ejemplo, para noviembre de 2012, tanto Luis D'Elía como Andrés Larroque le solicitaron a Khalil que no se sumara a una marcha organizada por partidos de izquierda en defensa de la “causa palestina” y, también, que cesara con los reproches y reclamos, porque ese tipo de acciones podían repercutir en las nuevas relaciones bilaterales. Así lo explicaba Khalil: “...no queremos hacer algo que irrite...no queremos irritar al gobierno argentino...no voy a hacer nada para irritar al gobierno argentino... ” y agregó “...estamos arreglando un problema mayor para nosotros...”, en alusión a las imputaciones por el atentado contra la AMIA, y ello ameritaba cautela. Khalil comprendió el riesgo de participar de estos actos: “...Me imagino que los troskos van a empezar con mensajes en contra del gobierno, cosa que yo no quiero...” (Comunicación del 16/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	11 -16-225815-2, CD 194). El plan de encubrimiento demandaba todas las precauciones posibles. Respecto al mismo tema Khalil agregó: “...Hoy a la mañana tuve una reunión con la gente del gobierno, me pidieron que por favor no vaya a la reunión... ” y le dijeron: “...pará la bronca porque el tema de...puede repercutir en las relaciones que están manteniendo, las conversaciones que estamos teniendo nosotros en Ginebra... ” (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	11-17-183444-8, CD 195). Y decidió: “...Entonces no quiero que ninguno de nosotros, que representa a la República Islámica de una u otra manera, como vos, como Ghaleb, como yo, como cualquiera de Flores o de la comunidad nuestra, no tiene que ir a ninguno de esos, no va a participar, en tanto y en cuanto Israel no invada....Ahora, si Israel invade...nosotros armamos un frente, no con los troskos ni con los de izquierda, con los kirchneristas, La Cámpora y todos esos van a acompañarnos. Ya lo hablé con Larroquey con D'Elía... ” (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-17-183444-8, CD 195). Y	reiteró:	“	...nosotros no estamos haciendo ninguna manifestación acá, porque estamos en plenas negociaciones con el gobierno...a esa reunión la convoqué y o...pero después la tiré para atrás ...porque en base a las negociaciones que se están haciendo entre Irán y Argentina, no queremos vernos inmiscuidos nosotros. Aparte fue un pedido del gobierno. Yo estuve hablando con D'Elía y con el Cuervo Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmití al Safir...y el Safir me dijo lo mismo... 'no hagamos algo que, que pueda molestar'....” (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18- 095153-16, CD 196). En conversación con Fernando Esteche expresó “...el sábado fui a la casa del gordo, hablé con el gordo y el gordo adelante mío lo llamó al cuervo, puso el altavoz...Cuervo, estoy con Yussefbla bla bla...le estoy diciendo que lo que me dijiste que transmita. Así, eh?...”. A esta altura, sobra aclarar que cuando se alude al “gordo” y al “cuervo”, se está haciendo referencia a Luis D'Elía y Andrés Larroque, respectivamente (Comunicación del 19/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	11-19-121034-16, CD 197). De esta serie de comunicaciones, puede concluirse que Khalil no estaba dispuesto a involucrarse, como referente de Irán, en un ataque al gobierno por parte de “los troskos” y/o cualquier agrupación política, para no poner en peligro las negociaciones que se mantenían con Teherán. D'Elía y Larroque compartían esta preocupación y trabajaron para que Khalil y sus seguidores se mantuvieran al margen de cualquier manifestación y/o crítica pública al gobierno por la posición adoptada ante hechos internacionales relacionados con el conflicto palestino-israelí. Tanto Larroque como D’Elía efectuaron sus aportes para asegurar y mantener el mejor clima posible entre las partes, mientras se ejecutaba el plan de encubrimiento ordenado por Cristina Fernández y llevado adelante por Héctor Timerman. Otro ejemplo que demuestra la voluntad de proteger el plan de encubrimiento se desprende del episodio que tuvo lugar el 29 de mayo de 2013, cuando tomó estado público el dictamen de esta Unidad Fiscal sobre la profundización de ciertos aspectos relativos al atentado contra la AMIA, entre los que se estudiaba, la infiltración de la región por parte de estructuras de inteligencia iraní. En esa ocasión, Jorge Khalil y otros miembros de la comunidad local planeaban hacer algún tipo de descargo público, pero recibieron indicaciones desde Irán de abstenerse de ello, para no hacer peligrar las relaciones con Argentina y, obviamente, la maniobra encubridora. Al respecto, sostuvo: “...le están pidiendo que no hagamos nada...el de acá ya me dijo no hagamos nada, no hagamos nada, no hagamos nada, pero no hagamos nada porque no quiere que se pudra en la relación de ellos...” (Comunicación del 04/06/2013, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-04-082254-20, CD 46). En este caso, las indicaciones de Teherán le llegaron a Khalil a través de Abdul Karim Paz, que es quien “le están pidiendo que no hagamos nadan y con “el de acá”, alude al Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina. En suma, el encubrimiento era lo más importante y no debía verse afectado por cuestiones coyunturales. Por último, estos canales paralelos contribuyeron al desarrollo de acciones destinadas a la creación de una versión alternativa y falsa sobre el atentado, verosímil a la opinión pública, que permita redireccionar la pesquisa hacia “nuevos imputados”, encubriendo en forma definitiva a los acusados iraníes, a quienes las pruebas y las distintas resoluciones judiciales los involucran muy claramente en el atentado. Ilustran este punto las numerosas comunicaciones entre el referente iraní Jorge Khalil y otros partícipes, fundamentalmente, Fernando Esteche, Héctor Yrimia y el agente de inteligencia “Alian”. Para mayor abundamiento, corresponde remitirse a lo desarrollado en el punto IV.c.3.b de la presente. En suma, en los puntos anteriores se han ejemplificado episodios que muestran el modo en que circularon mensajes, pedidos, inquietudes, información, etc., de un lado al otro del conjunto de individuos involucrados en el plan de encubrimiento aquí expuesto. Lo descripto en este punto permite visualizar el modo mediante el cual los autores del plan lograron establecer un vínculo indirecto, a través del conjunto de intermediarios, no sólo con los referentes iraníes en Teherán sino con uno de los imputados por el atentado contra la AMIA, Mohsen Rabbani, cuya detención con fines de extradición ha sido exhortada por la justicia argentina y es requerido con la máxima prioridad de búsqueda por Interpol. A continuación corresponde analizar el rol y los aportes de cada uno de los individuos antes mencionados, que tuvieron participación en el plan criminal aquí denunciado. a)	Cristina Elisabet Fernández Para comprender el rol de la Dra. Cristina Fernández en este plan de impunidad debe quedar claro que el delito denunciado no se hubiera cometido sin su decisión y sus consecuentes acciones. En efecto, la Sra. Presidente de la Nación Argentina ha emitido una expresa directiva para que se diseñara y ejecutara un plan de encubrimiento tendiente a desvincular a los acusados de nacionalidad iraní en la causa por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, a efectos de garantizarles su impunidad definitiva. Dicha decisión estuvo motivada en la búsqueda de un acercamiento de carácter geopolítico como así también en el restablecimiento de plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal con la República Islámica de Irán, por entender que así podría atenuarse sustancialmente la crisis energética nacional, mediante intercambios mercantiles de “petróleo por granos”. La circunstancia que haya sido la más alta autoridad de la República quién ordenó la ejecución de estas acciones delictivas implica que lo aquí se denuncia es de una gravedad institucional enorme. Analizada la evidencia con el máximo grado de rigor, surge de modo inequívoco la participación de la primera mandataria en el plan criminal aquí denunciado. En varias oportunidades, los partícipes del plan criminal han hecho referencia a ello, asegurando que todo está: “cerrado muy arriba”, todo había sido decidido “al más alto niver porque “lo pidió la jefa” y su canciller, obediente, implemento el plan porque fue “orden, orden y orden” (Comunicación del 6/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276, Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-111124-8, CD 31; Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 01 -28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). No puede soslayarse la consternación que provoca constatar que la Sra. Presidente se encuentre involucrada en una vil maquinación, destinada nada menos que a dejar de lado la búsqueda de justicia en la causa que investiga el mayor atentado terrorista sufrido en la historia argentina.   Ministerio Público de la Nación Lamentablemente, como es de público conocimiento, no es la primera vez que el conductor de los destinos de la Nación cae inmerso en acciones criminales para desviar la investigación del caso AMIA. Tal fue el grado de compromiso que asumió la Dra. Fernández en este plan criminal de impunidad que se ocupó de seleccionar muy cuidadosamente a algunos de sus colaboradores o, para ser más exactos, sus cómplices, valiéndose de distintas personas para ejecutar el plan. Ese ha sido uno de sus aportes fundamentales para la instrumentación del plan. Cuando se observan y se analizan las credenciales de cada uno de los partícipes, puede advertirse que la elección fue acertada pues todos poseen los antecedentes y las condiciones necesarias para cumplir fielmente los encargos de la Presidente. En primer lugar, se valió de un sujeto identificado como “Alian”, hombre de su entorno, consustanciado con el régimen iraní, contacto directo del máximo referente de dicho país en Argentina y miembro de la Secretaría de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación; para que asista al señor canciller en todas aquellas acciones, relacionadas con la implementación del plan de encubrimiento, que por ser notoriamente delictivas, de ninguna manera convendría que fueran realizadas por un encumbrado ministro nacional. La circunstancia de que “Alian” cumpla funciones -orgánicas o inorgánicas- para el organismo de inteligencia nacional no es un dato menor. Todo lo contrario, dicha pertenencia le permite aprovechar los recursos de tal secretaría de estado, lo que lo hace especialmente apto para cumplir con su tarea. También encargó al dirigente Luis D’Elía que se ocupe de transmitir y recibir todos los mensajes que circularon a través de los canales paralelos de comunicación y negociación desarrollados para llevar a buen puerto el encubrimiento. La decisión de la Presidente, en este caso, también fue apropiada pues D’Elía ha sido, por muchos años, no solo acérrimo defensor del régimen iraní sino, según sus propios dichos, un “soldado” incondicional de Cristina Fernández. Asimismo, escogió al Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, otro encendido seguidor de la Presidente, que ofició de nexo, de puente entre ella y los partícipes clandestinos del plan de impunidad. La necesidad de contar con un intermediario es obvia. Tratándose de la ejecución de un delito, la primera mandataria ha preferido, astutamente, mantenerse incomunicada de aquellas personas que ejecutan las acciones criminales. Dado que los cómplices debían actuar siguiendo sus órdenes, resultó imperioso contar con una persona de extrema confianza que pudiera justificar su vinculación personal tanto con la Dra. Cristina Fernández como con Luis D’Elía y dicho sujeto resultó ser el nombrado Larroque. Y	principalmente, delegó gran parte de la instrumentación del plan criminal en su Canciller, Héctor Timerman, a quien inicialmente ordenó que contacte a los representantes iraníes a los fines de hacerles saber la predisposición del gobierno argentino a dejar de lado cualquier reclamo de justicia en relación al caso AMIA, a cambio de un acercamiento comercial entre ambos países, lo que comenzó en 2011 en la ciudad de Alepo. En concreto, por orden presidencial, Timerman se apartó de la comitiva oficial que visitaba distintos países de Medio Oriente, para dirigirse a la ciudad siria de Alepo, lugar donde mantuvo, en secreto, una reunión con el canciller iraní, Ali Salehi. Allí transmitió el siguiente mensaje: “...la Argentina ya no está más interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados, pero en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones económicas con Irán... ” (Ys. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Polémica en torno a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). Sus instrucciones incluyeron la autorización para que el Ministro Timerman negociara e instrumentara, en forma secreta, el plan de impunidad que removería el escollo que significa la acusación judicial argentina contra los ciudadanos iraníes. Dicho plan, incluyó la decisión presidencial de instrumentar en el Memorando de Entendimiento un Al BERTO NISMAN FISCAL GENERAL mecanismo que permita disponer el cese de las notificaciones rojas, por ser ese el único real interés del régimen iraní. Y ello quedó plasmado en el punto séptimo del pacto. El plan de impunidad pergeñado por la Dra. Fernández fue mucho más allá del cese de estas prioridades de búsqueda de Interpol e incluyó la desvinculación definitiva de los imputados iraníes. Por eso, su instrumentación conllevó la creación de una “Comisión de la Verdad”, como se dispuso en el pacto, cuyas conclusiones estaban arregladas de antemano y garantizarían la acordada impunidad. En conocimiento de esta circunstancia, se dijo: “...alguien va a salir...con la cara manchada de acá...”, a lo que Jorge Khalil, referente de Irán, reconoció: “...Obvio, eso ya está arreglado...”, pero aclaró que no iban a ser de los iraníes los perjudicados y remató: “... ¡¿cómo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo?! Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa..y (Comunicación del 27/1/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266). Asimismo, como se demostró, autorizó a su canciller a sellar acuerdos secretos con los representantes iraníes que, según las pruebas incorporadas a la causa, garantizaban el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol y el otorgamiento de un salvoconducto al ex Ministro de Defensa de Irán, Ahmad Vahidi, asegurándole que nunca sería interrogado. La existencia de pactos secretos fue puesta de manifiesto por el entonces Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores Iraní, Ali Akbar Salehi cuando dijo: “...El [contenido] del acuerdo entre Irán y Argentina en relación con la cuestión de la AMIA será hecho público en el momento adecuado y la cuestión [de los imputados iraníes] está incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo...'’’’ (“Tehran insists accord with Argentina includes Interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects”, Mercopress, 19/03/2013) y por los partícipes del encubrimiento que expresaron: “...estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares también... ” (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-11-083146- 8.wav, CD 0022); y “...es pescado podrido, después hablamos personalmente ....está dentro del marco eso....se sabía....es más profundo todavía... ” (Comunicación del 12/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-12-100525-14, CD 282). Otra directiva expresa de la Sra. Presidente, esta vez canalizada a través del agente “Alian”, fue la orden de construir una hipótesis falsa, sostenida en pruebas inventadas, para incriminar a “nuevos autores del atentado”, que serían acusados con el fin de desvincular definitivamente del hecho a los imputados iraníes. Justamente, “Alian” dio cuenta de esta orden, al reconocer que el suscripto “...va a hacer culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas...lo que viene ahora... es una prueba contundente...” (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Esta cuestión ya había sido mencionada por Fernando Esteche, otro partícipe del plan, quien aun antes de suscribirse el memorando, dijo: “...quieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA...”, tarea a cargo de los servicios de inteligencia. Según señaló Esteche, como “no van a poder decir que fueron los israelíes”, porque -claramente- no sería creíble, tenían que armar una hipótesis falsa, y hasta hablaron de involucrar a “una conexión de fachos locales” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Otro aporte destacable al plan ha sido el anuncio que efectuó ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, el 25 de septiembre de 2012,	ocasión en la informó que, en respuesta a un pedido efectuado una semana atrás por la República Islámica de Irán, había instruido a su canciller, Héctor Timerman, que inicie un proceso de negociación con dicho país. Esta contribución al plan resultó fundamental, porque en el relato oficial respaldado por la Sra. Presidente se pretendió -y así se hizo- ocultar que ya venían manteniéndose un año y medio de negociaciones secretas y que el acercamiento se había materializado por iniciativa de Argentina, y no de Irán, como se afirmó. No podía reconocer públicamente que le había ordenado a su Canciller que ofreciera a las autoridades iraníes impunidad para sus nacionales, a cambio de un acercamiento geopolítico y comercial. Como ya se dijo, este plan criminal exigió contar con el mayor apoyo posible de la opinión pública y -fundamentalmente- de las víctimas, respecto del acuerdo que se firmaría y se firmó con Irán, como una forma de facilitar su ejecución. Para ello, se ocultaron las negociaciones previas y la iniciativa Argentina, y con el mismo fin, en septiembre de 2012, la Sra. Presidente prometió, a sabiendas de que no cumpliría, que consultaría a familiares y víctimas, previo adoptar cualquier temperamento sobre las tratativas con Teherán. Solamente buscaba inspirar una falsa confianza en las víctimas del atentado, prometiéndoles que serían consultados, para luego sorprenderlos con el acuerdo ya consumado, el domingo 27 de enero de 2013 (Discurso de Cristina Fernández ante la 67a Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, de fecha 25 de septiembre de 2012; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información para la prensa N° 011/13). En la misma línea, y abusando de su cargo y funciones, continuó encabezando el despliegue de una versión oficial y falsa de los hechos, para ocultar la criminalidad del verdadero plan. Así, presentó al Memorando de Entendimiento como un “logro histórico” (Mensajes de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fernández del 27 de enero de 2013 de horas: 10:26 a 10:32). El mismo día de la aprobación emitió en su cuenta oficial de Twitter, una seguidilla de mensajes que pretendieron instalar la noticia como una “victoria”, ello a fin de mantener oculto el verdadero sentido del Memorando de Entendimiento: brindar un marco jurídico creíble para instrumentar solapadamente la impunidad de los acusados iraníes y así, viabilizar políticamente el acercamiento geopolítico y comercial con Teherán. Continuó en esa tesitura cuando, en su mensaje de elevación del anteproyecto de ley de aprobación del Memorando al Congreso Nacional, sostuvo: “...Se quiere presentar el acuerdo como una especie de argucia para ‘iniciar ’ el comercio con Irán. Lo cierto es que ese comercio existe desde 1990 y, salvo los años 2004 y 2005, ha sido superávit ario...” (Mensaje Presidencial N° 173 de elevación al Congreso Nacional del anteproyecto de ley sobre el Memorando de Entendimiento entre Argentina e Irán). Maliciosamente, la Sra. Presidente se estaba refiriendo al comercio entre privados. No podía admitir que había decidido aniquilar la justicia en el caso AMIA a cambio de establecer un comercio a nivel estatal que no existía y que buscaba retomar. A pesar de negar públicamente que el comercio fuera un interés en la vinculación con Irán, en forma secreta, la Sra. Presidente buscó poner en práctica su decisión de comerciar con Teherán, encomendando gestiones a su Ministro de Planificación Federal, Arquitecto Julio De Vido. Para ello, le ordenó que avance en las tratativas para intercambiar petróleo por granos a través de los canales paralelos de comunicación con el régimen. Así lo reconoció Luis D'Elía: “...la reunión fue porque la pidió la jefa...”, en referencia a su encuentro con De Vido y afirmó: “...acá estuve hablando con el ‘quía’ [en alusión al Ministro De Vido]....e//os están dispuestos a mandar la gente de YPF con nosotros dos, a hacer negocios allá....está muy interesado en intercambiar lo de aquellos por granos y carne allá...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-111124-8, CD31). El compromiso con los damnificados por el atentado era nulo, al punto que ya para el mes de mayo de 2013, el Poder Ejecutivo Nacional, por orden de la Dra. Fernández, se hallaba embarcado en negociaciones secretas con Irán para intercambiar petróleo por carne y granos. Y, como ya se probó, de estas mismas tratativas comerciales participó Mohsen Rabbani, uno de los acusados en la causa AMIA. Ejemplo de ello es la ocasión en que Khalil le informó a Rabbani: “...hoy terminamos una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas... ”, a lo que Rabbani contestó: “mándeme para que evalúe” y luego de evaluarlo respondió: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina...y también comprar armas.. ’’(Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31 y del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Es decir, mientras públicamente la Sra. Presidente aseguraba que sus acciones estaban exclusivamente motivadas en la búsqueda de justicia para la causa AMIA y que el Memorando de Entendimiento era la única solución viable para el caso, uno de esos acusados, Mohsen Rabbani, secreta y clandestinamente negociaba con nuestras autoridades a través de intermediarios y canales ocultos un intercambio de petróleo por granos, la venta de armas y, lo que es más grave, su propia impunidad. La siguiente contribución para la consecución del plan de impunidad fue instalar, desde lo más alto del poder, la versión de que la causa por la investigación del atentado contra la sede de la AMIA estaba paralizada, con la intención de confundir a la opinión pública y así poder presentar ante la sociedad argentina que el Memorando de Entendimiento - recuérdese, el instrumento diseñado para viabilizar la impunidad de los acusados iraníes- era la única salida posible. Dicha intervención se desdobló en varios episodios y se mantuvo a lo largo del tiempo. En efecto, en su mensaje por cadena nacional del 8 de febrero de 2013, en ocasión de comunicar el envío del anteproyecto de ley de ratificación del Memorando al Congreso Nacional expresó: “...Este memorándum que hemos acordado es un paso adelante para destrabar una causa que hace 19 años que está paral izada... ” (Discurso de Cristina Fernández del 8/2/13). En marzo de 2013, escribió en las redes sociales “...teníamos que destrabar esto...”, obviamente en alusión a la causa AMIA (Twitter del 4/3/2013 17:05) y ante la Asamblea Legislativa: “...mi compromiso es intentar destrabar esto...'1'' (Mensaje de la Presidente a la Asamblea Legislativa con motivo de la apertura del 131° período de sesiones ordinarias del Congreso de la Nación, 1/3/2013). Volvió a la carga con la misma mentira en su discurso ante 68° Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, la Sra. Presidente afirmó: “...la causa está estancada, desde hace 19 años que no se moviliza...'’'’ (Discurso ante Naciones Unidas del 24 de septiembre de 2013). Lo paradójico del caso es que la Sra. Presidente conoce, sin lugar a dudas, que la causa ha avanzado, máxime teniendo en cuenta la amplia publicidad que tuvieron los sucesivos dictámenes de esta Unidad Fiscal y diferentes pronunciamientos judiciales, por lo que sus expresiones en sentido contrario solo puede ser tomadas como una manifestación concreta del dolo con que ha actuado buscando desprestigiar a la justicia argentina como un modo indirecto de legitimar un acuerdo bilateral -léase Memorando de Entendimiento- que es la base de un plan criminal por ella misma ideado. Otra de sus contribuciones tuvo lugar el viernes 27 de septiembre de 2013, un día antes del encuentro entre los Ministros de Relaciones Exteriores argentino e iraní, cuando le ordenó al cómplice Luis D’Elía que transmitiera un mensaje al agente persa Jorge Khalil. Así lo reconoció D'Elía: “...tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar para allá urgente, antes de mañana....estoy en la casa de gobierno ahora...no hay asunto más importante que éste, creémelo...’’’’ (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-103753-14, CD 161). Además, Luis D’Elía le solicitó a Khalil “necesito que hables con el sheik allá [en alusión a Mohsen Rabbani]...w/ra que es muy groso lo que tengo, eh...me lo pidió...'’’’ (Comunicaciones del 27/9/13, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-114113-28, CD 161; Archivo B- 1009-2013-09-27-104245-8.txt, CD 161). El nombrado Khalil especificó el pedido de Cristina Fernández, ..Necesita que el gobierno iraní junto con el gobierno argentino mañana anuncie la conformación de la ‘Comisión de la Verdad' ...que por favor lo anuncien en conjunto mañana en la reunión...que se defina el día de la reunión de la ‘Comisión de la Verdad ’ y también que se defina el día, en el mes de enero, en que el juez argentino pueda viajar a Teherán...” (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-115448-6, CD 161). Luego se aclaró: “...la reunión se hace de apuro a pedido de Cristina...fíjate que Rohani [el Presidente de Irán] ni habló del tema AMIA en su discurso...” (Comunicación del 27/09/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4966, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161). De los aportes concretos y específicos de la Sra. Presidente que se han podido acreditar con sólido sustento probatorio, surge con claridad que no solamente fue quien decidió la articulación de este plan criminal de impunidad y, para ello, se valió de distintos actores para llevar adelante su ejecución, sino que en todo momento estuvo en control de la misma, ya sea impartiendo órdenes directas a sus cómplices, o bien encabezando la necesaria campaña discursiva para camuflar la perpetración del delito. Se está en presencia de la persona que ejerce el máximo cargo público de la República Argentina. De allí que su responsabilidad sea enorme. Lamentablemente, ha decidido cometer un delito para brindar impunidad a los prófugos iraníes de la causa AMIA; ha elegido a algunos partícipes de la maniobra delictiva, involucrando directamente a -cuanto menos- uno de sus ministros y a un legislador nacional; ha controlado la evolución del plan; ha negociado por interpósitas personas con uno de los prófugos; y se ha involucrado personalmente en algunas acciones de ocultamiento que este sofisticado plan requería. Los episodios relatados en este capítulo así lo demuestran. b)	Héctor Marcos Timerman El Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, Héctor Timerman, ha sido -sin duda alguna- el principal instrumentador del plan de impunidad ideado y ordenado por la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fernández. Naturalmente, tratándose de un plan criminal que ha involucrado a un país extranjero, el Canciller ocupaba el puesto clave para encargarse personalmente de muchos aspectos de este encubrimiento. Desde su función, transmitió a Irán la decisión del gobierno argentino de abandonar el reclamo de justicia en la causa AMIA; acordó la baja de las notificaciones rojas; signó acuerdos secretos con la parte iraní; participó de las negociaciones, de la redacción y de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, pieza central del plan de impunidad. Y se involucró personalmente en la campaña de descrédito y engaño, destinada a destruir la credibilidad de la causa judicial con el fin de, dolosamente, presentar al acuerdo con Irán como la única vía apta para solucionar el caso. El repaso concreto de cada una de sus intervenciones y aportes al plan delictivo aquí denunciado demuestra con absoluta claridad y solidez probatoria que Héctor Timerman resultó ser un actor esencial en la maniobra para lograr la impunidad prevista para los acusados iraníes. La prueba en su contra es abrumadora. En efecto, el comienzo de su actuación criminal coincidió con el inicio de la ejecución del delito. Por orden presidencial, se apartó de la comitiva oficial que visitaba distintos países de Medio Oriente, para dirigirse a la ciudad siria de Alepo, lugar donde mantuvo, en secreto, una reunión con el canciller iraní, Ali Salehi. Allí transmitió el siguiente mensaje: “...la Argentina ya no está más interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados, pero en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones económicas con Irán... ” ffs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Argentina negocia con Irán dejar de lado la investigación de los atentados”, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, “Polémica en tomo a la negociación secreta entre Argentina e Irán”, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011). En este plan, Héctor Timerman comandó las tratativas con los representantes iraníes, aquellas que se mantuvieron en secreto y también las que tomaron estado público. Es decir, Timerman desempeñó un rol central en la negociación con la contraparte iraní, para convenir la impunidad definitiva de los prófugos, así como el cese de las notificaciones rojas. Una contribución central al plan de impunidad del Ministro Timerman ha sido, sin lugar a dudas, la suscripción del Memorando de 18	El día mundial de Al Quds, simboliza la unidad de las naciones, en particular, de los musulmanes, con el fin de apoyar a los palestinos contra los Estados Unidos y el régimen israelí. w Ministerio Público de la Nación	alberto nis^wn I Entendimiento en representación de la República Argentina, pues se trató de una acción definitiva en la ejecución del plan criminal. Con la firma de este acuerdo Timerman aportó el instrumento legal necesario para el plan criminal, dado que permite encubrir a los acusados de distintas maneras: a) propiciando el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol (punto 7); b) garantizando impunidad mediante la instauración acordada de un procedimiento intrincado, infinito, que no conduce a nada y que solo diluye acusaciones y viabiliza desincriminación, alternativa notablemente favorecida por la ausencia total de plazos que marquen la implementación del acuerdo; y c) articulando, a través de la “Comisión de la Verdad” creada en el pacto, la desvinculación total de los imputados respecto del atentado contra la AMIA, permitiendo redireccionar la pesquisa hacia otros autores e hipótesis. En efecto, como se ha sostenido y probado, el Memorando de Entendimiento no pretendió que los acusados iraníes declararan ante el juez y el fiscal de la causa AMIA. Todo lo contrario, se trató de uno de los medios elegidos por los socios del plan criminal para eliminar las imputaciones de la justicia argentina y para, en definitiva, garantizar su definitiva impunidad en la causa. Además de la suscripción del Memorando de Entendimiento, otro aporte al plan criminal, por parte del Ministro Timerman, ha sido la concreción de otros acuerdos de carácter secreto, que incluyen -justamente- el cese de las notificaciones rojas, y también conceden beneficios mayores como, por ejemplo, que el ex Ministro de Defensa, Ahmad Vahidi, aun con el acuerdo vigente, jamás se presentaría ante el juez de la causa. Existen comunicaciones telefónicas obtenidas de intervenciones judicialmente dispuestas que dan cuenta de estos acuerdos secretos al hablar, por ejemplo, de que “estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares también” (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-ll-083146-8.wav, CD 0022). O cuando, en relación a la noticia que informaba que Vahidi no sería interrogado a pesar de lo previsto en el Memorando, el referente local de Irán, que evidentemente contaba con información de primera mano, manifestó: “...es pescado podrido, después hablamos personalmente ....está dentro del marco es o.... se sabía.... es más profundo todavía... ” (Comunicación del 12/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-12-100525-14, CD 282). Y como si todos estos indicios no fueran suficientes, el propio Canciller Salehi hizo referencia a la existencia de otros acuerdos secretos con Timerman (“Tehran insists accord with Argentina includes Interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects”, Mercopress, 19/03/2013). Luce evidente que el compromiso de Timerman, por orden de la Sra. Presidente, fue gestionar el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, dado que se trataba del interés primordial de Irán para firmar el acuerdo. El apego a la legalidad del Organismo Internacional de Policía Criminal frustró este primer objetivo delictivo de los autores de este plan de impunidad. Cuando, por fortuna, Interpol intercedió a tiempo para evitar el cese de las prioridades de búsqueda, informando: “...La Oficina de Asuntos Jurídicos de la Secretaría General de Interpol manifiesta que dicho acuerdo [en referencia al Memorando de Entendimiento entre Argentina e Irán] no implica ningún tipo de cambio en el estatus de las notificaciones rojas publicadas en relación a los crímenes investigados en la causa AMIA...” (Nota N° LA/35678/47/3.1/EGI/tsa, Consejería Jurídica, Secretaría General, Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal, 15/03/13), el Canciller Timerman realizó nuevas acciones destinadas a favorecer el plan criminal y en el mes de mayo de 2013 se reunió con el Secretario General de Interpol, Ronald Noble, en Lyon, Francia, para lograr que Interpol tome en cuenta el acuerdo bilateral y, de tal manera, acceda a conceder la baja de las citadas prioridades de búsqueda, aunque públicamente comunicó lo contrario (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N° 122/13 del 30/5/2013; Interpol, “La visita del canciller argentino a Interpol se centró en la colaboración policial internacional”, 30/05/2013). En ese contexto, los representantes iraníes hicieron notar su disconformidad por el fracaso en la baja de las notificaciones rojas: “...hay un poquito de desazón de allá... Desazón...Me parece que el ruso este de mierda [en alusión a Héctor Timerman] se mandó alguna ...estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares [en referencia a las notificaciones rojas] también...”; “...Timerman no cumplió con algunas cosas. Esto es así de claro. No cumplió con algunas cosas... ” (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-ll-083146-8.wav, CD 0022 y Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-111124-8, CD 31). El Ministro realizó nuevos aportes al plan y en noviembre de 2012,	volvió a reunirse con Noble a quien informó de la continuación de las tratativas entre ambos países, en tomo al memorándum (Interpol, Comunicado de Prensa: “La seguridad mundial, eje de la visita a Interpol del Ministro argentino de Asuntos Exteriores”, Lyon, Francia, 26/11/2013). La intención fue clara: informar a Noble que el Memorando de Entendimiento entre ambos países avanzaba fue una forma sutil e indirecta de solicitar que Interpol reviera su postura y accediera a dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de los iraníes. Sin obtener el resultado anhelado y prometido, el ministro argentino cambió de estrategia e intentó convencer a los iraníes de que las notificaciones rojas cesarían luego de las audiencias. Al respecto se informó: “...En diálogo con su par iraní, Javad Zarif el canciller Timerman consideró que las circulares rojas caerían automáticamente en cuanto el juez que investiga el atentado, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, les tome declaración en Irán a los cinco acusados...'” (Di Natale, Martín, “La negociación con Irán, empantanada por la lista de Interpol”, La Nación 8/12/13). Ahora bien, como quedó claro en esta denuncia, el plan de impunidad no solo necesitó de un camuflaje jurídico, sino también de una estrategia discursiva y mediática para impedir que surja a la luz su oculta   finalidad criminal. En este necesario ocultamiento Héctor Timerman también desempeñó un rol fundamental. En efecto, cuando las negociaciones ya habían tomado estado público, debieron extremarse los cuidados para que nada detenga la ejecución del plan criminal. En ese tren de precauciones que favorecieron la comisión del encubrimiento aquí denunciado, Héctor Timerman abusó del secreto propio que pueden gozar las tratativas diplomáticas para ocultar los avances del plan delictual y, emitió comunicados desde la Cancillería Argentina, para engañar a la opinión pública sobre el contenido de las negociaciones, a fin de garantizar que nada detenga el curso criminal que estaba por culminar. Al inicio de dicho proceso, ambos ministerios emitieron un comunicado conjunto donde dijeron haberse comprometido a explorar mecanismos legales que no estuvieran en contradicción con los sistemas legales de Argentina e Irán (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Información para la Prensa 313/12, del 27/9/12). El resultado de estas tratativas fue, justamente, el Memorando de Entendimiento, que luego sería declarado inconstitucional por la Sala I de la Excma. Cámara en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal (CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 “AMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N°6- Secretaría N°ll), lo que evidenció la contradicción con lo anunciado por el Canciller Timerman, en tanto el instrumento jurídico ha vulnerado flagrantemente el sistema legal argentino. En otro comunicado, antes de suscribir el acuerdo, la cartera a cargo de Timerman afirmó: “...El Gobierno Nacional ratifica que el único compromiso es con las víctimas y el derecho de sus familiares a hallar en la verdad y en la justicia la reparación debida. Argentina reafirma que en dicho objetivo no hav lugar para intereses seopolíticos. ni propios, ni ajenos...” (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N°360/12, del 31/10/2012, el subrayado es propio). Justamente, como aquí ya se ha probado holgadamente, uno de los intereses centrales de la maniobra criminal ha sido la voluntad de acercamiento geopolítico con Teherán, conforme lo decidiera la Sra. Presidente. Está claro, entonces, que el canciller Timerman obró de mala fe para concretar el plan de impunidad y no tuvo inhibición alguna para realizar acciones ulteriores tendientes a favorecerlo. El dolo que lo caracterizó en toda esta maniobra criminal se puso de manifiesto, por ejemplo, tan sólo dos días después de firmado el Memorando, es decir, el 29 de enero de 2013, cuando el ministro intentó un acercamiento reuniéndose con las entidades comunitarias judías que habían expresado su rechazo al pacto. En esa oportunidad, tal como lo declaró el entonces Presidente de la AMIA, Sr. Guillermo Borger: “...el canciller está dispuesto a generar una nota aclaratoria, una nota anexa con todos estos interrogantes y que él mismo suscribirá...” (Declaraciones de Borger a la Agencia Judía de Noticias, “Borger después de la visita de Timerman a la AMIA”, 29/1/13). En un comunicado oficial, AMIA plasmó el compromiso asumido por el Canciller Timerman de confeccionar un anexo al Memorando que asegurara que las audiencias en Teherán fueran declaraciones indagatorias conforme lo prevé el derecho argentino, que fueran recibidas por autoridades argentinas y que el proceso previsto en el acuerdo no hiciera caer las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. AI respecto, Memoria Activa emitió otro comunicado dando cuenta del mismo compromiso (“AMIA informa a la opinión pública sobre las conclusiones de la reunión mantenida con el canciller Timerman en el día de ayer”, Prensa Judía, 30/01/2013; “La AMIA pide que las promesas de Timerman sean anexadas por escrito al acuerdo original”, Clarín, 30 de enero de 2013; Comunicado de Memoria Activa a la opinión pública, del 31 de enero de 2013). Pese a todo ello, luego de estos comunicados, el Canciller negó haberse comprometido con víctimas, familiares y dirigentes comunitarios a tramitar un anexo al acuerdo (“La AMIA pide al gobierno que rehaga el memorándum con Irán”, La Nación, 1/2/2013; Capiello, Hernán, “Timerman se molestó con la AMIA por sus exigencias”, La Nación, 1/2/2013). En otras palabras, a pesar de lo expuesto y burdo de esta promesa incumplida y negada, Héctor Timerman estaba operando para facilitar y ocultar la maniobra delictiva, aún a costo de su reputación pública. En la tarea de desprestigiar a la investigación judicial, Héctor Timerman volvió a cumplir un papel determinante en esta fase específica del plan delictivo realizando aportes constantes, como en ocasión del tratamiento parlamentario del acuerdo, cuando señaló: “...Por primera vez hay un compromiso por escrito de Irán...para que la causa AMIA pueda salir de la total parálisis en la que se encuentra”, para luego agregar “...proceso judicial en curso, que no ha tenido avances de ningún tipo en los últimos años” (Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Asuntos Constitucionales y de Justicia y Asuntos. Penales de la Cámara de Senadores desarrollado el 13 de febrero de 2013 y Versión taquigráfica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Justicia y Asuntos Constitucionales de la Cámara de Diputados, Congreso Nacional, desarrollado el 26 de febrero de 2013). En otra oportunidad, declaró: “...Me ofende que Ud. invente lo de los intereses económicos... ¿Cómo voy a hacer algo que está prohibido por las Naciones Unidas?...porque hay sanciones económicas impuestas por las Naciones Unidas, de las cuales Argentina es suscripta, que impiden el comercio con Irán más allá del que se está realizando, que es en granos, y eso no lo hace el gobierno argentino....lo hacen las empresas privadas...” (Tenembaum, Ernesto, Tierra de Locos, entrevista a Héctor Timerman, 18/2/13). Más allá de que lo afirmado no es cierto y contradice otras declaraciones públicas del propio Timerman, estas manifestaciones se dan de bruces con la prueba directa que aquí se presenta, donde se constató que el Poder Ejecutivo integrado por el canciller Timerman negociaba secretamente con Irán la compra petróleo y la venta de carne y granos, y además, cabe señalar que de esas tratativas participó uno de los prófugos de la causa AMIA: Mohsen Rabbani. Ejemplo de ello corresponde mencionar la comunicación interceptada en mayo de 2013, de la que intervino Rabbani, a quién se le informó: “...hoyparticipamos de una reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPFpara arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas ...bueno es cuestión de verlo”, a lo que Rabbani respondió: mándeme para que evalúe”. Luego de evaluarlo, Rabbani contestó: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que están listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina, vender tractores...y también comprar armas...'” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31 y del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39). Mientras la justicia argentina bregaba por lograr la detención de los acusados por el atentado para poder someterlos a un juicio justo y mientras los familiares y sobrevivientes aguardaban con ilusión la llegada de ese momento, el canciller Timerman y la Presidente Fernández mantuvieron negociaciones secretas con uno de los prófugos buscados y, en simultáneo, se ufanaban públicamente de estar colaborando para el avance de la causa. Otra contribución a la maniobra delictiva denunciada se advirtió en el rol que desempeñó Timerman en relación a la puesta en escena en la que se pretendió engañar a la opinión pública sobre aspectos relativos al acuerdo. Fue Timerman quien comunicó que la reunión con su par iraní nacía de un pedido de Teherán, en respuesta al discurso presidencial ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, cuando -en realidad- se comprobó que “...la reunión se hace de apuro a pedido de Cristina...” (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161). Y fue Timerman quien, sin la compañía de su par, comunicó la aprobación interna del acuerdo por las autoridades iraníes, es decir, un acto de gobierno del régimen iraní. Resumiendo, quien debería velar por los intereses de todos los argentinos en materia de relaciones exteriores, se encuentra involucrado en la ejecución de un ominoso plan de encubrimiento ideado, planificado e instrumentado para dotar de impunidad a los acusados iraníes por el caso AMIA y desvincularlos de forma definitiva de la investigación por el atentado. En esta tarea, ha faltado a sus deberes de funcionario público, conforme lo requiere el alto cargo ministerial que ostenta y lo exige la Ley de Ministerios de la Nación; ha infringido la ley penal, incurriendo en múltiples conductas delictivas; ha avasallado la actuación de la justicia argentina de los últimos ocho años, efectuando concesiones que echan por tierra los logros obtenidos en el marco de una causa sumamente compleja; ha engañado y mentido a dirigentes comunitarios, a las agrupaciones de familiares de víctimas del atentado, a los sobrevivientes, a legisladores nacionales, a la prensa y a la sociedad argentina toda, no dudando en tergiversar la realidad, con el objeto de ocultar el plan criminal del que participó. Estas conductas merecen el máximo reproche y la aplicación rigurosa de las leyes que han sido violadas. a)	Luis Angel D'Elía Luis D'Elía ha sido el interlocutor válido del que se han servido la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller para mantener activas las negociaciones secretas y clandestinas con Irán en relación al plan de encubrimiento. Esto no puede sorprender a nadie pues ha sido a lo largo de muchos años, y continúa siendo aún hoy, un encendido defensor del régimen iraní, que ha reproducido en los medios vernáculos, la versión históricamente sostenida por las autoridades iraníes, cuestionando la acusación judicial que pesa sobre sus nacionales por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, a quienes ha defendido públicamente en reiteradas oportunidades. Tiene probadas y estrechas relaciones con autoridades de la República Islámica de Irán, con quienes se contacta y ha compartido entrevistas radiales, viajes, conferencias, actos políticos, etc. Ello sentó las bases para que haya sido invitado a Irán en más de una ocasión, además de haber realizado otros viajes gracias al auspicio y apoyo de sus amistades persas, como, por ejemplo, su visita a la República del Líbano en 2012. (Obarrio, Mariano, “D'Elía prometió acercarse más a Irán”, La Nación, 28/02/2007; “D'Elía, más lejos: Irán no tiene nada que ver con el atentado a la AMIA”, Perfil, 7/3/2010; Oz, Fernando, “D'Elía lleva negocios a Irán y ya sueña con enriquecerle uranio”, Perfil, 3/4/2010; “D'Elía gestiona negocios para Irán y busca que la Argentina colabore en su polémico programa nuclear”, Infobae, 4/4/2010; “Desde el Líbano, D'Elía volvió a agredir a la comunidad judía”, Radio JAI, 29/03/2012; “D'Elía marchó por Palestina y desató polémica en Twitter”, Perfil, 29/03/2012). De hecho, a fines de febrero y principios de marzo de 2007, Luís D'Elía viajó a la República Islámica de Irán y se reunió, al menos, con dos de los imputados por el atentado contra la AMIA: Mohsen Rabbani y Ahmad Asghari, circunstancia que él mismo reconoció bajo juramento al prestar declaración testimonial ante el suscripto. En esa ocasión, también admitió que el viaje no había sido abonado de su peculio, sino que fue una invitación a participar de un seminario sobre América Latina y que “como en cualquier seminario internacional los gastos fueron abonados por el r país que invita” (declaración testimonial de Luis Angel D'Elía de fecha 08/05/2007, fs. 124.367/124.373 de los autos principales, fs. 17/23 del Legajo N°416). A su regreso de la nación asiática, D'Elía refirió que le habían entregado evidencias y documentación que demostraban que Irán no había tenido nada que ver con el atentado contra la AMIA y que la acusación de esta Unidad Fiscal estaba apoyaba en pruebas falsas (Obarrio, Mariano, “D'Elía prometió acercarse más a Irán”, La Nación, 28/02/2007; Galak, Oliver, “Escándalo en la Feria del Libro”, La Nación, 30/04/2007; “De regreso, D'Elía ratificó su respaldo a Irán”, La Nación, 2/3/2007). Consecuentemente, se sustanció una exhaustiva investigación siguiendo la información, los elementos y los testigos aportados por D'Elía. Inicialmente, D'Elía relativizó los trascendidos de la prensa, al explicar que las suyas no eran afirmaciones categóricas, sino que se trataba de una mera hipótesis elaborada en virtud de los elementos que le proveyeron en Irán y el consejo de sus abogados. La debilidad de sus argumentos quedó manifiesta cuando, al ser citado en declaración testimonial, D’Elía nada pudo corroborar ni aportar elemento alguno que diera apoyo a sus especulaciones. Incluso admitió no haber leído nunca el expediente y reconoció que sus afirmaciones no eran tales, sino meras especulaciones. De hecho, las mismas fueron desestimadas hasta por sus propios testigos. A fin de cuentas quedó claramente comprobado que la versión brindada por D'Elía no encontraba apoyo, ni siquiera, en los elementos y medidas de prueba que él mismo había propuesto. Y, en consecuencia, se dio por finalizada esa línea de investigación, concluyéndose que “la versión esbozada por Luis D'Elía, huérfana de todo sustento, queda reducida a una teoría disparatada y antojadiza que cae por su propio peso y no amerita un mayor análisis” (fs. 379/381 del Legajo 416). En concreto, en aquella ocasión quedó desvirtuado lo que podría interpretarse como un intento, burdo por cierto, de desincriminar a los imputados iraníes de toda participación en el atentado contra la AMIA en el que también estuvo involucrado Luis D'Elía. No ha de extrañar entonces que nuevas maniobras destinadas a desvincular a los acusados iraníes de las imputaciones que se les formulan en la causa por el atentado vuelvan a tener al Sr. D’Elía como protagonista. Es más, su cercanía al gobierno de Cristina Fernández y sus lazos con Irán lo convirtieron en un personaje casi imprescindible en esta trama delictiva. Cabe recordar que D'Elía llegó calificarse a sí mismo como “un soldado” incondicional de la Presidente. En los meses de febrero y marzo de 2010, Luis D’Elía volvió a visitar Irán. Esta vez lo hizo acompañado de Alicia Sánchez, Fernando Esteche, Jorge Rachid, Mario Codarín y Abdul Karim Paz (Santiago Paz Bullrich). La visita tuvo por objeto participar del 31° aniversario de la Revolución Islámica y fue una invitación del gobierno iraní, que alojó a toda la comitiva en la Casa de Huéspedes de la cancillería persa (“Quejas de Israel por el viaje de D'Elia a Irán”, La Nación, 07/03/2010; “D'Elía admitió un encuentro con un ex funcionario iraní prófugo en la causa AMIA”, La Prensa, 07/03/2010; “D’Elía y Esteche vieron en Irán a un sospechoso de volar la AMIA”, Perfil, 06/03/2010). Fue en esta ocasión, en la que los iraníes le ofrecieron un acuerdo de similares características al que terminó firmando Héctor Timerman. “...Es parecido a lo que nos propusieron en el primer viaje a Teherán ¿te acordás(Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado N°11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27- 174637-12, CD 266). En aquella oportunidad, D'Elía volvió a reunirse con Mohsen Rabbani. Esta vez, con la participación de Fernando Esteche y de Abdul Karim Paz, entre otros (“D'Elía admitió un encuentro con un ex funcionario iraní prófugo en la causa AMIA”, La Prensa, 07/03/2010; “D’Elía y Esteche vieron en Irán a un sospechoso de volar la AMIA”, Perfil, 06/03/2010; “D'Elía sigue defendiendo al prófugo de la AMIA: Es una buena persona”, Clarín, 09/03/2010; “Diputados repudió el viaje de D’Elía a Irán y pidió informes a Cancillería”, Infobae, 07/04/2010). Durante años, como se adelantó, D’Elía ha mantenido un estrecho contacto con Mohsen Rabbani, con quien se reunió en todas las ocasiones en que fue invitado a la República Islámica de Irán y a quien entrevistó en más de una oportunidad en su radio, en exclusiva, cuando Rabbani ya estaba prófugo (entrevistas radiales de Luis D'Elía a Mohsen Rabbani de fechas 9/3/2010 y 6/4/2011, “Siete punto cero”, Radio Cooperativa AM 770; “D'Elía y Esteche vieron en Irán a un sospechoso del atentado a la AMIA”, Perfil, 6/03/2010; “D'Elía, más lejos: Irán no tiene nada que ver con el atentado a la AMIA”, Perfil, 7/3/2010; “D'Elía no cometió delito al reunirse con los iraníes”, Crítica, 8/3/2010; “Rabbani le r confirmó a D'Elía que no declarará en la causa AMIA”, Ambito Financiero, 9/3/2010; Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, “D'Elía sigue defendiendo al prófugo de la AMIA: es una buena persona”, Clarín, 9/3/2010; “Rabbani advirtió que hay muchos negocios atrás de la causa AMIA”, Página 12, 9/3/2010; Oz, Fernando, “D'Elía lleva negocios a Irán y ya sueña con enriquecerle uranio”, Perfil, 3/4/2010; “D'Elía gestiona negocios para Irán y busca que la Argentina colabore en su polémico programa nuclear”, Infobae, 4/4/2010). Esta invitación a la República Islámica de Irán no fue casual. Lo invitaron para ir adelantándole la solución política y la desvinculación del tema AMIA y así dejar de lado las acusaciones de la justicia argentina y -fundamentalmente- la baja de las notificaciones rojas, en línea con lo históricamente postulado por Teherán. En su entorno, se destacan figuras como el ex embajador venezolano en Argentina, Roger Capella. Durante su estadía en Argentina, el Embajador Roger Capella trabó una aceitada relación con distintas agrupaciones sociales argentinas, financiando a referentes como Luis D'Elía y Fernando Esteche con viajes, becas y otros recursos. (Gallo, Daniel, “Controvertida agenda política del Embajador de Venezuela”, La Nación, 16/11/2006). Cabe recordar además que Capella fue quien en noviembre de 2006 incitó a Luis D'Elía a realizar la protesta en contra de la justicia argentina por el caso AMIA, que le costó su espacio en el gobierno de Kirchner (“Kirchner ordenó expulsar a D'Elía del gobierno”, La Nación, 14/11/2006; Gallo, Daniel, “Controvertida agenda política del Embajador de Venezuela”, La Nación 16/11/2006). Ahora bien, la consustanciación de D'Elía con el régimen iraní motivó que siguiera las pautas de la estrategia comunicacional orquestada desde Teherán y que haya sido fuertemente crítico con la investigación llevada a cabo por las autoridades judiciales argentinas y con sus funcionarios, cuestionando su integridad y argumentando que la acusación contra los nacionales iraníes es falsa y ha sido inventada por intereses, presiones e interferencias de sectores y agencias norteamericanas e israelíes (Ver Comunicado del 13 de noviembre de 2006, firmado por Luis D'Elía y Juan José Cantiello, entregado al entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Buenos Aires, Mohsen Baharvand; Wiñazki, Verónica, “Desde Irán, D'Elía aseguró que apoyaría la pena de muerte a los responsables de la AMIA”, Perfil, 4/3/2010; “D'Elía, más lejos: Irán no tiene nada que ver con   Ministerio Público de la Nación el atentado a la AMIA”, Perfil, 7/3/2010; “D'Elía no cometió delito al reunirse con los iraníes”, Crítica, 8/3/2010; Entrevista en el programa “DATA” de Rodolfo Barili, Canal Metro, 27/03/2010; “Causa AMIA: Para D'Elía, los acusados iraníes van a ser sobreseídos”, Infobae, 1/3/2013; Discurso de Luis D'Elía en el Acto por el Día Internacional del Al Quds o Día Internacional de la solidaridad iraní por la liberación de Palestina, Mezquita At-Tauhid, 2/8/2013; “D'Elía satisfecho tras el giro de Cristina con Irán, insiste con defender a los acusados por AMIA”, La Nación, 26/09/2012; Dinatale, Martín. “D'Elía y Esteche reivindicaron a la agrupación terrorista Hezbollah”, La Nación, 13/08/2013). Tal postura pública le costó, como ya se expuso, su cargo como Subsecretario Nacional de Tierras para el Hábitat Social. En relación a aquel distanciamiento, el propio D'Elía declaró: “...fue un momento muy duro para mí... ”, pero aclaró: “...nunca me fui del kirchnerismo, seguí militando y acompañando como lo hice siempre....'” (“Causa AMIA: Para D'Elía, los acusados iraníes van a ser sobreseídos”, Infobae, 1/3/2013). Sin embargo, más allá de haber dejado la función pública, D'Elía siguió muy vinculado al gobierno, actuando desde la Federación de Tierras y Viviendas. Mantuvo su cuota de poder dentro de la estructura gubernamental nacional y preservó sus contactos, lo que le permitió seguir operando. Su actividad pareció desplegar mayor intensidad y/o visibilidad durante el último mandato de Cristina Fernández. Su injerencia en la cuestión de tierras y viviendas se ve corroborada, por ejemplo, en las palabras de Jorge Khalil quien, hablando con otro miembro de la comunidad iraní local, afirmó: “Recién salgo de donde Luis...le pedí hectáreas para nosotros, me las va a dar ahora...para hacer un predio para nosotros....” (Comunicación del 13/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-13-124515-18, CD 283). Y en otra ocasión le refirió a D'Elía: “...yo ya te había dicho que yo fui ahí a Corrientes, a la subsecretaría, a que avances con esos... ”, en alusión a negocios previos entre ambos (Comunicación del 5/3/2013, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-03-05-231220-24.wav, CD 303). Es decir, que aun fuera de la función oficial, D'Elía ha seguido moviendo los hilos en la Subsecretaría Nacional de Tierras, operando y disponiendo de predios del Estado, como si continuase ejerciendo la función pública de facto. Al respecto, cabe recordar que en el año 2008 la ex Subsecretaría de Tierras para el Hábitat Social que había dependido de Luis D'Elía en el año 2006, pasó a llamarse Comisión Nacional de Tierras para el Hábitat Social “Padre Carlos Mujica” y a depender de la Jefatura de Gabinete de Ministros de Presidencia de la Nación (Decretos N° 172/2006 del 20/02/2006 y 341/2008 del 3/3/2008). La citada comisión tiene su sede en Av. Corrientes 1302 piso 2do. de la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires y hace años se encuentra presidida por el Arquitecto Rubén Pascolini quien, a su vez, y junto con la gran mayoría de los directivos de dicha comisión, es miembro de la asociación civil “Federación de Tierra, Vivienda y Hábitat” que preside, justamente, Luis D'Elía (sitios oficiales: www.tierras.gob.ar y www.ftv.org.ar). Resumiendo. Pocas personas pueden acreditar tantas credenciales como Luis Ángel D’Elía para desempeñar el rol aquí denunciado. Ha sido un acérrimo defensor del régimen iraní y del gobierno nacional al punto de calificarse a sí mismo como “un soldado”. Así lo reconoció el propio D'Elía en una conversación con Khalil, en oportunidad en la que viajó a Venezuela con Cristina Fernández, a causa del fallecimiento de Presidente Hugo Chávez. En esa ocasión, expresó: “Yo me estoy yendo a Caracas temprano...Me voy con la Presidenta, Yuse...”. Luego, en relación a su ausencia en la conmemoración por la muerte de Chávez, ocurrida en la Embajada Venezolana en Buenos Aires, agregó: “Yo tengo que hacer el juego de la Rosada, papá. Si tengo orden de no ir, soy un soldado acá, ¿entendés?” (Comunicación del 05/03/2013, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-03-05-231220-24.wav, CD 303). Efectivamente: un soldado, que viaja como parte de la comitiva presidencial para acompañar a la Sra. Presidente en su visita de condolencia por el fallecimiento de un mandatario extranjero. Ahora bien, no puede extrañar que, con estas credenciales y decidido el acercamiento con Teherán -en función del plan criminal aquí expuesto-, haya desempeñado un rol fundamental como nexo, recibiendo y enviando mensajes secretos de las autoridades argentinas a Teherán, en distintas etapas de este sofisticado plan. Esto se verificó cuando el acuerdo aun se estaba negociando, luego de haberse firmado el memorando, cuando éste quedó trabado por el desinterés de Irán y cuando se montó una puesta en escena para simular una salida dialogada a las desaveniencias surgidas. Incluso, ha sido partícipe de las negociaciones comerciales ligadas al plan, que involucraron al imputado Mohsen Rabbani. No pueden interpretarse de otro modo los constantes contactos telefónicos y personales que ha tenido con Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, un pilar de la comunidad iraní en Buenos Aires y la voz más alta de Irán en Argentina en todo lo concerniente al tema AMIA; las reuniones que ha mantenido con el Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina; su participación en la digitación de las actividades de grupos locales de apoyo a Irán; la “regulación” de sus apariciones y declaración públicas por parte del entorno presidencial y el asiduo contacto con el Diputado Andrés Larroque, quien opera como su principal -aunque no única- vía de contacto con la Sra. Presidente. Cabe recordar que la intermediación de Larroque entre Cristina y D’Elía quedó evidenciada ante la opinión pública en general cuando se publicó que el Diputado le había transmitido a D'Elía el siguiente mensaje: “Dice Cristina que no hables más hasta las elecciones” (“Cristina furiosa con D'Elía: No hables más hasta las elecciones”, La Política On Line, 26/9/2013). Esta información periodística se condice en un todo con los datos que surgen de las conversaciones telefónicas registradas, en tanto corroboran que Larroque es el intermediario entre la Dra. Fernández y D'Elía y que a través suyo ha entrado y salido la información al despacho presidencial, al menos en varios episodios relacionados con los hechos aquí denunciados. En este sentido, corresponde repetir que Luis D’Elía no es una persona simplemente alineada con Cristina Fernández por mera afinidad en relación al caso AMIA, sino que se trata de uno de sus operadores, alguien que trabaja para sus intereses, al que se le imparten instrucciones y que responde sin cuestionamientos. No se eligió a cualquiera como intermediario para avanzar en la negociación con Irán, eligieron a un “soldado”. A continuación, se expondrán distintos episodios que permiten ejemplificar el rol de Luis D'Elía en este entramado. Primero, corresponde reiterar las palabras de Jorge Khalil en noviembre de 2012: “...vengo de La Matanza recién he tenido una reunión con Luis D’Elía y el “Cuervo” Larroque, el de la Cámpora...que me llamaron temprano que querían hablar conmigo, que tenían un mensaje para el gobierno para dar... Y ahora me voy para Martínez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador...”, en referencia al Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, máxima autoridad oficial en territorio nacional (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-17-104846-10.wav, CD 195). Y al día siguiente: “...Me fui a La Matanza, estuve hablando con el Cuerno Larroque y con D'Elía...de ahí me tuve que ir a la casa del embajador a hablar con el embajador para mandar un mensaje que me mandaron...” (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18- 100116-6, CD 196). Segundo. El día 27 de enero de 2013, luego de que el canciller Timerman firmara el pacto con Irán, el entonces Secretario General de la Presidencia, Oscar Parrilli, se comunicó con Luis D'Elía para informarle esa circunstancia y, además, le pidió que por unos diez días mantenga un perfil bajo y no realice declaraciones públicas (Comunicación del 27/01/13, abonado N°11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-174637-12, CD 266 y Comunicación del 28/01/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2013-01-28-135905-20, CD 267). Si Luis D’Elía no formase parte del grupo que ejecutó el encubrimiento, esta comunicación carecería de todo I.BEWTO i ISCAL GENEíiAL sentido pues no siendo funcionario del gobierno ¿cuál sería el motivo para informarlo al instante de la firma del acuerdo y la razón para pedirle que mantenga silencio? Idéntico pedido de “silencio estratégico” le fue comunicado por “Alian”, pero esa vez por intermedio de Jorge Khalil: “...lo que le tenés que decir al negro...que esté tranquilo, 'por diez días no comentés nada'... ”. Y Khalil se lo transmitió a D'Elía: “...por las dudas que te llamen hoy los medios o alguno, tené perfil bajo, por diez días por lo menos... ”, a lo que éste respondió: “...bárbaro....me dijo Parrilli recién también. Dale...” (Comunicación del 28/01/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28- 135905-20, CD 267). Es forzoso concluir que la Dra. Fernández hizo llegar a D'Elía su indicación de “silencio estratégico”, tanto a través del Secretario General como de “Alian”. Y resulta una terrible paradoja que las autoridades del gobierno nacional se ocupen de informar personalmente a Luis D’Elía de la firma del Memorando mientras que tanto los familiares y víctimas del atentado como la dirigencia comunitaria hayan tenido que anoticiarse por los medios de comunicación. Tercero. En febrero de 2013, D'Elía le consiguió al entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán, Alí Pakdaman, la posibilidad de publicar una nota en la agencia oficial de noticias: “...en Télam, yo se la conseguí...él me llamó a mí para decirme que quería salir en Télam...y me llamó Baharvandpara decirme lo mismo...”, en referencia al diplomático iraní y anterior Encargado de Negocios apostado en Buenos Aires (Comunicación del 12/02/2013, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-12-185834-30, CD 282). De hecho, para articular ese pedido de la diplomacia iraní, D’Elía recurrió a sus contactos en el gobierno: “...yo se la conseguí, yo hablé con Rodra y el Cuervo...”, en alusión al entonces Subsecretario de Medios Rodrigo Rodríguez y al Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque (Comunicación del 12/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-12-185834-30, CD 282). Este tipo de episodios demuestran, una vez más, que las acciones de Luis D'Elía se encuentran destinadas a responder y atender a los intereses iraníes, en cumplimiento de las directivas emanadas de Presidencia de la Nación. Cuarto. En el acto del Día de Al Quds, Luis D'Elía reivindicó a Hezbollah y se jactó de sus contactos con la organización terrorista acusada de ejecutar el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA (Dinatale, Martín, “D'Elía y Esteche reivindicaron a la agrupación terrorista Hezbollah”, La Nación, 13/08/2013). Al elogiar a la organización terrorista libanesa, hizo referencia a su reciente viaje a la República del Líbano en marzo de 2012, donde visitó sitios propios de la organización y estuvo en contacto sus dirigentes (Discurso de Luis D'Elía en el Acto por el Día Internacional de Al Quds, Mezquita At-Tauhid, 02/08/2013). Según la información disponible, este viaje habría sido solventado por la organización “Free Palestiné’ (“Luis D'Elía desde Beirut, acompaña la Marcha Mundial a Jerusalén por Palestina. En Buenos Aires, se marchará desde el Obelisco, en www.luisdelia.org, 30/03/2012). Además, D'Elía le agradeció a los referentes de Irán en Argentina “...la posibilidad de conocer el Líbano...de estar en contacto con los dirigentes de Hezbollah...” (Discurso de Luis D'Elía en el Acto por el Día Internacional de Al Quds, Mezquita At-Tauhid, 02/08/2013). Sus declaraciones dejan en evidencia las intenciones de sus contactos iraníes al solventar dicha visita. Su militancia a favor de la referida organización terrorista llegó al punto de solicitarle a Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, que le facilite contactos con dirigentes de Hamas y Hezbollah, por razones periodísticas. En sus palabras, le pidió “...que le habilites contactos allá con Hezbollah y Hamas...”, aludiendo -justamente- a Hezbollah, cuyo involucramiento en el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA ha sido revelado por numerosos elementos probatorios en el marco de la causa (Comunicación del 24/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11 -24-134118- 12, CD 202). Quinto. Fue el encargado de transmitir la “desazón” de la República Islámica de Irán por el fracaso argentino en el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Ello surge explícito de la prueba obtenida y aquí detallada. Khalil: Yyyyy...hay un poquito de....esto entre nosotros, hay un poquito de desazón de allá, de allá, no sé porque, hay desazón. D’Elía: ¿¡Desazón!? Khalil: Desazón, sí, sí, sí. No gustó algunas palabras que se dijeron eh, me parece... D’Elía: Ajá Khalil: Me parece que el ruso este de mierda'9 se mandó alguna. D’Elía: Ah ¿sil Khalil: Si, sí D’Elía: ¿Qué dijo? Khalil: No... estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares  también parece, pero bueno lo hablamos personalmente. D’Elía: Bueno, dale, dale, dale. (Comunicación del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	05-11-083146-8.wav, CD 0022). Sexto. Luis D’Elía conocía perfectamente que uno de los intereses de las autoridades del gobierno argentino que había motivado la ejecución del plan de encubrimiento del que participó, ha sido principalmente comercial. Recuérdese la secuencia de comunicaciones mantenidas con Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil el día 20 de mayo de 2013. D’Elía: Estoy acá en la puerta de Planificación y entro a ver a Julio eh! Khalil: Bueno, bueno, 11ámame después. D’Elía: Le voy a tirar eso, eh, ¿dale? Khalil: Dale, si, si tranquilo. Transcurrida la reunión entre Luis D’Elía y el Ministro Julio De Vido, el primero volvió a comunicarse con Khalil: D’Elía: Bueno, mirá, acá estuve hablando con el ‘quía' Khalil: sí D’Elía: Ellos están dispuestos a mandar la gente de YPF con nosotros dos Khalil: si D’Elía: A hacer negocios allá. Khalil: Bien. D’Elía: Está muy interesado en intercambiar lo de aquellos por granos y carne allá eh. Khalil: Bueno. D’Elía: Y... ¿cómo es? Tiene un problema político, necesitan que se apruebe el memorándum ¿sí? Khalil: Y si, está clarito ese tema Luis...yo te lo dije el otro día, ¿Manifestaste lo que te dije? D’Elía: Si, yo les dije hace 10 días y me dijeron que en 30 días se aprobaba Khalil: No, no, yo te dije que el memorándum se iba a aprobar ...yo te lo dije a vos, pero que lo estaban retrasando por esa cuestión... D’Elía: No...no, ahí hubo alguna....conté lo que vos me contaste, el incidente que hubo Khalil: Si D’Elía: Y...la reunión fue porque lo pidió la jefa ¡eh! Khalil: Bueno. D’Elía: Estamos al más alto nivel. Khalil: quiere decir que estamos bien. D’Elía: Si, si, re bien	ahora, si a nosotros no nos aprueban el memo ese, quedamos como unos pelotudos allá ¿viste? Khalil: ¿Si no lo aprueban? Lo van a aprobar, eso lo van a aprobar... D’Elía: Bueno, pero a la brevedad lo tienen que aprobar, viste. Khalil: Lo van a aprobar Luis, vos sabés cómo son los tiempos en Persia y aparte la lógicas que no se cumplen, o sea....eehh...De Vido tiene que saber que “Timerman no cumplió con algunas cosas ”, esto es así de claro, no cumplió con algunas cosas... (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	05-20-111124-8, CD31). Los pormenores de esa reunión, que D'Elía transmitió a Jorge Khalil, llegaron ese mismo día a Teherán, cuando el referente local de Irán resumió: “...Acá hay luz verde para hacer las operaciones y mandar a la gente, el tema es que quieren que se apure el memorándum...En principio, deciles que el tema que necesita Argentina es petróleo, todo petróleo, y todo lo que está comprando...Irán en grano se lo pueden dar, ese petróleo a cambio de granos... ¿entendés?...y se habló con De Vido...que todo esto se habló con De Vido...Argentina tiene una gran necesidad de petróleo e Irán tiene una gran necesidad de granos y todo eso, empezar el intercambio. Eso por un lado. Por el otro lado, De Vido entiende que para dar un paso en esto...o sea oficial, de Estado a Estado, tiene que haber firma del memorándum, porque si no, siguen los privados, nada más ...como están ¡aburando...O sea, que se firme primero el memorándum para empezar a hacerlo de Estado a Estado, porque por ahora los únicos que están trabajando son los privados...” (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11 -3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-133130-8, CD 31). Séptimo. D’Elía ha jugado un rol fundamental en la “puesta en escena” articulada por las autoridades del gobierno argentino a finales del mes de septiembre de 2013 cuando, supuestamente, se esperaba que la República Islámica de Irán responda si el Memorando había sido aprobado o no por el régimen. La realidad de lo que ocurría está plasmada en las conversaciones telefónicas entre D’Elía y Khalil. 27 de septiembre de 2013. D’Elía: ...tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar allá, pero urgente, antes de mañana. Khalil: ¿Antes de mañana? ¿Dónde estás? D’Elía: Estoy en la casa de gobierno ahora. Khalil: Bueno, voy para aquellos lados. (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-103753-14, CD 161). En consecuencia, Khalil intentó ubicar al Encargado de Negocios iraní en Argentina para transmitirle el mensaje. Khalil: Escúchame, Mohsen, ¿el hombre este va a estar ahí? Mohsen Ali: El hombre va a estar ahí, pero tiene dos reuniones... Khalil: No, yo necesito sacarlo 15 minutos, necesito darle un mensaje, viejo. Mohsen Ali: Y por eso, pero ¿Cuándo? Khalil: Es del gobierno argentino, mandaron un mensaje para él. (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-104209-26, CD 161) En la siguiente comunicación se dijo: Mohsen Ali: Escúchame, dice el Embajador que prefiere verte a vos solo, porque te quiere hablar, no vengas con él, que venga más tarde. Khalil: No, yo puedo ir antes, el mensaje lo tiene él. Mohsen Alí: Antes... Khalil: Me llamó recién, llamaron de casa de gobierno, lo tiene él, el mensaje. Mohsen Ali: Claro, claro, pero dice que a vos te quiere ver para hablarte en privado. (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-104852-14.wav, CD 161). En definitiva, D'Elía fue a la Embajada de Irán y le pidió a Khalil que también transmitiera el mensaje directamente a Irán: quería que llegara personalmente a Mohsen Rabbani. D’Elía: Estoy en camino a la Embajada Yussef. Khalil: Está bien, andá tranquilo, yo llegué justo recién a Casa Rosada, andá tranquilo. D’Elía: Escúchame, veníporque necesito que hables con el Sheik alia ehl Khalil: Si, sí, sí, estoy con Rubén, ya llamamos al otro.  FISCAL  Ministerio Público de la Nación D’Elía: aaahh, ¿estás con Rubén? Me quedo tranquilo. Khalil: estoy con Rubén acá, estoy enterado de todo, quedate tranquilo. D’Elía: decile que....explícale que acá estamos [ininteligible] y necesitamos eso, ¿sabésl Khalil: listo, listo, listo. D’Elía: que mañana lo anuncien los dos eh... ¿tá? Khalil: Listo, listo, dale, abrazo. D’Elía: Listo, chau, abrazo. (Comunicaciones del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	09-27-114113-28, CD 161). En una posterior comunicación Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil reveló el mensaje. Khalil: Hola, ¿te digo lo que es? Karim Paz: Si. Khalil: Necesita que el gobierno iraní junto con el gobierno argentino mañana anuncie la conformación de la Comisión de la Verdad. Karim Paz: ajá... Khalil: Y...y eso. Que por favor lo anuncien en conjunto mañana en la reunión. Karim Paz: Hay que ver si los iraníes están preparados tan rápido, hay que ver... Khalil: No....yo que sé, eso es otro tema, yo te digo lo que quieren. Karim Paz: No sé, me parece que hicieron medio boludeces pero igual los iraníes tienen una paciencia de elefante, así que se la van a bancar. Khalil: Si, por eso. Karim Paz: ....quieren arreglar Khalil: Tranquilo. Karim Paz: Pero parece desprolijo, la Argentina se mueve ¿viste?, chupándole las medias a Estados Unidos, tiran problemas para Estados Unidos, pero se la van.... igual se la van a bancar todo, pero no creo que ya mañana anuncien que ya confirmaron. No creo que los iraníes vengan tan afilados de reunión, porque la reunión se hace de apuro a pedido de Cristina.... (Comunicación del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 09-27-115448-6, CD 161). En este punto, corresponde destacar el rol fundamental de D’Elía, al tratarse de la persona de la que se ha valido la Sra. Presidente y demás integrantes del plan criminal para transmitir los mensajes relativos a encaminar el encubrimiento destinado a dotar de impunidad a los acusados iraníes. En síntesis, los antecedentes de Luis D’Elía como acérrimo defensor y militante tanto del régimen iraní como del gobierno nacional lo han posicionado como la persona ideal para cumplir este plan de encubrimiento. Ya participaba del plan cuando el acuerdo aún se estaba negociando, cuando se firmó el Memorando de Entendimiento, cuando se lo trató en el Congreso Nacional, cuando quedó trabado por el desinterés de Irán, y cuando se montó una actuación entre las partes para simular que intentaban diplomáticamente acordar una salida dialogada a las desavenencias surgidas. En distintas instancias de este sofisticado delito ha realizado aportes fundamentales para su desarrollo. Recibió instrucciones de parte de Andrés Larroque. Se comunicó innumerables veces con el interlocutor del régimen iraní, Jorge Khalil, contactó al representante diplomático de Irán y abogó públicamente por la buena marcha del plan. Es decir, desde su posición, contribuyó constantemente al avance del delito. d)	Jorge Alejandro ""Yussuf"" Khalil Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil es el referente más importante de las autoridades del régimen iraní en Argentina. En ese carácter ha sido el nexo central en la vinculación entre autoridades iraníes y argentinas en el marco del accionar delictivo aquí denunciado. De hecho, en todo aquello relacionado con el plan de encubrimiento, Khalil ha contado con mucho más peso específico que los diplomáticos persas aquí apostados. Es decir, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil responde al régimen y ha actuado en todo momento conforme las directivas de Teherán. Ha sido la voz y los oídos de Irán en Argentina, ha transmitido los mensajes de sus autoridades y ha defendido los intereses iraníes ante los operadores locales y, al mismo tiempo, ha retransmitido las inquietudes y demandas de las autoridades argentinas a sus superiores en Irán. Khalil siempre fue consciente de su posición y la explicó manifestando: “yo soy orgánico le dije...a mí me dieron la orden de allá, no tengo que mover un dedo...no muevo un dedo” en alusión a que obedece enteramente a las indicaciones y directivas que recibe de Teherán (Comunicación del 6/6/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 06-06-092046-14, CD 48). Khalil es visto en la comunidad como “...el interlocutor ante la Embajada...” y así lo describió él mismo (Comunicación del 14/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-14-164341-10, CD 284). En otra ocasión se definió como el nexo entre funcionarios argentinos y la Embajada de Irán, al aclarar: “yo no estoy operando para ellos, yo estoy operando para los nuestros, para lo que es la embajada...ellos me mandaron a hacer una cosa, yo como soy el nexo...”, en clara referencia a Irán (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11 -18-100116-6, CD 196). Por si queda alguna duda sobre la importancia de Khalil como referente y nexo local para Teherán, en especial para este plan de impunidad, él mismo demostró su manejo y aclaró que no le importaba lo que dijera el entonces Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, máxima autoridad diplomática iraní en el país, Ali Pakdaman. En sus palabras: “...me chupa un huevo Pakdaman...” (Comunicación del 12/08/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-08-12-120458- 26, CD 115). Sin embargo, cabe aclarar que Khalil varía notablemente su modo de acoplarse a la actividad diplomática iraní de acuerdo al tema que esté tratándose, comportándose por momentos sumiso y en ocasiones desafiante y autónomo, lo que demuestra el significativo grado de independencia de sus canales de contacto y, fundamentalmente, de su respaldo en Teherán. Entre otros, se apoya en Mohsen Baharvand, antiguo Encargado de Negocios iraní en Argentina y actualmente encumbrado funcionario de la cancillería persa. Al respecto, ha dicho: “Baha sabe cómo me muevo y todo...qué lugares frecuento, él sabe todo, yo le cuento, le conté todo a él siempre”, en contraposición con la postura que asumió con uno de sus sucesores, Ali Pakdaman, sobre quien expresó: “...yo no se lo voy a decir al Safir, porque el Safir va y lo vende...” (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-04-130024-6, CD 182). A días de firmarse el acuerdo con Irán, Pakdaman lo convocó para decirle: “...usted tiene que ir a Irán porque Baharvand le quiere informar cómo van las cosas, cómo van a seguir...y aparte el sheik [por Mohsen Rabbani] va a decir delante de todos que todos lo sigan a usted...”, lo que demuestra tanto su estrecha vinculación con la diplomacia iraní como -fundamentalmente- la confianza y cercanía con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani (Comunicación del 14/02/2013, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341 -10, CD 284). Pero más allá de ciertas tensiones, queda claro que Khalil es autónomo y con poder propio respecto de la diplomacia formal iraní, a la cual elude según sus instrucciones, “....yo lo puenteé porque a mí me dijeron que yo tengo que hacer las cosas y bueno...las hago. Aparte hablé con el jefe de él, si tiene algún problema que se lo diga al jefe de éT (Comunicación del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-133130-8, CD31) Tampoco resulta ocioso agregar que el actual Encargado de Negocios iraní en Argentina consiguió su cargo gracias a la gestión y venia del propio Khalil, quién lo confesó expresando: “...el embajador quedó muy contento, es un embajador que eh...yo lo veo muy potable de todos los embajadores que vinieron, yo con el que mejor trabajo es éste...es un embajador que elegí. Cuando a mí me preguntaron ¿fulano, mengano o zutano? Dije fulano y yo se lo dije a este embajador ¿usted sabe que le puse yo el dedo a usted? Me dice si, si, si, yo le quiero agradecer porque habló por mí, que esto que lo otro. Porque el jefe de él, era íntimo amigo mío, es íntimo amigo mío y la verdad que es el que está llevando las negociaciones con argentina” (Comunicación del 29/11/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-11 -29-131946-2, CD 224). A mayor abundamiento, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil considera al actual Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, un “amigo” (Comunicación del 4/7/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-07-04-004323-8, CD 76), lo que se evidencia en ciertos gestos, por ejemplo, que el diplomático le ha prestado su automóvil para que viaje a la provincia de La Pampa (Comunicación del 24/1/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01 -24-184418-16, CD 280). Otro rasgo de importancia para entender el peso de Khalil en este plan criminal, gira en torno a su vinculación con el acusado Mohsen Rabbani, con quien se comunica telefónicamente y por correo electrónico en forma asidua y con quien se ha venido relacionando desde la época del atentado contra la AMIA: “...te estoy hablando del 93, del 94, cuando explotó la bomba...” (Comunicación del 6/6/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-06-092046-14, CD 48). Khalil sigue recibiendo órdenes del iraní y transmitiéndole periódicamente las novedades de la causa AMIA. Nótese en la siguiente conversación la absoluta fidelidad de Khalil respecto de Rabbani. El 27 de febrero de 2013, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, en ocasión del tratamiento parlamentario del Memorando de Entendimiento, habló con Rabbani y expresó: Khalil: Están en el Congreso, están....están tratando el tema a ver si Ud. va preso, no va preso, y lo que menos nos va a dar bola [ininteligible] va a ser hoy... Rabbani: Defendernos [ininteligible] Khalil: ...lo vamos a defender nosotros, en el congreso, adentro de la cárcel, afuera, en todos lados si Dios quiere, porque nosotros somos los mismo, usted y la comunidad ésta, es lo mismo...si acusan a un iraní, si acusan a un iraní van a tener que acusar a toda la comunidad islámica del país, así de corta se lo digo. Rabbani: ¿qué pasó ahora? ¿Está muy caliente el asunto ese, no? Khalil: Uh, sí está muy caliente, está muy caliente, pero demasiado...yo le estoy mandando los mails, ¿no le llegaron las noticias? Rabbani: Si, si, Yussef gracias. Khalil: Le estoy mandando todos los días, de todos los diarios. (Comunicación del 27/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 02-27-125331-24, CD 297). Existen varios ejemplos de estas comunicaciones entre Khalil y Rabbani, que permiten acreditar fundadamente que Khalil se ha ocupado denodadamente en mantener informado al imputado Mohsen Rabbani de cada aspecto vinculado a su situación procesal, a la causa AMIA en general, al acercamiento de Teherán con Buenos Aires y, naturalmente, al Memorando de Entendimiento, vía para la impunidad del nombrado Rabbani (Comunicación del 27/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2013-02-27-125331-24, CD 297; Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31; Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 05-28-155549-2, CD 39; Comunicación del 24/11/13, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-11-24-103813-4, CD 219 y Comunciación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-04-093431-30, CD 291). Es decir, Khalil le ha reportado directa y continuamente a Mohsen Rabbani, imputado judicialmente por el atentado terrorista contra la AMIA, con pedido de captura nacional e internacional y notificación roja de Interpol vigentes, y beneficiario directo de la maniobra de encubrimiento aquí denunciada. Asimismo, le ha enviado todo tipo de información de su interés y, además, le he hecho saber los datos -públicos y secretos- que recabó de sus fuentes locales, ya sea que provengan de operadores con llegada al despacho presidencial, como el caso del Diputado Larroque; de actores relevantes que responden a los servicios de inteligencia locales como ocurre con “Alian” e Yrimia; y/o de históricos aliados locales de Teherán, como son D'Elía y Esteche. Ejemplo de ello, el 20 de mayo de 2013, luego de la reunión que mantuvo Luis D’Elía con Julio De Vido sobre los deseados negocios con Irán, Khalil inmediatamente llamó a Mohsen Rabbani para informarle lo ocurrido: Khalil: ...hoy terminamos lina reunión con el Ministro de Planificación De Vido, en donde él está dispuesto a mandar a las máximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la República Islámica y la transacción puede ser a través de granos y a través de otras cosas...bueno es cuestión de verlo. Rabbani: Mandamepara que evalúe. Khalil: ...yo le mando un mail, bien serio, de cómo fue la conversación y usted evalúa. Rabbani: entonces ¿entiende que es seguro las operaciones? Khalil: Seguro, seguro....si, sí, todo es sobre seguro, Agha, quédese tranquilo que estamos trabajando bien. (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-114842-2, CD31). Como se dijo anteriormente, mientras la justicia nacional acusa fundadamente a ciertos funcionarios iraníes de haber decidido, planificado y ejecutado el atentado terrorista contra la sede de la AMIA en el corazón de la capital, uno de esos imputados, Mohsen Rabbani, negocia con autoridades de nuestro país, a través de intermediarios y canales ocultos, intercambios comerciales de granos y de armamento. Corresponde agregar que no solamente lo ha mantenido informado, cumpliendo con las indicaciones directas de Rabbani, sino que existen pruebas que demuestran que ha procurado transmitirle tranquilidad en distintas fases del avance del encubrimiento, como por ejemplo, al aseverar: “...va a salir todo bien, quédese tranquilo que todo va a salir bien...” (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31). Así, le ha llevado tranquilidad a uno de los imputados por el atentado: “...Sheik, quédese tranquilo que yo hoy a la noche, cuando llego a mi casa, le mando un informe de todo todo lo que estoy haciendo...”, demostrando -una vez más- su subordinación a Mohsen Rabbani (Comunicación del 20/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-20-160302-28, CD 276). La confianza de Rabbani en Khalil se demostró también, por ejemplo, cuando, luego de una discusión entre ambos y ante el ofuscamiento de Khalil, Rabbani se disculpó diciéndole: “lo maltrato a usted en la confianza porque usted es responsable de todo” (Comunicación del 13/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l 009-2013-02-13-184206- 28, CD 283 y del Comunicación del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l 009-2013-02-14-164341-10, CD 284). O cuando Rabbani le dijo:	“...no mezcle más las cosas. Usted trabaja conmigo...” (Comunicación del 24/11/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-11-24-103813-4, CD 219) y cuando determinó “...dígale que coordinó conmigo el viaje...” (Comunciación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-l009-2014-02-04-093431-30, CD 291). Además, estos contactos demuestran acabadamente que Mohsen Rabbani, desde Irán, sigue decidiendo y operando en el máximo nivel para el régimen de Teherán, a través de referentes de su máxima confianza, como es el caso de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, quien recibe financiamiento enviado por Rabbani para sustentar la estructura que el encausado supo construir en territorio argentino durante la década que precedió al atentado contra la sede de la AMIA y que continua sosteniendo hasta la fecha con la asistencia de su entorno (Comunicación del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31, Comunicación del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 05-28-155549-2, CD 39; Comunicación del 19/01/2014, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-19-002737-2, CD 275; Comunicación del 20/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-20-160302- 28, CD 276; Comunicación del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2014-02-04-093431 -30, CD 291). La participación de Jorge Khalil en las tratativas, contactos y comunicaciones que viabilizaron el plan de encubrimiento, está reconocida por el mismo, cuando sostuvo a sólo cinco días de la firma del memorándum: “...fijóte con quién se está arreglando el gobierno”, en alusión al acercamiento entre Argentina e Irán, y agregó: “...estoy en esa maniobra...” (Comunicación del 3/2/2013, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-02-03-141619-26, CD 273). Todo lo expuesto corrobora que en las citadas tratativas, Khalil ha participado, representando y operando por Mohsen Rabbani, pero -fundamentalmente- como referente del régimen de Teherán. Por otra parte, Jorge Khalil ha tenido una participación clave en el armado de la pista falsa para desviar la investigación judicial del caso AMIA y desvincular definitivamente a los imputados iraníes. En ese sentido, fue quien se mantuvo en contacto telefónico constante con “Alian”, agente de la Secretaría de Inteligencia encargado de elaborar la nueva hipótesis. Y mucho antes de firmarse el acuerdo, Khalil ya trabajaba en el tema, junto con Fernando Esteche, quien también aportó ideas para fabricar la versión alternativa que explique el atentado. En los últimos meses del año 2012, Esteche había sugerido la incorporación al plan del ex fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA, Héctor Yrimia, con quien - siguiendo esta recomendación- se empezó a reunir Jorge Khalil en noviembre de 2012. Sumar a Yrimia tuvo por fin que la versión construida resulte verosímil y permita con mayor efectividad el deslinde de los iraníes. Sabía perfectamente, para ello había trabajado, que vendría “otra hipótesis, con otras pruebas ”, que se pretendía descolocar al suscripto y ridiculizar a la actual investigación del caso usando pruebas desconocidas para el expediente judicial; y que la “Comisión de la Verdad” no había sido creada para investigar, sino que estaba destinada -justamente- a desvincular a los iraníes:“...alguien va a salir...con la cara manchada de acá...Obvio, eso ya está arreglado... ¿Cómo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo? Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa...” (Comunicación del 27/1/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266; y Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). De hecho, una parte importante de las pruebas que aquí se aportan y que han permitido descubrir y denunciar esta maniobra criminal, son las comunicaciones telefónicas mantenidas por Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil e intervenidas judicialmente en la causa AMIA. Esto significa que, la participación y conocimiento que de los hechos ha tenido Khalil no solo fundan la imputación en su contra, sino que también han permitido al suscripto obtener la información suficiente como para revelar y comprobar el plan de impunidad ejecutado. Resumiendo. Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil ha sido una pieza de importancia fundamental en la ejecución del plan criminal de encubrimiento pergeñado por las más altas autoridades del gobierno argentino. Se trata del referente político local del gobierno de Irán, completamente consustanciado con las ideas y la política del régimen. Militante a tiempo completo de los intereses persas ha sido el clandestino interlocutor iraní en Buenos Aires para cumplir con el iter criminis de la impunidad. Al no tener una función oficial, su figura ha encajado a la perfección en esa tarea, oficiando de canal de comunicación para recibir y entregar los mensajes secretos y clandestinos que se enviaron encubridores y encubiertos. Por lo demás, motorizó la finalidad mediata del encubrimiento, esto es, el intercambio comercial a nivel estatal entre Argentina e Irán. En esa línea tendió numerosos puentes entre agentes gubernamentales y operadores iraníes, el más importante de los cuales puede resumirse en el interés de intercambiar “petróleo por granos” comunicado por parte del Ministro Julio De Vido, en cumplimiento de órdenes emanadas de Cristina Fernández.       ALBERTO N!SM<írg Ministerio Público de la Nación	fiscal general./ Asimismo y como ya se señaló, participó del armado de la hipótesis alternativa y su aporte resultó fundamental en la buena marcha del plan de encubrimiento. e)	""Alian ”, miembro de la Secretaría de Inteligencia. respecto de quien hay fuertes indicios que su nombre verdadero sería Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. En la ejecución del plan criminal, la persona identificada como “Alian” cumplió un rol imprescindible. En su condición de funcionario de la Secretaría de Inteligencia, con llegada directa al entorno presidencial, ha sido un actor clave en la interacción entre las altas figuras gubernamentales involucradas en los hechos. Es decir, ha sido especialmente seleccionado para instrumentar, materializar y llevar adelante los designios criminales de la Sra. Presidente y del Sr. Canciller. En primer lugar, corresponde dejar aclarado que “Alian” podría tratarse del Sr. Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. Sin haberse realizado medidas probatorias intrusivas que permitan develar esta cuestión, por considerar que las mismas corresponden a las autoridades judiciales que intervengan en la denuncia que aquí se radica, se pudo obtener la siguiente información:  2)	En la red social “Sónico” fue posible hallar una titularidad de cuenta que coincide con el encabezamiento de la dirección de mail “allanbogad”, igual a la que envió “Alian” a Khalil (se adjuntan impresiones correspondientes a la cuenta “allanbogad” en red social “Sónico”). 3)	De una comunicación telefónica surge que “Alian” sería oriundo de la Provincia de Misiones. En efecto, en referencia al Senador Nacional por Misiones, Juan Manuel Irrazábal, Khalil le dijo a “Alian”: “te vas a llevar bien con él porque es de tu provincia” (Comunicación del 5/12/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-12-05-192539-18, CD 230). 4)	En publicaciones necrológicas de un periódico de la Provincia de Misiones, que comunica el deceso de “Alian Héctor Bogado” -quien falleciera, según los datos obtenidos, a los 78 años de edad-, se identifican a varios de sus familiares y allegados. Su nombre, casi homónimo de la persona de interés en esta pesquisa, permite presumir -a priori- cierta vinculación familiar entre ambos, reforzando la hipótesis que el contacto de Khalil, “Alian” de Misiones, podría ser “Ramón Héctor Alian Bogado” (se adjuntan impresiones de los avisos necrológicos del diario “El Territorio” publicados en 29 y 30 de agosto de 2013). 5)	En el mismo periódico misionero se observan fotografías que ilustran a un hombre de mediana edad, a quien se identifica como “Alian Bogado”. En la fotografía se encuentra acompañado de otras personas, cuyos nombres coinciden con algunos de los contactos de la cuenta “allanbogad” de la red social “Sónico” y con varios de los deudos del fallecido “Alian Héctor Bogado” (“Mirando el río”, El Territorio, versión digital, del 6/02/2006). En base a todos estos indicios es dable sospechar que “Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado” podría ser la identidad del contacto de Khalil nombrado en las comunicaciones telefónicas como “Alian”, sin perjuicio de lo cual, naturalmente, se trata de una circunstancia más a ser corroborada por el magistrado interviniente en el marco de los hechos aquí denunciados. Más allá de la correcta identificación de este sujeto, lo cierto es que se trata de un miembro de la Secretaría de Inteligencia que se ha pronunciado y ha actuado, en reiteradas ocasiones, a favor de intereses extranjeros en detrimento de los nacionales. Que ha transmitido informaciones secretas y protegidas por la ley de inteligencia a agentes de una potencia extranjera. Que ha trabajado y negociado la impunidad de los prófugos de la causa AMIA. En ese rol no hesitó en transmitir información sensible y clasificada a la contraparte iraní. Tampoco dudó en contribuir al armado de una “pista falsa” con pruebas falsas ni en conspirar contra las autoridades judiciales a cargo de la investigación y, menos aún, en utilizar los resortes del estado nacional para establecer buenas relaciones con la comunidad iraní, articularle favores y allanar cualquier obstáculo que surgiera durante la ejecución del plan de encubrimiento. El hecho de que lo haya efectuado cumpliendo órdenes superiores en nada lo exculpa. Profundizando lo afirmado, en primer lugar corresponde hacer notar que los elementos colectados indican que “Alian” trabaja para la Secretaría de Inteligencia. Su pertenencia a dicho organismo queda fuera de discusión por su propia confesión y por la información que maneja. Préstese atención a la siguiente conversación entre “Alian” y Khalil, mantenida el 2 de junio de 2013. Khalil: Dos cositas... ¿cómo ves el cambio que hubo en el gobierno? La ida de la mujer2'. “Alian”: No hubo cambios. Khalil: ¿Cómo no? ¿No sacaron a los ministros? “Alian” Pero hubo cambio de nombres, no de situación. Khalil: No, no, pero el cambio de nombre, especialmente el de la mina, ¿cómo lo ves? “Alian”: Y...para nosotros, adentro....donde yo trabajo es complicado. Para ellos, donde están, es lo mismo, el que estaba /aburando era el Loco ... Khalil: “ah ok....mañana quiero una charla con vos en algún momento “Alian”: sí, sí. Yo te lo digo claro, el Director de Interior nuestro estaba 23 porque es el novio de la hija de la señora que se fue... Khalil: Si, ¿pero vos crees que la sacaron a la que se fue? Te pregunto eso concretamente... “AlianAh, porque ahora viene todo un tema interno. Ella estaba con su amigo Milán i, que tiene una inteligencia paralela... eh.... (Comunicación del 2/6/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-02-221245-20, CD 44). En otra oportunidad, “Alian” dijo: “...Tengo un chisme...me dijeron ahí en 'la casa' ...Interpol va a levantar el pedido de captura de los amigos...Lo va a levantar ahora... ”, aludiendo a la Secretaría de Inteligencia como “la casa” (Conversación del 25/2/13, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-25-151137-12, CD 295). Y	sus propios interlocutores se encuentran en conocimiento de que cumple funciones en el organismo de inteligencia nacional. Por ejemplo, Esteche señaló: “ ...Alian” lo podría resolver, si es un interés, si es un interés de inteligencia... ” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226) y Khalil expresó: “...le fueron a hacer 'rancho' a ese ""Alian” y a toda esa banda...nada, fueron a protestar ahí a 25 de Mayo24... ” (Comunicación del 17/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-17-134828-28, CD 89) y se refirió a “Alian” como “el Jefe de la SIDE”, destacando que éste le había mencionado “una interna fuerte entre ellos”, entendiéndose por ese “ellos” a los servicios de inteligencia (Comunicaciones del 1/06/2013, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo 224753, CD 0086; Archivo 61.30373.20130601.22551 1, CD 0086). Sumado a este significativo conjunto de indicios, el mismo “Alian” mencionó viajar a la zona de Triple Frontera en la etapa culmine de las negociaciones con Irán, circunstancia por demás llamativa, que no cabe soslayar en este análisis (Comunicación del 22/11/2012, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11 -22-121757-24, CD 200). Por otra parte, se han registrado referencias que indican que el Dr. Héctor Yrimia responde al mismo sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia que “Alian”, quien lo describe así: “...Yrimia...es empleado mío ese...” (Comunicación del 7/10/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-10-07-141519-20, CD 171). Además posee estrecha vinculación con la agrupación oficialista “La Cámpora”, la cual se vislumbra en distintas piezas probatorias. Por ejemplo, la conversación que mantuvo con Khalil en la que sostuvo: “ ...me vinieron a ver los pibes de La Cámpora....quieren pegarse un acercamiento con ustedes” (Comunicación del 6/2/2013, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276). En otra oportunidad, más precisamente el 24 de mayo de 2013, vísperas de una marcha por el aniversario de la Revolución de Mayo, explicó: “...yo tengo que organizar que la columna de La Cámpora llegue bien adelante, así que a las 11 nos juntamos en la central, que es Piedras y Chile. De ahí los saco y nos metemos todos ahí adentro con los pendejos, una vez que termine, me voy...’’'’ (Comunicación del 24/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-24-175330-20.txt, CD 35). También pertenece al más íntimo entorno presidencial. Al respecto, cabe recordar cuando Fernando Esteche le sugirió a Khalil que exija algunos gestos del gobierno, que involucren personalmente a la Dra. Fernández, para lo que aclaró: “...que la Presidenta vaya...eso es más fácil para Alian...”, dejando entrever nuevamente el acceso estratégico de “Alian” al entorno de la Dra. Fernández (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Prueba de la cercanía de “Alian” al entorno presidencial es la información que éste maneja. El 24 de mayo de 2013 le manifestó a Khalil: “Te cuento la doctora está con gripe y está con una fiebre de la puta madre. Así que está con un quilombo de la puta madre, a ver si mañana arranca para hablar....si va a hablar, va a hablar de última....después de las cuatro o	cinco” (Comunicación del 24/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-24-175330-20.txt, CD 35). El 7 de octubre de 2013, Khalil y “Alian” hablaron de la salud de la Sra. Presidente. “Alian”: y...tiene un coágulo viste, casi seguro que la operan...Ella se da cuenta el sábado cuando empezó a hacer gimnasia. Khalil: ¿se iba para un costado? “Alian”: le empezó a pie... ¿viste cuando se te duerme la mano?...que te da picazón. ¡Ypensaron que era del corazón y salieron cagando! Bueno, de allí le hacen todo un estudio dentro de, del sistema médico de la quinta, le meten el anticoagulante, que eso es muy bueno, eso no siguió el daño, ¿entendés? Khalil: Ahora parece que la están llevando, ahora en estos momentos, la están llevando a...en la Favaloro, ¿no? “Alian”: Ya está internada hace una hora y media. (Comunicación del 7/10/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-10-07-141519-20, CD 171). Efectivamente, según la información que se comunicó a la prensa, en el parte oficial rubricado por la Unidad Médica Presidencial y difundido por el Secretario de Comunicación, Alfredo Scoccimarro, la Dra. Fernández había concurrido a la Fundación Favaloro para realizarse un estudio cardiovascular por una arritmia, con un cuadro de cefalea. Scoccimarro dijo que la Sra. Presidente había sufrido un traumatismo de cráneo el 12 de agosto que no había presentado hasta el momento ningún síntoma (“Silencio y misterio alrededor del golpe que sufrió Cristina Fernández”, Perfil, 7/10/2013; “El misterio de un golpe del que no se informó”, La Nación, 07/10/2013). Como puede advertirse, ni de la información oficial, ni de la información obtenida y circulada por los medios periodísticos hasta ese lunes 7 de octubre de 2013, se desprende el grado de detalle que “Alian” tenía sobre la salud de la Sra. Presidente, de las circunstancias en que el cuadro clínico fue detectado, de su sintomatología inicial y del tratamiento médico que recibió Cristina Fernández antes de ser trasladada al sanatorio. Es decir, “Alian” poseía información privilegiada y verídica de la salud de la primera mandataria, que en ese momento no era pública. Y la poseía en detalle, además de actualizada. Es decir, como se dijo y se probó, pertenece al entorno más cercano a la presidente. Esta pertenencia es lógica si se analiza su actuación en el plan criminal. De lo contrario, nunca se le hubiera encargado una tarea en extremo sensible: ejecutar una acción delictiva por directa orden de la Sra. Presidente. En efecto, su accionar abarcó varios aspectos del plan de encubrimiento. En primer lugar actuó como nexo entre las autoridades del gobierno nacional involucradas en el plan de encubrimiento y los canales paralelos de comunicación. En ese sentido, no sorprende que sea “Alian” quien, apenas suscripto el tratado con Irán, se haya comunicado con Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil para pedirle que le transmita a Luis D'Elía un mensaje directo de Cristina Fernández: Que no hable por 10 días. “Alian”: ...lo que le tenes que decir al negro....que esté tranquilo, por diez días no comentes nada. Khalil: Ahora lo llamo (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 1	-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). Inmediatamente, Khalil se comunicó con Luis D’Elía y le pasó el mensaje. Khalil: Escúchame eh...por las dudas que te llamen hoy los medios o alguno, tené perfil bajo, por 10 días por lo menos. D’Elía: Bueno. Khalil: Yo sé por qué te lo digo... D’Elía: Bárbaro....me dijo Parrilli recién también. (Comunicación del 28/01/2013, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-28-135905-20, CD 267) El pedido en sí mismo no es importante. Sí lo es la comprobación de que “Alian” cumple órdenes directamente emanadas de la Presidente. Esto se evidencia por el hecho de pedir exactamente lo mismo que el exSecretario General de la Presidencia, Oscar Parrilli, pero por otros canales. Es decir, la orden fue: Que D’Elía no hable. La transmiten tanto Parrilli como “Alian”. El hecho de comunicar idénticas directivas estratégicas revela una misma fuente que, aquí todo indica, se trata de la Dra. Fernández, lo que no hace más que corroborar la posición de “Alian” en el entorno presidencial. En otra comunicación con Jorge “Yussuf” Khalil, del 6 de febrero de 2013, en relación a la entonces reciente firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, “Alian” dijo: “...estamos muy bien y hay que laburar tranquilos ...tenemos que hacer un trabajo de acá a 10 años, ¿me entendés? Que en un año y medio tengamos las buenas noticias, pero acá hay que hacer un trabajo para mucho tiempo”. Khalil: Seguilo de cerca eso, eh\ “Alian”: Si, pero tranquilo, está cerrado muy arriba, quedate tranca. Khalil: Si, si....seguilo igual...yo sé por qué te lo digo....porque yo escucho del otro lado también, vos escuchas de un lado, yo escucho del otro ” “Alian”: hh bueno, pero acá, una vez que salga la ley,... no podemos, podemos volver Khalil: No, no, seguro, si allá está todo bien, pero lo que pasa....después te cuento cuando nos veamos....porque me mandaron un par de cosas que no me cerraron, entonces después te cuento. (Comunicación del 6/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276). Asimismo, corresponde dejar asentado que la relación entre “Alian” y Khalil se ha ido fortaleciendo. Para congraciarse con la parte iraní, “Alian” le ha ido abriendo puertas de importantes oficinas del gobierno. En ese tren de “favores” a los iraníes, le consiguió a Khalil una reunión con Ricardo Echegaray, titular de la Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos (AFIP) por un tema relacionado a unos seguros de caución. De hecho, cuando Khalil le pidió a “Alian” este contacto, aquel le respondió: “...no hay problema...te venís conmigo...” (Comunicación del 13/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-13-213124- 24, CD 55). También Khalil le ha pedido favores para sus contactos en la Aduana (Comunicación del 24/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-24-175330-20.txt, CD 35). De hecho, en otra oportunidad, “Alian” se comprometió a conseguirle cargos en la Dirección Nacional de Aduanas y en el Ministerio de Interior y Transporte para gente de la 19	En alusión a Timerman 21 En referencia a Nilda Garré, que había sido separada de la conducción del Ministerio de Seguridad. 23	En alusión a Fernando Pocino, Director de Interior de la Secretaria de Inteligencia. 24	Sede de uno de los edificios de la Secretaría de Inteligencia. comunidad chiita, “...tiene que haber cambios en transporte y aduana y ahí van a tratar de meter ...diez tipos en cada lado” (Comunicaciones del 4/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-04-112603-6.txt, CD 76 y del 7/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-07- 152130-22, CD 79). Estos episodios indican que existió una orden, desde lo más alto del poder, que había autorizado determinado accesos, contactos y facilidades a los referentes de Irán en Argentina, dentro del contexto mucho más amplio que significó el plan de impunidad. “Alian” ha sido un actor central en este “abrir puertas” a los contactos locales de los imputados prófugos. Una prueba más de la cercanía entre quienes llevaron adelante la maniobra encubridora. Además, cuando se firmó finalmente el acuerdo, “Alian” le dijo a Khalil: “ ...Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me tenías fe...”, identificándose a sí mismo y a su interlocutor, como integrantes de una misma parte del acuerdo, como partícipes de un mismo interés que, hoy ya se sabe, era más que eso, era un plan delictivo para brindar impunidad (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267). El alineamiento con los acusados iraníes también se trasluce en sus propias palabras, dado que hasta ha llegado a calificarlos de “amigos” (Comunicación del 25/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 02-25-151137-12, CD 295). “Alian”, en incontables oportunidades documentadas, le ha proporcionado a un operador del régimen iraní como Jorge Khalil, que tiene directa y fluida relación con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani, información política del gobierno de Cristina Fernández que no es pública. Esto también revela el enorme grado de confianza que “Alian” ha depositado en Jorge Khalil. En una ocasión, Khalil solicitó que le chequee ciertas cuestiones, por ejemplo, le dijo:	“...tengo	una reunión con una persona...que dice ser amigo y, la verdad, necesito chequear algunas cosas...'’'’ (Comunicación del 22/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-22-121757-24, CD 200). Este tipo de pedidos constituyen nuevas comprobaciones sobre la vinculación entre “Alian” y la inteligencia. Cuando Khalil le pide a “Alian” que le chequee información sobre tal cuestión o persona, es como si el propio Mohsen Rabbani -a quien Khalil responde y con quien habla periódicamente- esté utilizando los servicios de inteligencia del estado para sus necesidades e intereses. Además, este sujeto le relató al agente de Irán, Jorge Khalil, que había estado en Suiza un mes antes de que se suscribiera el acuerdo en Africa, para trabajar en el mismo: “...todo lo que laburamos en esto...vos sabés que yo hace un mes estuve allá en Ginebra...” (Comunicación del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732- 18.wav, CD 267). La intervención de “Alian” luce evidente. Otro aporte fundamental de “Alian” a la ejecución del plan criminal remite a la construcción de la nueva hipótesis delictiva para la causa AMIA que desplace a las acusaciones alzadas por la justicia nacional contra los iraníes. En ese sentido, “Alian” expresó: “...ya estamos en otro país, es otra situación mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto... ”, y este “trabajar en otro contexto” implicaba que la prioridad era un acercamiento geopolítico a Irán, que imponía dejar de lado las acusaciones contra funcionarios de dichos país (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD43). Con ese fin, le comunicó al agente de Irán: “...él sabe lo que va a venir, que va a venir otra hipótesis, con otras pruebas y a hacer culo al norte porque nunca las vio él las pruebas, ¿me entendiste hermano?... ”, está hablando del suscripto (Comunicación del 01/06/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01 -224726-18, CD 43). En pocas palabras, este sujeto, con una posición estratégica dentro del gobierno nacional, le comunicó a un agente que opera para una potencia extranjera, que se van a presentar pruebas falsas para alterar ilegalmente el curso de una causa judicial, deslegitimar a los actuales investigadores y encubrir a los imputados y esa información fue enviada a un acusado y prófugo de la justicia argentina. Cabe destacar la gravedad de las acciones realizadas por “Alian” en este entramado, porque desde su posición en el gobierno nacional proporcionó datos que no son públicos, incluida información de la causa, del suscripto y del acuerdo, a un representante orgánico de Irán - Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil-, quien luego se los comunicó a varias personas, entre ellos, a Mohsen Rabbani, uno de los acusados de terrorismo por la justicia argentina y con notificación roja emitida por Interpol. Al mismo tiempo, la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller, haciendo gala de sus habilidades para tergiversar la realidad proclamaban que el único interés que los movía era destrabar la causa y que solo buscaban verdad y justicia. Vaya paradoja. Por último, podría resultar llamativo que “Alian” no haya considerado necesario actuar en forma encubierta. Ello solo puede deberse a la circunstancia, como ya se demostró, de que estaba actuando por órdenes superiores. Sus contactos de Irán sabían perfectamente a quienes respondía y en qué ámbito se desempeñaba, él mismo ha admitido que la información que ha manejado provenía de donde trabajaba, la Secretaría de Inteligencia, y así ha transmitido información reservada sin necesidad de encubrir su identidad o su actividad, con la tranquilidad propia de quien cumple órdenes y no de quien viola secretos y pone en peligro su fuente de trabajo. Y	además de proveer información secreta y reservada a los contactos locales iraníes, “Alian” ha transmitido tranquilidad en distintos momentos del despliegue encubridor. Así, por ejemplo, cuando se hizo público el nuevo pronunciamiento emitido por esta Unidad Fiscal el 29 de mayo de 2013, en la que se presentaron nuevas pruebas que profundizaban la implicación de los acusados iraníes en el atentado, le dijo a Khalil en referencia a tal dictamen: “ ...Queda ahí...cuando llega al juez para arriba, ¿cómo va a hacer?” (Comunicación del 31/05/2013, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-31-095657-14, CD 42), dejando entrever que estaba todo controlado, que nada iba a pasar con ese dictamen fiscal, porque la decisión última depende de las distintas instancias del Poder Judicial y no de lo que demuestre o sostenga el Ministerio Público Fiscal. De este modo mantenía la tranquilidad y los buenos vínculos con los referentes de Teherán en Buenos Aires, a quienes debía contener y asistir, con el fin último de sostener la “próspera” relación con el régimen iraní y así facilitar el avance del plan criminal. En conclusión, existen fundados elementos para aseverar que los autores de este plan criminal han puesto a una persona allegada al poder de la Secretaría de Inteligencia, de la confianza de la Sra. Presidente, para colaborar con la actividad de los iraníes en paralelo a la implementación de la maniobra de encubrimiento. Y, a través de esta persona -que no es otra que “Alian”- han abierto las puertas de las estructuras del estado para que los representantes locales de Teherán puedan utilizar resortes y contactos, en su favor. Se está en presencia de uno de los sujetos de los que se valieron los encubridores para llevar adelante el plan criminal. Está claro que “Alian” ha sido cuidadosamente seleccionado. Por ser tener acceso al entorno presidencial, por responder a la Secretaría de Inteligencia, por su declarada simpatía con el régimen iraní, por ser un contacto directo y asiduo de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, por su dedicación, obediencia y, sobre todo, por su falta de escrúpulos a la hora de manipular pruebas, personas e inventar hipótesis falsas para lograr la consecución del encubrimiento. d)	Femando Luis Esteche Fernando Esteche es el líder de la agrupación “Quebracho” y desde antaño, ha expresado una clara postura en contra a la acusación a los iraníes por el caso AMIA. A su vez, la cercana vinculación entre miembros del grupo “Quebracho” y funcionarios y ex funcionarios del gobierno de Cristina   Ministerio Público de la Nación Fernández, ha sido expuesta a la opinión pública. De hecho, se calificó a “Quebracho” como un “adherente al oficialismo” (Morales Solá, Joaquín, “Las dos miradas de EEUU”, La Nación, 23/02/2014). Y se dijo que a pesar de la detención de Esteche, esta agrupación había mantenido “...vínculos informales con los K...” (Van Der Kooy, Eduardo, “El activismo de Quebracho ocupa el vacío callejero que dejaron los K”, Clarín, 20/02/2014). En julio de 2011 se conocieron datos que denunciaban que Luis D'Elía y la agrupación Quebracho, entre otras, estaban recibiendo apoyo político y hasta financiero del gobierno iraní (Dinatale, Martín, “Preocupan vínculos con D'Elía y Quebracho”, La Nación, 18/7/11). Para comprender la participación de Femando Esteche en este plan de encubrimiento, se debe tener presente que también se encuentra vinculado al imputado Mohsen Rabbani, al Diputado Andrés Larroque y mantiene fluidos contactos con Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil. En efecto, ha viajado a la República Islámica de Irán a fines de febrero y principios de marzo de 2010, junto a los imputados Luis D’Elía y Jorge Khalil, ocasión en la que participó del 31° aniversario de la Revolución Islámica y oportunidad en la que tuvo contacto personal con Mohsen Rabbani (“D’Elía y Esteche vieron en Irán a un sospechoso de volar la AMIA”, Perfil, 6/3/2010). Por otra parte, su relación con el Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque es un hecho. Esteche mismo lo ha reconocido: “...hoy lo tengo que ver, si, hoy vengo a Capital a verlo a él...”, en alusión al Diputado Larroque (Comunicación del 19/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-19-121034-16, CD 197). Tan es así, que en función del vínculo existente entre Esteche y Larroque, Khalil le ha pedido que lo ayude a construir una relación directa con el diputado (Comunicación del 20/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11 -20-131705- 12, CD 198). Ahora bien, se trata del sujeto que ha viabilizado o hecho posible el avance del plan de encubrimiento mediante, al menos, dos conductas concretas. Primera, posibilitó la vinculación del agente iraní en Buenos Aires, Jorge Khalil, con funcionarios del gobierno argentino. Específicamente lo ha contactado con los operadores de la Secretaria de Inteligencia, el sujeto apodado “Alian” y el Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia, quienes han participado, entre otras cuestiones, del armado de la falsa hipótesis que debía desplazar a la que involucra a los iraníes encubiertos. En efecto, Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil reconoció expresamente que se ha sentado a la mesa con los funcionarios de la Secretaría de Inteligencia para trabajar en el avance del plan encubridor gracias a la gestión de Esteche (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2012-11 -04-130024-6, CD 182). Segunda. Esteche, personalmente, ha contribuido con ideas específicas para la construcción de la nueva y falsa hipótesis del gobierno de Cristina Fernández para el atentado del 18 de julio de 1994. Véase lo que expresaba en diciembre de 2012 acerca de los pasos que se debían tomar en relación al encubrimiento: “...el nuevo responsable de AMIA, por ejemplo, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla, van a querer ir construyendo el consenso de esto...no van a poder decir que fueron los israelíes... ”, sugiriendo que podían atribuirle el hecho a “...una conexión de fachos locales...” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Y aportando una idea concreta, agregó: “...El Fiscal de AMIA es de ellos, Yrimia, que lo echaron del caso AMIA, él te puede...generar información, quiero que me den información del caso AMIA, ¿se puede o no se puede? ¿Qué están dispuestos a aportar?..?'’ (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Ha sido precisamente Esteche quien contactó al Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia y lo conectó con el referente local de Irán en el país, Jorge Khalil, para que le brinde información de la causa judicial a los fines de contribuir a fabricar, con cierto grado de credibilidad en virtud de los datos aportados, una nueva hipótesis sobre el atentado, con otros imputados. En efecto, en una conversación Khalil comentó que estuvo reunido por dos horas con “el ex juez y ex fiscal de la causa AMIA, Yrimia” y que el contacto venía de parte de conocidos de Esteche (Comunicación del 19/1/14, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo IN-12177-20140119-003044, CD 49). Recuérdese que, al momento del atentado, Yrimia era Fiscal de Primera Instancia en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal a cargo de la Fiscalía N°6 y fue designado el mismo día del hecho para colaborar con la investigación, en carácter conjunto, alterno o sucesivo respecto de otros fiscales también nombrados a esos efectos, lo que le franqueó el acceso al expediente en sus primeros tiempos. Este es un aporte central del Sr. Esteche al desenvolvimiento del plan aquí ejecutado y tuvo lugar meses antes de la firma del acuerdo con Irán, lo que demuestra -también- la planificación y el conocimiento con el que actuaban estos sujetos cuando aún nadie, ni los propios familiares sabían, siquiera, que se iba a firmar un acuerdo y, mucho menos, podían conocer su contenido. Era lógico: en el trazado criminal, la maniobra que se pergeñaba los perjudicaba directamente. Además, existen otros elementos que convalidan la vinculación de Esteche con los iraníes al comprobarse que ha recibido recursos económicos procedentes de Irán. Khalil comentó al respecto: “...« Fernando, la gente que trabaja con Heshmat ...le está bajando recursos ...todos los meses ...fijo todos los meses ...por empleado... ” (Comunicación del 30/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	11-30-163313-28, CD 208). Esta red de vinculación lo convirtió en otro eje importante de los ductos de negociación y comunicación, que motorizaron y viabilizaron el plan de encubrimiento en curso. e)	Héctor Luis Yrimia Otra de las personas que tuvo una participación relevante, colaboró y suministró información a los agentes iraníes en Argentina, que aportó para la construcción de la nueva hipótesis falsa e hizo avanzar el plan encubridor, fue el ex Juez Nacional en lo Criminal de Instrucción y ex Fiscal Federal, Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia. El primer registro contabilizado del contacto entre Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil y Héctor Yrimia data de principios de noviembre de 2012: “Tuve una charla con el Fiscal...El Fiscal de la causa....el que estaba, no el que está ahora, el que estaba...'’'1 (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-04-130024-6, CD 182). Esto ya ocurría poco más de un mes después que se anunciara públicamente la negociación con Irán y antes de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento. Presente el desarrollo de los acontecimientos posteriores, es de toda lógica que para esa época ya se estuviera trabajando en la construcción de la pista alternativa, de la falsa hipótesis que desplazaría la imputación a los acusados iraníes. Yrimia se sumó al plan e inició sus fluidos contactos con los referentes locales de Teherán gracias a la intermediación de Fernando Esteche. Y así lo explicó Khalil: “...Y, el que me sienta es Fernando”. (Comunicación del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012- 11-04-130024-6, CD 182), quien lo sugiere como fuente de información “eso te puede servir bien concreto para cualquiera de las tesis ...cualquiera de las cosas que vayan a resolverse va a servir porque es información” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2012-	12-18-183332-8,	CD 226). Y existen importantes elementos que lo vinculan con la Secretaría de Inteligencia: “el fiscal de AMIA es de ellos, Yrimia” (Comunicación del 18/12/2012, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Estas referencias indican que el Dr. Yrimia respondería al mismo sector de la Secretaría de Inteligencia que “Alian”, quien sostiene:	“ ...Yrimia. ..es empleado mío ese...” (Comunicación del 7/10/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-	10-07-141519-20,	CD 171). Los contactos de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil con el Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia continuaron mes tras mes y se fueron profundizando. En enero de 2014, Khalil le comentó a Abdul Karim Paz: “...Hoy hablé con el ex juez y ex fiscal de la causa AMIA, Yrimia...tuve una reunión dos horas...” (Comunicación del 19/1/14, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo IN-12177- 20140119-003044, CD 49). De hecho, para la misma época se registraron conversaciones entre Khalil y Héctor Luis Yrimia, que dan cuenta de su participación en el plan delictivo (Comunicaciones del 20/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-20-205332-26 CD 276 y Comunicación del 24/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01 -24-153750- 18, CD 280). Ya en febrero de 2014 se registraron comunicaciones en las que el abogado se ha identificado, sin dejar lugar a ninguna hesitación: ''""'...Buen día, Jorge. Luis Yrimia...”, a lo cual Khalil respondió: “¿Cómo le va, doctor querido?’’'’ (Comunicación del 11/02/2014, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-11-114448-6, CD 298). El importante grado de confianza que revelan los contactos entre Khalil e Yrimia no solo se condice con los serios asuntos que los unen sino que dan cuenta del avance en sus tareas. Hay evidencias que confirman que Jorge Khalil reunió, en más de una oportunidad, al Dr. Yrimia con el Encargado de Negocios de Irán en Argentina, circunstancia de la cual solo estaba al tanto el agente de inteligencia “Alian” (Comunicaciones del 23/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-23-212332- 26, CD 279; Comunicación del 24/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-24-153750-18, CD 280; Comunicación del 11/02/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2014-02-11-114448- 6, CD 298). Además, existen datos que demuestran que los temas entre ambos se fueron diversificando y abordaron la posibilidad de producir acercamientos religiosos (Comunicación del 19/01/2014, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-l009-2014-01-19-002737-2, CD 275). Así lo reconoció el mismo Khalil al comentar: “...me junto con el número uno de los que operan políticamente para el Vaticano...son los que están acomodando toda la historia...”, en alusión a la fabricación de la pista falta que redireccione la investigación de la causa “AMIA” hacia otra hipótesis y nuevos imputados. Y agregó: “...nosotros estamos hablando de trabajar, de hacer un trabajo conjunto entre la iglesia y el chiismo...esas son las excusas. Ahora, después, estos tipos operaron mucho el tema... uno fue... ex juez de la causa AMIA...Yrimia...Yrimia...con ese me junto hoy...” (Comunicación del 22/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2014-	01-22-102353-16, CD 278). La reunión por cuestiones religiosas, completamente ajena al objeto de la denuncia, constituye una excusa, como lo reconoce Khalil, toda vez que la vinculación con Yrimia giró siempre en tomo al encubrimiento de los acusados por AMIA. De hecho, al hablar de “Alian”, tanto Khalil como Yrimia se refieren al “amigo en común”, con quien deben juntarse por “el otro tema”, es decir, la cuestión “aparte del trabajo religioso”, en clara alusión a la causa AMIA y la elaboración de la hipótesis que sirva para despistar la investigación y desarticular la acusación contra los iraníes (Comunicación del 03/02/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-03- 144547-22, CD 290). No puede soslayarse una referencia al enmascaramiento con que estos personajes han cubierto sus actividades delictivas. Mientras se reunían por cuestiones lícitas y legítimas, como ser el acercamiento entre dos religiones, han motorizado, al mismo tiempo y en las mismas reuniones, el plan criminal encabezado por la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller. Esta forma de actuar es, lamentablemente, conocida para esta Unidad Fiscal pues se trata nada menos que del modo dual que los agentes iraníes han utilizado para ocultar actividades subrepticias y hasta delictivas. Ocultan sus fines criminales detrás de fachadas religiosas o culturales. Así, es realmente preocupante ver replicado ese accionar en este nuevo encubrimiento o, al menos, en una parte de él. Concluyendo, lo cierto es que el plan para generar la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iraníes sigue vigente. Sus partícipes   Ministerio Público de la Nación continúan trabajando, tal como ha podido comprobarse en los recientes párrafos. La contribución del Dr. Yrimia al plan criminal ha sido sustancial. Ha puesto al servicio de la maniobra de encubrimiento su conocimiento sobre la causa AMIA. Se trata de un conocimiento específico pues lo ha obtenido en el ejercicio de su anterior cargo como Fiscal Federal especialmente designado por la Procuración General de la Nación para intervenir en la investigación del atentado perpetrado contra la sede de la AMIA (Resolución N°37/94 del 18/07/1994), por instrucción expresa del Ministerio de Justicia (Resolución N°83 de la misma fecha). En esa condición ha conocido los hechos en detalle, ha visto las pruebas, las testimoniales, los peritajes, los informes técnicos, el resultado de los allanamientos, ha escuchado las versiones de los primeros imputados. Este minucioso grado de cognición lo ha vuelto fundamental para el buen desarrollo del plan. Y	justamente su aporte se ha realizado donde resulta más útil: en el armado de la hipótesis falsa. Estuvo y está en condiciones de indicar con certeza si tal o cual teoría resulta verosímil o no, si encaja con las probanzas con que cuenta el expediente, si debe modificarse algún punto, etc. Es decir que, valiéndose de la información obtenida en ocasión de ejercer la función pública, se ha abocado a esta participación criminal. Además, tampoco puede soslayarse que se ha desempeñado varios años como Juez de la Nación. De allí que también posea los conocimientos técnicos necesarios para viabilizar la falsa hipótesis. Es evidente, entonces, que su aporte ha resultado extremadamente valioso en el plan delictivo aquí denunciado. d)	Andrés Larrogue Ha quedado demostrado que tanto Luis D’Elía como Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil son personas que han sido cuidadosamente seleccionadas para oficiar de nexos clandestinos en el plan de encubrimiento. Una de las cualidades que comparten es que, pese a la profunda consustanciación con los gobiernos a los que representan y la confianza que inspiran en sus mandantes, no son figuras oficiales. No ejercen cargos públicos ni tienen responsabilidades políticas visibles en los gobiernos a los que sirven. Pero como denominador común, operan muy cerca del poder, son de confianza del poder y, valga la redundancia, poseen -en sus respectivos ámbitos- mucho poder. Para intermediar entre los autores del plan delictivo y varios de sus ejecutores, se recurrió a una persona que pudiera dar cuenta, fácilmente, de sus contactos tanto con unos como con otros: el Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, quien ha oficiado de nexo entre la Presidenta de la Nación, Dra. Cristina Fernández y Luis D’Elía, a los efectos de avanzar con el delito aquí denunciado. Esta afirmación no es una simple conjetura, ni siquiera se trata de una inferencia o una deducción. Aquí se reproduce prueba directa que lo demuestra. Khalil ha admitido sin ambages haber recibido mensajes directamente de parte de Larroque: “...yo estuve hablando con D'Elíay con el ‘Cuervo ’ Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmití al Safír  y el Safir me dijo lo mismo...no hagamos algo que pueda molestar’''' (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18- 095153-16, CD 196). Respecto al mismo encuentro aclaró: “...recién he tenido una reunión con Luis D’Elía y el ‘Cuervo’ Larroque, el de La Cámpora...que querían hablar conmigo, que tenían un mensaje del gobierno para dar...y ahora me voy para Martínez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador’’’ (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-1 l-17-104846-10.wav, CD 195). La interacción es evidente. Larroque ha transmitido mensajes emanados de las autoridades del gobierno nacional involucradas en el encubrimiento y Khalil los ha hecho llegar a la contraparte iraní. Se trataron de mensajes relativos al plan criminal comunicados a través de canales paralelos. La intermediación de Larroque entre Cristina Fernández y D’Elía quedó evidenciada ante la opinión pública en general cuando se publicó que el Diputado le había transmitido a D'Elía el siguiente mensaje: “Dice Cristina que no hables más hasta las elecciones” (“Cristina furiosa con D'Elía: No hables más hasta las elecciones”, La Política On Line, 26/9/2013). Esta información periodística se condice en un todo con los datos que surgen de las conversaciones telefónicas aquí transcriptas y/o referenciadas, en tanto que a través suyo ha entrado y salido la información al despacho presidencial, al menos, en varios episodios relacionados con los hechos aquí denunciados. Este rol de intermediario también fue necesario en las cuestiones comerciales que han estado subyacentes al encubrimiento. Así, Khalil dio cuenta de haber transmitido mensajes sobre temas comerciales con Irán: “...yo fui a hablar con D'Elía y le dije...todas las propuestas y de la cancillería, de la cancillería también...lo que me había propuesto... Y él lo elevó al “Cuervo” Larroque...el de “La Cámpora"", el Jefe de “La Cámpora”...Y ya iban a hablar con Cristina...” (Comunicación del 14/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-14-131007- 12.wav, CD 0025). Cuando aún no se había firmado el acuerdo, Larroque ya intermediaba para evitar complicaciones que pudieran dañar el acercamiento con Teherán. Así, en noviembre de 2012, junto con Luis D'Elía, le solicitó a Khalil que no sumara a los grupos que lidera de la comunidad iraní local a una marcha organizada por partidos de izquierda en defensa de la “causa palestina” y, también, que cesara con los reproches y reclamos, porque ese tipo de acciones podían repercutir en las florecientes relaciones bilaterales. Al respecto, contó Khalil: “...Hoy a la mañana tuve una reunión con la gente del gobierno, me pidieron que por favor no vaya a la reunión... ” y le dijeron: “...Pará la bronca, porque el tema de...puede repercutir en las relaciones que están manteniendo, las conversaciones que estamos teniendo nosotros en Ginebra... ”, en clara alusión a las rondas diplomáticas que gestaron el pacto con Irán. Y agregó: “...Entonces no quiero que ninguno de nosotros, que representa a la República Islámica de una u otra manera... o de la comunidad nuestra...no tiene que ir a ninguno de esos...Ya lo hablé con Larroque y con D'Elía... ” (Comunicación del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2012-11-17-183444- 8, CD 195). Al día siguiente, relató: “...nosotros no estamos haciendo ninguna manifestación acá, porque estamos en plenas negociaciones con el gobierno... a esa reunión la convoqué y o... pero después la tiré para atrás ...porque en base a las negociaciones que se están haciendo entre Irán y Argentina, no queremos vernos inmiscuidos nosotros. Aparte fue un pedido del gobierno. Yo estuve hablando con D'Elía y con el Cuervo Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmití al Safir...y el Safir me dijo lo mismo... 'no hagamos algo que, que pueda molestar” (Comunicación del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18-095153- 16, CD 196). Y le confesó a Esteche: “...el sábado fui a la casa del gordo, hablé con el gordo y el gordo adelante mío lo llamó al cuervo, puso el altavoz...Cuervo, estoy con Yussefbla bla bla...le estoy diciendo que lo que me dijiste que transmita. Así, eh?...”, refiriéndose, respectivamente, a Luis D'Elía y Andrés Larroque (Comunicación del 19/11/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-19-121034-16, CD 197). Toda esta secuencia expone la intervención del Diputado Larroque para, conforme lo necesitaba el plan encubridor de la Dra. Fernández, proteger las negociaciones con Teherán de cualquier tensión innecesaria. Ello, sin perjuicio de otros aportes directos ya mencionados, tendientes al objetivo criminal aquí denunciado. Además, como ya se refirió en acápites previos, Larroque también ha estado en contacto con Fernando Esteche, quien reconoció: “...hoy lo tengo que ver, si, hoy vengo a Capital a verlo a él..”, en alusión al legislador (Comunicación del 19/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2012-11-19-121034-16, CD 197). Tan es así, que en función del vínculo existente entre Esteche y Larroque, Khalil le pidió que lo ayude a construir una relación directa con el diputado (Comunicación del 20/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-20-131705- 12, CD 198). En suma, el Diputado Larroque ha operado, en el marco de este plan, como nexo entre la Sra. Presidente y Luis D'Elía, le ha llevado mensajes e indicaciones al referente de Teherán, Jorge Khalil, y se ha mantenido en comunicaciones con Fernando Esteche en relación al plan encubridor. Un actor clave en la articulación de las comunicaciones y negociaciones que viabilizaron la maniobra denunciada. VII.	- Conclusiones: Durante el desarrollo de la presente denuncia se han explicado en detalle los hechos y se han expuesto múltiples elementos de prueba que demuestran que la Sra. Presidente de la Nación Argentina, Dra. Cristina Elisabet Fernández, emitió una expresa directiva para que se diseñara y ejecutara un plan tendiente a desvincular a los acusados de nacionalidad iraní de la causa por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, a efectos de brindarles impunidad definitiva. Se ha acreditado también que dicha directiva estuvo motivada en la decisión de la primera mandataria de producir un acercamiento de carácter geopolítico como así también de restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal con la República Islámica de Irán, al entender que ello paliaría sustancialmente la crisis energética nacional. Así, los elementos de prueba demostraron que el plan ideado por la Sra. Presidente fue instrumentado principalmente por su canciller, Sr. Héctor Timerman. Que insumió dos años de negociaciones tanto secretas como públicas con autoridades de la República Islámica de Irán, en las cuales las autoridades argentinas dejaron de lado el reclamo de justicia por el caso AMIA y acordaron dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol como un primer paso para desvincular definitivamente de la investigación judicial a todos los acusados iraníes. Uno de los medios elegidos, quizás el más visible pero no el único, para cumplir con ese objetivo convenido de antemano fue el “Memorando de Entendimiento” presentado como el resultado de las negociaciones entre las partes, cuando en realidad, según la prueba obtenida, se trató del instrumento que permite viabilizar la destrucción de las imputaciones contra los acusados iraníes. Se acreditó que dicho Memorando de Entendimiento ha cumplido un papel central en la maniobra de encubrimiento. Fue la vía que esgrimieron los socios del plan criminal para instar la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Además, el documento estaba destinado a garantizar la impunidad de los prófugos iraníes mediante la actuación de la “Comisión de la Verdad”, cuyas conclusiones -como se vio- ya estaban pactadas de antemano. Esta Comisión daría lugar a la nueva hipótesis falsa que, basada en pruebas inventadas, había sido fabricada para reemplazar las acusaciones sostenidas por la pesquisa judicial. Quedó demostrado además que los autores de esta confabulación criminal -Cristina Fernández y Héctor Timerman- fueron secundados por un grupo de partícipes, especialmente elegidos por sus antecedentes y su consustanciación con el plan criminal aquí denunciado. / Quedó clara la participación de Luis Angel D’Elía, Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, Fernando Esteche, del Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, del ex Fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA, Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia y del agente de inteligencia conocido como “Alian”, que las pruebas indican que su verdadero nombre sería Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. Se expusieron, asimismo, los elementos de prueba que acreditaron que tanto la Sra. Presidente de la Nación como el Sr. Canciller efectuaron aportes personales al perfeccionamiento de la maniobra delictiva. AUS& De las contribuciones concretas y específicas de la Sra. Presidente, surgió con claridad que no solamente fue quien decidió la articulación de este plan criminal de impunidad y que se valió de distintos actores para llevar adelante su ejecución, sino que en todo momento estuvo en control de la maniobra, ya sea impartiendo órdenes directas a sus cómplices, o bien encabezando la necesaria campaña discursiva para camuflar la perpetración del delito. Así, ha elegido a algunos de los partícipes del encubrimiento, involucrando directamente a -cuanto menos- uno de sus ministros y a un legislador nacional; ha controlado la evolución del plan en cada paso; ha negociado por interpósitas personas con uno de los prófugos; y se ha involucrado personalmente en algunas acciones de ocultamiento que este sofisticado plan requería. En el caso del Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Nación, se demostró holgadamente que Héctor Timerman ha sido -sin duda alguna- el principal instrumentador del plan de impunidad ideado y ordenado por la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fernández. Desde su función, transmitió a Irán la decisión del gobierno argentino de abandonar el reclamo de justicia en la causa AMIA; acordó la baja de las notificaciones rojas; signó acuerdos secretos con la parte iraní; participó de las negociaciones, de la redacción y de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, pieza central del plan de impunidad. Y se involucró personalmente en la campaña de descrédito y engaño, destinada a destruir la credibilidad de la causa judicial con el fin de, dolosamente, presentar al acuerdo con Irán como la única vía apta para solucionar el caso. Ambos funcionarios actuaron con un único propósito: lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados y el cese de toda actividad jurisdiccional en su contra, para lograr su objetivo último de comerciar libremente a nivel estatal con Irán y acercarse geopolíticamente a Teherán, sin soportar reproche alguno por parte de la opinión pública argentina y mundial. Ello, según surge de la evidencia reunida y sin descartar en modo alguno la existencia de otros motivos adicionales a los aquí expuestos, pero que en nada modifican o disminuyen la criminal responsabilidad de los denunciados. En el cumplimiento de este entramado delictivo han sucedido situaciones realmente alarmantes. Mientras la justicia dedicó y dedica ingentes esfuerzos a lograr la detención y posterior enjuiciamiento de quienes ha señalado “prima facie” como responsables de haber participado en el atentado del 18 de julio de 1994, el Poder Ejecutivo Nacional ha negociado en secreto, justamente con uno de esos imputados, Mohsen Rabbani, la compra y venta de petróleo por granos y, fundamentalmente, su impunidad. Estas acciones han motivado, con justa razón, que se advierta sobre la inaudita gravedad institucional de la maniobra que se denuncia, pues a través del plan criminal no solo se intenta destruir la investigación judicial del mayor atentado terrorista que ha sufrido nuestro país, sino que en la ideación, planificación e instrumentación del delito han participado algunas de las más altas autoridades del gobierno nacional, incluyendo la cabeza del Poder Ejecutivo. En razón de la inusual extensión de la presente denuncia, resulta conveniente reseñar brevemente los puntos más relevantes que han sido probados en esta presentación y que se han tenido en cuenta para formar la convicción acerca de la comisión de un concurso de delitos de acción pública. A saber: •	Que la decisión de la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fernández, de brindarle impunidad a los acusados iraníes y desvincularlos de la investigación por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, estuvo motivada -al menos- en razones de índole geopolítica y comercial. La primera mandataria entendió que el petróleo iraní tendría la capacidad de aliviar la severa crisis energética que viene atravesando el país. Intercambios, a modo de ejemplo, de “granos por petróleo” (sic) fueron vistos como una solución a la situación de emergencia,  'LBERTO FISCAL GENERAL  más allá del interés en acercarse a Teherán, como parte de un nuevo posicionamiento geopolítico en el actual escenario mundial. •	Que estos intereses geopolíticos y comerciales fueron reconocidos por los propios partícipes: “...estamos en otro país, es otra situación mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...” y “...el tema que necesita Argentina, es petróleo...hay un verdadero interés para empezar y entablar las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno, con funcionarios del gobierno de acá, una delegación de allá viajaría o a Caracas o al Golfo o a Beirut mejor ...para empezar las relaciones directas de funcionarios a funcionarios... ”. •	Que la resolución presidencial que pretende alinearse y/o comerciar a nivel estatal con la República Islámica de Irán no es cuestionable judicialmente por tratarse de funciones propias del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional, en tanto conductor de las relaciones exteriores del país. •	Que la opción elegida por la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller para habilitar el mencionado acercamiento geopolítico y la vía comercial fue lo que motivó esta denuncia, por la sencilla y única razón de que optaron por un camino ilegal y delictivo e incurrieron en conductas tipificadas en nuestro Código Penal, al ordenar la diagramación y ejecución de un plan destinado a desvincular definitivamente a los acusados iraníes del caso AMIA. •	Contrario a esta decisión y acciones delictivas, durante la presidencia de Néstor Kirchner se rechazaron rotundamente todos los ofrecimientos de Teherán, siempre destinados a acordar una salida políticamente negociada a esta cuestión, netamente judicial. De ello dieron cuenta varios testimonios coincidentes -del ex Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fernández; de los ex Cancilleres, Rafael Bielsa y Jorge Taiana y del ex Vice Canciller, Roberto García Moritán- que describen los pactos propuestos por Irán y su rechazo por parte del el ex presidente argentino. •	Que el plan pergeñado por Cristina Fernández incluyó el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol -inesperadamente frustrado por el firme accionar del Secretario General Ronald K. Noble-, la firma de un documento jurídico bilateral con capacidad para viabilizar la impunidad de los acusados iraníes, el redireccionamiento fraudulento de la investigación judicial hacia una nueva pista falsa con pruebas inventadas, el desenvolvimiento de una campaña mediática y discursiva para horadar la credibilidad de las conclusiones de la justicia nacional y la manipulación de los familiares de las víctimas, de los sobrevivientes del atentado y de las instituciones comunitarias judías damnificadas por el ataque terrorista de 1994. •	Que dicho plan de impunidad principió en el mes de enero de 2011, en la ciudad siria de Alepo, ocasión en la que el Canciller Timerman le comunicó a su par iraní Ali Akbar Salehi que “Argentina ya no está más interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados...en cambio prefiere mejorar las relaciones económicas con Irán...”. Es la primera vez que un estado agredido implora a un estado agresor que firme un acuerdo por el cual les otorgará impunidad a los agresores. •	Que las tratativas con los representantes de la República Islámica de Irán se mantuvieron en secreto hasta el mes de septiembre de 2012, cuando la Sra. Presidente anunció públicamente el “inicio” de un proceso de negociación con Irán. •	Que una vez oficializadas las reuniones y valiéndose del secreto propio de la actividad diplomática formal, se mantuvo oculto el contenido de las conversaciones, como una necesidad lógica de los •	involucrados de tapar las maniobras delictivas que estaban llevando adelante. •	Que con fecha 27 de enero de 2013 se firmó en el Reino de Etiopía, el Memorando de Entendimiento, lo que vino a confirmar que las negociaciones no habían procurado generar una herramienta para facilitar la cooperación judicial con la causa AMIA y/o la extradición de los imputados, sino que se había redactado un instrumento jurídico, con apariencia de legalidad que viabilizara, a la par de ocultar, la decisión acordada de antemano: la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iraníes. •	Luego de suscribirse el acuerdo, el agente de inteligencia argentino “Alian” le confesó a su par de Irán: “...Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me tenías fe...”, dejando en evidencia que ambas partes han tenido el mismo objetivo criminal. De allí que se compruebe que no se trata, como se presentó públicamente, de dos partes que negocian un acuerdo bilateral, sino de dos socios que participan de un sofisticado plan criminal de impunidad para desligar definitivamente a los prófugos de la causa AMIA de toda relación con el atentado y cerrar toda investigación respecto de ellos. •	Que la ambigüedad, vaguedad y omisión del texto del Memorando de Entendimiento han sido ingredientes relevantes de la ingeniería encubridora aquí denunciada, dado que han dotado al plan criminal de la necesaria flexibilidad jurídica y semántica para que los autores de este encubrimiento puedan adaptar la implementación de sus disposiciones a la aleatoriedad de factores externos y ajenos que eventualmente surjan durante la consecución del plan. Que la intrincada redacción del memorando confirmó la existencia de un trabajo minucioso y pensado al detalle para viabilizar la impunidad. Así quedó establecido el dolo directo con que actuaron los protagonistas del plan que, con pleno conocimiento de la finalidad de sus acciones, buscaron desvincular a los iraníes de las imputaciones por el atentado. •	Que para ello, el Canciller Héctor Timerman se comprometió a dar de baja las notificaciones rojas que pesaban y pesan sobre cinco acusados iraníes. Por tal razón se redactó el punto 7o del Memorando de Entendimiento, único con carácter operativo. La sola firma del pacto habilitó la comunicación a Interpol, con el propósito de que procediera a la inmediata baja de las notificaciones rojas, como fue admitido sin ambages por la diplomacia iraní. •	Que la Organización Internacional de Policía Criminal (Interpol) intervino oportunamente en el caso, garantizando la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas, frustrando, al menos hasta el momento, la promesa asumida por el Sr. Timerman. •	Que tal situación no solo provocó la queja pública del Canciller Iraní, que demandó: “...según el acuerdo firmado por ambos países, la Interpol (Policía Internacional) debe eliminar las acusaciones contra las autoridades iraníes..."", sino que ello también quedó registrado en los canales paralelos de comunicación con Teherán:	.Timerman	no cumplió con algunas cosas. Esto es así de claro. No cumplió con algunas cosas..."". Esto motivó, en Irán, el retiro del acuerdo del trámite parlamentario de aprobación que se había iniciado y hasta la fecha, no se ha notificado oficialmente la ratificación ni ha tenido lugar el intercambio de notas reversales.   •	Que el Canciller Timerman no sólo suscribió el Memorando de Entendimiento, sino que cerró, al menos, dos compromisos secretos e ilegales. Así fue explicado por Khalil, al día siguiente de su regreso de Teherán: “...me parece que el ruso este de mierda [en alusión a Héctor Timerman] se mandó alguna....estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares [en referencia a las notificaciones rojas de Interpol]...” y ratificado, en marzo de 2013, por el entonces Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores iraní, Alí Akbar Salehi: “...El [contenido] del acuerdo entre Irán y Argentina en relación con la cuestión AMIA será hecho público en el momento adecuado...”. No hablaba del Memorando de Entendimiento, sino de otro acuerdo que dos meses después de firmado y publicitado el memorando, aún permanecía en secreto. Y en este marco deben entenderse también otras manifestaciones de Jorge “Yussuf’ Khalil, cuando comentando noticias periodísticas que difundían que el ex Ministro de Defensa iraní, Ahmad Vahidi, nunca sería interrogado pese a estar incluido en el Memorando, aseguró que ese tema en particular “estaba conversado antes ....estaba dentro del marco” y que el acuerdo “es más profundo todavía”. •	Que el Memorando de Entendimiento prevé otros mecanismos para lograr la impunidad de los acusados. La “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en el acuerdo ha sido creada para desacreditar la investigación llevada a cabo por la justicia argentina y legitimar una nueva y falsa versión de los hechos, fabricada para redireccionar la pesquisa hacia otros imputados, con el objeto de desvincular a los iraníes. Así lo han reconocido los encubridores: “...alguien va a salir con la cara manchada de acá...eso ya está arreglado... ¿Cómo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo? Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa...”. •	Que la impunidad se acordó en forma previa a la firma del Memorando e incluyó la elaboración de una hipótesis alternativa con pruebas falsas para desviar en forma fraudulenta la investigación judicial a terceros, desincriminando a los iraníes. En referencia a ello, en una fecha tan temprana como diciembre de 2012, Esteche aseveró: “...quieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla... ”. Y de la conversación se desprende que esa tarea quedó a cargo de funcionarios de la Secretaría de Inteligencia, especialmente designados para esta tarea. Al respecto, también se dijo: “...va a venir otra hipótesis, con otras pruebas...” y se especulaba que el suscripto, Fiscal de la causa por el atentado a la AMIA quedara “...culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, él, las pruebas, lo que viene ahora...”. •	Que los pasos y avances locales del plan fueron comunicados en tiempo real tanto a las autoridades iraníes en Teherán como a uno de los prófugos de la causa AMIA, Mohsen Rabbani, quien aún ostenta un enorme poder decisorio dentro del régimen iraní y ha sido informado permanentemente de la marcha de su propio encubrimiento. •	Que la circunstancia de que las autoridades iraníes hayan estado al tanto de lo que resolvía y decidía el gobierno argentino, volvió a demostrar que el acuerdo, lejos de haber contribuido con la causa, como falsamente se proclamó, fue un disfraz jurídico de un acuerdo ilegal previo y mucho más amplio. •	Que la influencia del imputado Rabbani ha desembocado en un hecho penoso. La negociación activa de los funcionarios nacionales aquí acusados con uno de los prófugos a los que estaban, en simultáneo, encubriendo. Es decir, mientras la justicia dedicaba esfuerzos para lograr la detención y posterior enjuiciamiento de aquellas personas señaladas como responsables por el atentado, la Dra. Cristina Fernández y su Canciller, a través de interpósitas personas negociaban con unos de los principales acusados, Mohsen Rabbani, la compra de petróleo y su impunidad. Según dijo el nombrado: “...aquí hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que estas listos para vender petróleo a la Argentina...y también comprar armas...’’'’ •	Que de forma paralela y para facilitar el avance del encubrimiento la Dra. Cristina Fernández y el Sr. Héctor Timerman desplegaron verdaderas campañas de desprestigio, engaño y manipulación mediante la articulación de una artillería de mentiras, falacias, puestas en escena y secretos con el fin de ocultar las intenciones criminales y facilitar la ejecución del plan de impunidad. •	Que ambos funcionarios mintieron al negar que el acercamiento con Teherán estuviera motivado en razones comerciales o geopolíticas. Mintieron también cuando aseguraron que el Memorando de Entendimiento solo buscaba verdad y justicia. Cuando dijeron que la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas no estaba en peligro. Cuando expresaron que la causa estaba paralizada. Cuando aseveraron que se firmaría un anexo al pacto y luego lo negaron. Cuando aseguraron que no iban a permitir que el caso AMIA se transformara en una pieza de ajedrez en la geopolítica mundial. Cuando dijeron que no existían acuerdos o cláusulas secretas, entre muchas otras falsedades que fueron señaladas a lo largo de esta denuncia. •	Quizás la más dolorosa de las mentiras tuvo como protagonista a la Sra. Presidente, quién públicamente le aseguró a los sobrevivientes del atentado y a los familiares de las víctimas, que los consultaría frente a cualquier propuesta que realizara Teherán, previo a tomar alguna decisión. No sólo jamás hubo consulta alguna sino que los familiares debieron enterarse de la firma del pacto bilateral por los medios de comunicación. En cambio, el Sr. D'Elía, activamente involucrado en el plan criminal, fue informado de inmediato y de manera personal por el entonces Secretario General de Presidencia de la Nación, Oscar Parrilli. •	Que las actuaciones de la Sra. Presidente y del Sr. Canciller incluyeron también una puesta en escena verificada los días 27 y 28 de septiembre de 2013, ocasión en la que públicamente se informó sobre una reunión entre los cancilleres argentino e iraní, mientras que subrepticiamente autores y partícipes del plan coordinaban en secreto las declaraciones y acciones posteriores, para engañar a la opinión pública y permitir que el plan criminal siguiera su marcha. El operador y partícipe de este plan Luis D’Elía especificó el pedido: “. ..tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar allá urgente [en referencia a Irán], antes de mañana...Estoy en la casa de gobierno ahora... no hay asunto más importante que este, créemelo ....necesito que hables con el Sheik de allá [en referencia a Rabbani] mira que es muy groso lo que tengo eh!...”. La Sra. Presidente buscaba obtener ciertos pronunciamientos por parte de Teherán, funcionales al plan de impunidad. •	Que la realidad, como se acreditó a lo largo de la presentación, demostró ser diametralmente opuesta a lo declamado públicamente por la Dra. Fernández y el Sr. Timerman. Su engaño fue premeditado y sus aportes han sido centrales en el plan delictivo. Tan es así que los cómplices del plan han asegurado que todo estaba “cerrado muy arriba”, todo había sido decidido “al más alto nivel” porque “lo pidió la jefa” y su canciller, obediente, implemento el plan porque fue “orden, orden y orden"". La evidencia reunida así lo demuestra. •	Que también en forma paralela y para facilitar el plan de impunidad, se establecieron mecanismos de apoyo y protección a los referentes de Irán en Argentina, producto de lo que se había acordado. Éstos, conscientes de ello, afirmaron “el gobierno ahora está a favor “...el gobierno banca...'1'' y “...Nosotros estamos ante un acuerdo con el gobierno nacional ...atrás de una negociación con el gobierno nacional...”. •	Que este plan de encubrimiento e impunidad contó con la colaboración indispensable de un grupo de individuos cuyas funciones y aportes viabilizaron el éxito del plan. •	Que Luis D’Elía, acérrimo defensor del régimen iraní y “soldado” incondicional de la Presidente -como él se ha definido- fue el sujeto elegido para la transmisión y recepción de mensajes clandestinos a Irán. En sus palabras: “...Yo tengo que hacer el juego de la Rosada...Si tengo orden de no ir, soy un soldado acá...”. D’Elía fue, en este plan, el interlocutor oculto y válido de las autoridades gubernamentales argentinas para resolver los obstáculos que iba presentando el “iter criminis”. Consustanciado ideológicamente con ambas partes del pacto delictivo, estuvo varias veces en Irán. En una ocasión, invitado por el régimen, le ofrecieron un acuerdo similar al que luego firmó Timerman, que ya incluía el cese de las notificaciones rojas. En todas sus visitas a Irán, se entrevistó con altas autoridades del régimen, se fotografió -entre otros- con el prófugo Mohsen Rabbani, con quien está relacionado hace años. •	Que su correlato del lado iraní fue Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, máximo referente local del régimen, “la voz y oídos de Irán” en nuestro país, incluso con mayor poder real que el ex Encargado de Negocios de Irán. Militante a tiempo completo de los intereses persas, cumplió idénticas funciones que D’Elía en la transmisión de mensajes a través de los canales paralelos de comunicación y negociación, operando -de ese modo- como el referente de la diplomacia paralela que comunica Buenos Aires con Teherán, que fue aprovechada para la consecución del plan de impunidad. •	Que el funcionario de inteligencia con acceso al entorno presidencial conocido como “Alian”, con información privilegiada -incluso sobre la salud de la Sra. Presidente-, ha declarado su simpatía con el régimen iraní y ha actuado -en reiteradas ocasiones- a favor de intereses extranjeros en detrimento de los nacionales. Funcionó como nexo entre la Sra. Presidente y el referente local de Irán, Jorge Khalil, e impulsó desde las sombras y siguiendo órdenes de sus superiores, las acciones que aportaron al plan de impunidad. Explicó lo que se podía hacer y lo que no, lo que convenía y lo que podría molestar. Explicó también los pasos del gobierno, reveló información sensible y secreta a agentes al servicio de una potencia extranjera, como Khalil, y viabilizó la ejecución del encubrimiento, participando, en especial, en el armado de la nueva hipótesis criminal, para desplazar la versión sostenida por la justicia nacional, en base a las pruebas de la causa, que señala la responsabilidad de ciudadanos iraníes. •	Que el ex Fiscal designado, el día del atentado, para actuar en forma conjunta, alterna o sucesiva en la causa AMIA, Dr. Héctor Luis Yrimia, en razón de sus conocimientos detallados del expediente y su experiencia en la práctica judicial en materia penal, por haberse desempeñado además como Juez de la Nación, aportó valiosa información y consejos técnicos para el armado de esta nueva hipótesis falsa, de modo de tornarla verosímil y adaptable a la realidad de una causa judicial, que conocía por haber intervenido en su condición de Fiscal Federal. •	Que Femando Esteche fue un facilitador del plan criminal, que contribuyó activamente a encaminar las negociaciones en los canales paralelos. También fue Esteche quien acercó a Khalil a los funcionarios de inteligencia argentinos, permitiendo que se genere una importante vía de contacto directo entre los agentes de ambos países. Fue él quien sumó al Dr. Yrimia al plan, con todo lo que ello redundó en el perfeccionamiento de la pista falsa para redireccionar la investigación, a la que -además- aportó ideas concretas. •	Que el Diputado Nacional Andrés Larroque, contacto directo y asiduo con la Sra. Presidente de la Nación, por su cercanía y confianza fue elegido para cumplir el rol de nexo transmisor de las decisiones presidenciales a los ejecutores del plan criminal, a sabiendas de lo delictivas que eran. Se acreditaron distintos episodios en los que Larroque bajó estas directivas presidenciales, tanto a Khalil como a D'Elía, sobre cómo debían actuar. Como por ejemplo, la ocasión en que, en noviembre de 2012, Khalil reconoció: “...vengo de La Matanza recién he tenido una reunión con Luis D'Elía y el “Cuervo ” Larroque, el de la Cámpora...que me llamaron temprano que querían hablar conmigo, que tenían un mensaje para el gobierno para dar... Y ahora me voy para Martínez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador...”. Su intervención ha sido indispensable para evitar, por precaución, un contacto directo entre autores y partícipes del encubrimiento. Las conclusiones expuestas no son otras que las que razonable y lógicamente se derivan de un minucioso y detallado análisis de la prueba colectada. Conforme habrá podido apreciarse a lo largo de la denuncia, en la gran mayoría de los casos, dichas conclusiones surgen de prueba directa, mientras que en otros son el resultado de una serie de indicios y rigurosas deducciones lógicas que, por ser graves, inequívocos, precisos y concordantes con el resto de los elementos probatorios, contribuyen a solidificar la denuncia que se presenta. De este modo, se exponen las acciones inescrupulosas y delictivas de autores y partícipes del encubrimiento que han vulnerado el derecho vigente, han ultrajado la memoria de las víctimas, han lucrado políticamente con esas muertes y han abusado de la paciencia y buena fe de los sobrevivientes del atentado y familiares de las víctimas que buscan y esperan lo que, en definitiva, merecen: que se castigue con el máximo rigor de la ley a los responsables de este tenebroso acto de terrorismo. VII.	- Breves consideraciones normativas Ahora bien, conforme ya ha sido adelantado, el plan delictivo aquí denunciado encuadra, a priori, en las figuras penales de encubrimiento por favorecimiento personal agravado, impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional e incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionario público (arts. 277 inciso 1 y 3, 241 inciso 2 y 248 del Código Penal). En primer lugar, cabe señalar que el encubrimiento por favorecimiento personal (art. 277 inc. 1) se encuentra agravado respecto de algunos de los encartados, por su calidad de funcionarios públicos (art. 277 inc. 3o d); y -en todos los casos- por la especial gravedad del hecho precedente (art. 277 inc. 3o a). Como es sabido y aunque se configuran varias agravantes, éstas no concurren entre sí e imperará aquella que contenga -según el caso- mayores elementos de especialidad y abarque una mayor protección del bien jurídico tratado.   Ministerio Público de la Nación En segundo lugar, y solo en los casos de imputados que revistan la calidad de funcionarios públicos, una o varias de las acciones atribuidas son confígurativas del tipo penal previsto en el art. 248 del código de fondo, en virtud de los deberes funcionales específicos de cada cargo que fueron desatendidos en el curso del plan criminal. Ello, sin perjuicio, de la ulterior aplicación de la normativa concursal vigente. En tercer lugar, se entiende que la acción delictiva aquí individualizada y denunciada, encuadra también en la figura de impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional (art. 241 inc. 2 del Código Penal), dado que constituye un atentado contra la libertad en el ejercicio de la función pública, en el caso, de la actividad jurisdiccional en torno al caso AMIA. El normal desenvolvimiento de esa actividad desplegada por el juez Rodolfo Canicoba Corral y de la investigación del atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, que constituye el objeto procesal de la causa, se ve - cuanto menos- estorbada por la ejecución de un plan destinado a encubrir en el citado expediente a un grupo de imputados acusados de participar en el referido hecho de terrorismo. Más aún, desde el momento en que se suscribió el acuerdo con Irán, a esta altura ya se sabe, un instrumento cardinal en la maniobra de encubrimiento, se consumaron serias afectaciones al normal desenvolvimiento de los intercambios de información, elementos y demás piezas probatorias relevantes para la pesquisa del caso “AMIA”, implementados a través de los mecanismos de cooperación judicial internacional. El acuerdo firmado con Irán se traduce en restricciones y serias afectaciones a la recepción de información y documentación probatoria aportada por terceros estados para ser agregada al expediente judicial. Como bien se sabe, el acuerdo con la República Islámica incluye, entre sus disposiciones, la obligación de entregar la totalidad de las actuaciones en trámite ante la justicia argentina -no a los imputados, lo que corresponde por derecho- para su revisión por parte de la “Comisión de la Verdad” prevista en el convenio, para su posterior comunicación al gobierno de la República Islámica de Irán. Justamente, la eventual puesta en conocimiento de las autoridades iraníes de informaciones, investigaciones, revelaciones y/o conclusiones elaboradas por organismos y/o agencias extranjeras, constituye una severa perturbación a dichos canales internacionales que nutren a la causa de elementos probatorios de interés, lo que claramente se erige en una traba que opera en detrimento de la investigación. Habida cuenta que en la presente denuncia se encuentra involucrada una persona que, conforme a las probanzas reunidas, pertenece a la Secretaría de Inteligencia, y que en tal carácter ha tenido participación activa en los hechos delictivos aquí verificados; corresponde requerir al Sr. Secretario de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Nación que autorice el acceso a la totalidad de la información respecto de esta persona (arts. 16 y 17 de la Ley 25.520). VII.	- Medidas cautelares a)	Embargo Preventivo: En virtud de la gran cantidad de elementos de convicción que sustentan la presente denuncia, la extensión del daño causado por el delito y la multiplicidad de víctimas afectadas, se impone requerir al Sr. Juez el dictado de un embargo preventivo sobre los bienes de autores y partícipes de este encubrimiento de un crimen de lesa humanidad para asegurar la indemnización del daño material y moral causado a las víctimas y a sus familias (art. 29 del Código Penal) que una eventual - y en este caso, probable- sentencia condenatoria necesariamente deberá ordenar. Por lo demás, la medida cautelar solicitada impedirá que cualquiera de los   Ministerio Público de la Nación uberto nism/n FISCAL GENERAL/ imputados practique, durante el proceso, maniobras destinadas a insolventarse y, de ese modo, eludir sus obligaciones jurídicas. Efectivamente, el código ritual ha previsto de forma expresa la situación fáctica aquí planteada en su art. 518 al establecer: “Al dictar el auto de procesamiento, el juez ordenará el embargo de bienes del imputado...” para agregar en su parte final: “...las medidas cautelares podrán dictarse antes del auto de procesamiento, cuando hubiere peligro en la demora y elementos de convicción suficientes que las justifiquen”. Es decir, la ley autoriza la imposición de medidas cautelares de índole económica, como el embargo preventivo, antes del dictado del auto de procesamiento. En esos casos exige la concurrencia de dos requisitos para su procedencia: que haya elementos de convicción que la justifiquen y que exista peligro en la demora. El primer requisito se encuentra ampliamente verificado a partir de los sólidos elementos probatorios aportados en la presente denuncia que da cuenta del comportamiento delictivo de los imputados quienes, conforme se ha demostrado, han realizado todo tipo de maniobras destinadas a destruir las imputaciones de la causa AMIA poniendo en ejecución un sofisticado plan de encubrimiento cuyo objetivo es lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iraníes, violentando el derecho de las víctimas y sus familiares a lograr justicia. La segunda exigencia -peligro en la demora- se encuentra acreditada por la naturaleza extraordinaria del hecho ilícito denunciado, la entidad de los bienes jurídicos afectados y la falta total de escrúpulos de los sujetos aquí denunciados, lo que obliga al Sr. Juez a extremar los recaudos para evitar que nuevas maniobras y/o ardides dirigidos a la insolvencia personal de autores y partícipes de este delito perjudiquen nuevamente a las víctimas. Así, la demora en la aplicación de la medida cautelar requerida tornaría incierto o incluso ilusorio el derecho a compensación de las víctimas que supone una reparación plena y efectiva, además de apropiada y proporcional a la gravedad de la lesión. Es decir, cabe asumir con un alto grado de certeza que aquellas personas que no trepidaron en ejecutar un plan criminal de encubrimiento para destruir la investigación principal por el atentado a la AMIA, hagan lo propio para salvaguardar sus patrimonios personales, escapando así a las responsabilidades económicas derivadas de la comisión del delito denunciado. Así, el cúmulo probatorio que sustenta la presente denuncia justifica, por su propia solidez,	la	aplicación	de la medida	cautelar solicitada. En cuanto al monto	a	embargar,	más allá del	carácter preventivo de la medida, lo cierto	es	que según	la manda legal	debe ser suficiente para garantizar la pena pecuniaria, la indemnización civil y las costas. En esa inteligencia para	establecer la	suma resarcitoria debe atenderse tanto a la gravedad del hecho perpetrado, a la trascendencia institucional que reviste como al significativo número de víctimas, teniéndose en cuenta el daño efectivo sufrido más el daño moral provocado por el delito. En razón que resulta necesario efectuar una reparación integral por el daño causado, la multiplicidad de víctimas que se encuentran en posición de reclamar un resarcimiento por sus derechos afectados resulta determinante al momento de ponderar el monto del embargo. Nótese que existe una relación directa entre el delito y la denegación de justicia; que su duración ya ha consumido, solo hasta el momento, 18 largos meses; y que algunas de las personas involucradas en la maniobra tienen una altísima jerarquía institucional en el gobierno nacional. Estos parámetros han de ser tomados en consideración para calibrar adecuadamente la suma por la cual deben responder los acusados que, si bien resulta ser insusceptible de apreciación pecuniaria objetiva, es el único modo aceptado de reparación frente a la angustia, la desesperanza y la impotencia de quienes tienen que soportar un nuevo encubrimiento en la investigación del atentado contra la AMIA.   En atención a que la obligación de resarcir el daño provocado es solidaria entre todos los responsables, entiendo adecuado la imposición de la suma de $200.000.000 (doscientos millones de pesos). b)	Prohibición de salida del país: A los efectos de asegurar desde el inicio los fines del proceso, corresponde solicitar que V.S. decrete la inmediata prohibición de salir del país de Luis Ángel D'Elía, Fernando Luis Esteche, Jorge Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil y Héctor Luis Yrimia. El mismo temperamento corresponde adoptar respecto de “Alian”, quien deberá ser correctamente individualizado y que, según los indicios obtenidos hasta el momento, podría tratarse de Ramón Alian Héctor Bogado. En relación a los restantes imputados en esta presentación - Cristina Elisabet Fernández, Héctor Marcos Timerman y Andrés Larroque-, teniendo en cuenta los altos cargos públicos que ejercen, como así también los fueros de los se encuentran investidos, a juicio del suscripto, no se advierten -por el momento- circunstancias que ameriten asegurar su sujeción al proceso mediante esta medida. Ello, sin perjuicio de que el criterio aquí articulado pueda modificarse, conforme a derecho. Por lo demás, la gravedad institucional de esta denuncia, en tanto involucra a un Presidente de la Nación y a un Ministro del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional en ejercicio y a otros funcionarios de alta jerarquía dentro del gobierno nacional, no debe -sin embargo- convertirse en obstáculo para la investigación judicial y el desempeño de las tareas propias de un Poder Judicial independiente, máxime teniendo en cuenta la seriedad de los hechos aquí anoticiados. Muy por el contrario, la celeridad para aclarar estos graves hechos, resulta imperativa. Finalmente, se entiende corresponde formular la presente denuncia ante el Juzgado Nacional en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal N°4 a cargo del Dr. Ariel Lijo, quien ya se encuentra interviniendo en relación con hechos e irregularidades pasadas de esta investigación, que también involucran falsas acusaciones para direccionar erróneamente la pesquisa y/o el encubrimiento de imputados para su protección. Esas investigaciones, que tramitaron y -en parte aún tramitan- ante el Juzgado del Dr. Lijo, tienen identidad procesal con los hechos que aquí se denuncian, en tanto también se refieren a actividades destinadas a encubrir a imputados por el atentado, aun cuando hayan sido desplegadas por distintos sujetos activos y en distintos momentos de la tramitación de la pesquisa. Lo cierto es que en ambos casos, se trata de maniobras delictivas destinadas a entorpecer la investigación judicial por el atentado contra la AMIA. En este sentido, corresponde tener presente que el Ministerio Público Fiscal es un órgano independiente, con autonomía funcional y autarquía financiera, que tiene por función promover la actuación de la justicia en defensa de la legalidad y de los intereses generales de la sociedad (art. 120 de la Constitución Nacional y Ley Nacional N° 24.946) y, en cumplimiento de esos mandatos funcionales y de lo normado en el art. 177 inc. Io del Código Procesal Penal, vengo a formular la presente denuncia, por considerar que los hechos aquí expuestos encuentran “prima facie” adecuación jurídica en las figuras de encubrimiento por favorecimiento personal agravado, impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional e incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionario público, previstas en los arts. 277 inc. 1 y 3, 241 inc. 2 y 248 del Código Penal. X- Petitorio; Por todo lo expuesto, solicito al Sr. Juez que: I.	-	Se tenga por formulada la presente denuncia en virtud del mandato dispuesto en el art. 177 inc. Io del Código Procesal Penal de la Nación y que le dé curso, conforme el procedimiento previsto en el citado cuerpo legal. II.	-	Se tome razón de lo dispuesto en el punto VIII in fine, en los términos de los arts. 16 y 17 de la ley 25.520, a los fines que VS. estime correspondan.   Vil.- Se reciba.declaración indagatoria, conforme lo normado en el art. 29 í c oi Código Procesal Penal de la Nación a Cristina Eiisabet Fernández., Héctor Marcos Timerman, Luis Ángel D’Elía, Femando Luis Estech . crg>; Alejandro “Yussuf’ Khalil, Héctor Luis Yrimia. Andrés Larroque y r.’ sujeto identificado como “Alian” que, según los indicios obtenidos hasta (! ...omento, podría tratarse de Ramón Héctor Alian Bogado. YIII.- Se trabe embargo preventivo respecto de Cristina Eiisabet Fernández. Hécor Marcos Timerman, Femando Luis Esteche, Luis Angel D’Elír, Héctor Luis Yrimia, Jorge Alejandro Khalíl y Andrés Larroque, hasta cubrir la suma de doscientos millones de pesos ($ 200.000.000), en forma solidaria, en aplicación de lo normado en el art. 518 del Código Procesal fonal de la Nación, lo que así expresamente se solicita al Sr. Juez.

Nah, there'll be none of that babe My plan leaves in about an hour I don't think so My tour starts when I get back But, um... thanks for calling anyway It's been nice knowing you, well it was nice knowing you You take care of yourself Oh, and don't give out my number Thanks  [Verse 1] Now I can still remember when we first met It was one day that I would never forget Six o'clock the approximate hour Not really cloudy, expecting sun showers I was taking a stroll halfway cross town Then like expected the rain came down I picked up my pace For home base I raced Ran into a soft object in my haste On the ground we faced Her in silk and lace And with my eyes, her body I slowly cased The pouring rain had drenched her dress But I loved the way the cloth had clinged and caressed ""Excuse me"", that was my first words spoke Stood her up on her feet and gave her my trench coat Somehow it happened while I covered her back When her eyes and mine first made contact The looks we gave changed the way we were Now it was us and not me and her Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might I guess you would call it love at first sight  [Hook]  [Verse 2] Now even the rain pour was easy to ignore Only this young lady is what I saw She was a sweet female, tender not frail Other words beautiful, no need for details I introduced myself, ""Hi, my name is Dane Can I get you out of this pouring rain?"" ""Sure,"" she said.  ""By the way, I'm Jackie."" Staring at me as I hailed down the taxi We jumped in. The cab slowly moved off She was holding my hand and it felt so soft Now on my ear she gently chewed And I knew it was more than just gratitude I took it upon myself to take her to my house I guess she didn't mind because her clothes were doused Paid the cab his fee Took out my house keys Opened up the door, said ""Enter please"" Took her to the bathroom, said ""Hang your clothes on the line"" And gave her one of my shirts from Calvin Klein Went to my room took off my wet wardrobe I freshened up a bit and put on my silk robe We met in the front near the roaring flames Where we sat quietly sipping on champagne Her eyes said ""Thanks"" beyond the use of words And the crackling flame was all I heard It felt as though we were on our honeymoon As we moved from the front into the bedroom We made passion love the night we met And by the time we fell asleep there were no regrets Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might I guess you would call it love at first sight  [Hook x2]  [Verse 3] I woke up the next morning.  She was not there Maybe she's fixing breakfast or doing her hair I got out of my bed, threw on me house coat When I noticed on the mirror she'd left a note Saying, ""Sorry Dane, I could not stay Please meet me 1 o'clock where we met yesterday."" Well, I had time.  Two hours and a half So I laid out my clothes and took a bath I ate a good breakfast, had time to spare So then I got dressed and I dally over there I reached my destination not a cloud in sight It was cool, kinda windy, but the sun was bright Now I was on time, but she didn't show And that was about twenty minutes ago I stayed a little longer, about a half an hour Felt a raindrop, maybe it's a sun shower I was soon to see that my thoughts were wrong Because the raindrop became an all-out storm And there I was standing in the rain And the lady that I looked for never came Well, I was hurt and it showed in my face As I tracked in the rain backed to my place Slowly I walked hoping to bump into her Me be in love? Nah, I barely knew her I got home angry and depressed And my Bally shoes were a total mess But that was the last thing on my mind As I sat on the couch staring into time Well, I had her number and she had mine But if she really wanted me she would have dropped me a line But day after day and weeks went by But she didn't call even to say, ""Hi"" I would have called her first, but I've got my pride ""And I really don't care"", to myself I lied Now, there was no reason for me to be sad Just remember that good time that we had 'Cause I learned a little something that you should know To keep some things you got to let them go Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might I guess you would call it love at first sight  [Hook x2]  [Outro] ...

memory plays out like a movie that never ends hearing so many voices in my head always saying  one thing and meaning something totally different day after day you been trying to put the puzzle of  life together but instead you end up fighting fire with fire till everything explodes right before your eyes and  you begin to wonder if all 18 years of your life has just been a waste of time feeling unwanted everything  grows dark feel the flames rise inside me feel the flames rise inside me feel the flames rise inside me as  the anger, stress. irritation and pain flares up inside yet still even if I wanted to I just can’t all because  10 years straight nonstop I just hold everything inside now just feel the flames rise inside me feel the flames  rise inside me feel the flames rise inside me as I try so hard to pretend everything is ok when I have no idea  what to say or do mainly because no one can make up their mind or even tell me what’s going on why people  are always worried about me but can never tell me what it is there worried about why can’t I let anything go is it  because I don’t know what it is I’m letting go so now feel the flames rise inside me feel the flames rise inside  me feel the flames rise inside me imagine your self-holding everything inside for 10 years pretending your  ok when you’re not This Song Was Written by Natalie Marie Howell age 18 Typed by Natalie Marie Howell age 18   Everyone has a dream but not everyone works hard 2 make it come true  everyone has a dream but not everyone works hard 2 make it come true everyone has a dream  but not everyone works hard 2 make it come true people always act differently when their individual’s  and when there around other people question is why think about it when where individual’s  we all want to be something and someone in life we all have a goal a dream that we want to follow but  than when where around other people we change our tone our action we change our mind  about how we see ourselves but why some feel like they can’t do anything in this world so they  make others feel and believe the same thing unfortunately that’s not the case see everyone has a dream  but not everyone works hard to make it come true everyone has a dream but not everyone  works hard to make it come true so you have this thought that some have dragged someone else down  will get you exactly what you been wanting but really it just adds on and it feels like you just can’t get  it right however as long as your heart and mind is set on a dream that you have and truly believe  you can make it come true go for it don’t let anyone get in your way case the way I see it is  everyone has a dream but not everyone works hard 2 make it come true everyone has a dream  but not everyone works hard to make it come true and so these people feel like well is someone  else has the same dream as me they can’t even pull it off just because I didn’t make my dream come true  everyone has a dream but not everyone works hard 2 make it come true THIS SONG WAS WRITTEN BY NATALIE MARIE HOWELL AGE 18 TYPED BY NATALIE MARIE HOWELL AGE 18    Chained down I wish I could tell you everything is ok I wish I could just be relaxed  and happy but I can’t I been holding all my anger, pain, stress, hate inside always  watching what I say and do its been going on for 10 years straight doesn’t matter who or  what that’s always going on no matter how you look at it I’m always chain down chain  down to this dark cold world and can’t break free 10 years I been watching what I want to say  because every time I say and do something people get worried talk to everyone they know  behind my back than call the police on me you do realize I relive every memory  I have you think that I don’t do anything and won’t do anything about what  people do and or say to me when actually I’m just holding it  all in letting it build up for 10 years’ straight now everything has caught  up with me and I no longer have energy for life I been broken down and shattered  into pieces my world is crashing down all around me which I’m chain down chain down  chain down 10 years I been pretending I was ok and to this day I still pretend  everything is ok however I just can’t keep going on like this tell me can I do anything  what am I good for in this world if all I’ve ever done was being chain down holding back  everything I wanted to say and do just because I could never find a way to re word just what  I’m feeling inside which brings me right back to being chain down  THIS SONG WAS WRITTEN BY NATALIE MARIE HOWELL AGE 18 TYPED

are days when I feel like I been on a road that was not meant for me and  still haven’t changed roads father God I believe in you I believe in your son Jesus Christ and the crucifixion  he went through to pay the price of my sin yet somehow I still have this feeling that somethings wrong  and I don’t know what it is father I trust you with my life and every thing that I am but please father  God tell me how do you see me father God how do you see me when you see my heart what does it look  like in your eyes is it ok is it good or did it just shatter so many times that it will always be worn out father  God how do you see my heart what is it exactly that you see in me that has value to you I know you have a plan for me and I want to carry out that plan but am I on the right road to carry out your plan for me  father God how do you see my heart father God how do you see my heart THIS SONG WAS WRITTEN BY NATALIE MARIE HOWELL AGE 18   As of now I will never use my voice again  you know I had so many people tell me or ask me how I’m doing what’s on my mind and what I feel inside they  all have asked me about relationships and why I don’t have one I tried to tell you vocally but  you cut me off I wrote it out 100 different times in 100 different ways and yet you still don’t seem to know  me instead you rather just tell me story for me though you haven’t been with me from the very beginning  maybe it’s something I said maybe its something I’ve done but no matter what it is or how many times I try  to tell you my life story you just cut me off every time you’re worried about me you talk about it behind  my back thinking I won’t find out and when I do you ask me why I’m pissed I maybe 18 years old and not  have a job just yet and not pay any bills at the moment but that doesn’t mean I don’t have a reason to be  stressed out as much as I am I try so hard to pretend I’m ok when I’m not every day I say I’m ok but really I  just don’t know what to say but I been thinking if all you’re going to do is cut me off then all I have to say  is as of now I will never use me. voice again as if now I will never use my voice again because I’m just  wasting my breath by trying to tell my life story and you just don’t care about it until of course I’m pissed  and you want to know why once I tell you I hear you have no reason to be mad at me case I haven’t done  anything to you really you’re going to say that to me when I just told you what I was pissed about are you  that stupid now I know people worry about me I know they care about me and I appreciate that but if you have  any problems that some how involves me in anyway what’s so ever and instead of coming to me you  just call the police I will have a problem when you tell me to watch what I say why do you always think  I’m quite about almost everything and try so hard to be alone it’s because if I can’t say what I want to say  you’re basically telling me I can’t use my voice now with that said as of now I will never use my voice again  as of now I will never use my voice again I don’t care who it is or what the situation is my voice clearly  doesn’t matter at all so as of now I will never use my voice again as of now I will never use my voice again  till you can give me a hell of a reason why I should still use my voice till you can stop cutting me off  all the time and just listen to me than I will use my voice again but until that day comes all I can say is as of  now I will never use my voice again I will never use my voice again doesn’t matter what the case is just  had enough of this as of now I will never use my voice again THIS SONG WAS WRITTEN BY NATALIE MARIE HOWELL AGE 18 TYPED BY NATALIE MARIE HOWELL AGE 18 moments like this  moments like the one I’m in right now is where I wish I could just shut everyone out of my life  a moment where I could just be with out anyone in life I don’t know what to do right now but more important  I don’t know who to believe each side has been so convincing on saying whose lying and who’s not  you know I can’t even believe that I don’t have to choose who to let go and who to stay friends with though  it kills me inside I know one day everything will just unravel when it doses that day I will just shut  everyone out and push people away you think I’m not happy in life there’s a reason for that I’m clearly not  allowed to be happy apparently moments like this is just tearing me apart case I want to some  how bring us all together yet all of you are so wrapped on who did what and who said what all these  secrets and lies I don’t know bout you but I can’t do this anymore watching all go into war telling  me it’s all going to be ok when every one knows how this is going to end I care so much of all of you and  having this

see the ones, I care about just fall apart right before me I tried to say  something I tried to do something but I was just caged up inside I always pull back when people  desperately tried to start up battles case the pain I’m in but don’t want want anyone to know I been told so many times I have a voice that I should use it but I been cut off so many times you don’t remember me  ever using my voice in fact only time you really know my voice is when I’m singing and once again  I’m caged up inside caged up inside caged up inside many times I tried telling my life story yet no one ever  listen you just cut me off and go do your own thing talks to people around you laugh bout nothing yet  you still bother trying to figure me out why what’s the point what is it you’re looking for all you’ll find is a  girl caged up inside trapped in life waiting for only one Savior one king one father to help me here  find out who she is what she’s mad for a few times shell be caged up inside caged up inside every  memory she’s ever created flowing through here mind both good and bad times rooming around into deep  thought and for what just to find out who she is where she belongs in this life many times I tried writing  my life story turned it all into songs through my life will come to an end my story will live on no matter what  I maybe caged up inside right now but one day I will come out as the inner me the person I was created  to be just needs time to figure that out right now until than I’ll be caged inside caged inside caged  inside this life you can walk over me take advantage of me but really what your doing is becoming part  of my life story that will be known when I’m no longer caged up inside THIS SONG WAS WRITTEN BY  NATALIE MARIE HOWELL AGE 17 TYPED BY

around see pain and suffering  darkness all around I put myself in everyone’s position in every situatuation and when I try to do  something when I try to help in any way I can I find myself getting burned than fire rises through my  eyes and I start walking through fire I walk through fire walk through fire gives you scars  that you can't change pain you just can't let go question’s flaring through your mind and you feel  alone there’s no hope out of this but than you get this small feeling like there’s a way out so you sit down  and think things through and when you can't figure it out you begin to walk through fire walk through fire  you walk through fire because its all you can do and when it’s all over you wonder what will people think  or say and would I care or not but for now, while I’m still alive in this world I will walk through fire walk   through fire the bigger the problem the bigger the fire the more stress the more it explodes  yet you keep walking because you walk through fire walk through fire walk through fire it’s the only thing  you can do at this point so you close your eyes taking the anger and you walk through fire  THIS SONG WAS WRITTEN BY NATALIE MARIE

every day  I try so hard to hold all my pain I try so hard not to show how bad I’m hurting everyone always  throwing rocks and what ever else they can find boys always trying to get me in a relationship  girls always telling me I need a man in my life to be happy but that’s not true I have God right by my side he  is all I need to be happy everyone always playing there sick twisted games refusing to see what there  doing to me refusing to realize that hurting people just case there hurting is pointless the battle of  my heart is the battle of my mind I can't do anything or give you everything you want because I  rather focused on my relationship with my Savior and my Heavenly Father but all this nagging asking  me for money you know I don’t have I just couldn't put up with it anymore that now the battle of me  heart is the battle of my mind the battle of my mind is the battle of my heart and it just grows inside  every day every time you just put me through hell all the time you know I’m starting to get even  worse because people always twist my words around and always calling the police just case they  can't come tell me what there so dam worried about always those who are f…. watching me you  won't ever fully understand me and whey I do what I do I’m tired of people who can't make up there  dam mind of all people who want me to do everything for them just case there too lazy to do it them  selves with that said the battle of my heart is the battle of my mind the battle of my heart is the  battle of my mind to tell me I don’t have a reason to live and to kill me self you have no idea how many  times I tried and couldn't but I was hurting weather, you saw it or not weather you believe it or not I was  hurting and you know I blame myself for what all did to me and for what you all said to me  I still till this day ask myself what did I do or say to you for you to treat me this way just can't take it  anymore and now this is what its all come down to the battle of my heart is the battle of my mind  the battle of my heart is the battle of my mind the battle of my heart is the battle of my mind  when I try to make things work when I try to overcome evil with good I get burned, hurt, scared and  shattered I ran out of hope, love peace, faith and so much more its unbelievable and sad as well as  disappointing but hey whey should that matter to any of you at all for any reason you wonder why I lost  all trust for people whey I hate people so much but still try to love them anyway well take a look at  my life put yourself in every position every angle every aspect every decision from small to big  than tell me if you can see it now and believe me when I say that the battle of my heart is the battle  of my mind the battle of my heart is the battle of my mind you know? I can only do so much at once and  work hard to hold back from doing or saying anything I may regret later on in life you say it’s pointless  to care what anyone else says thinks or dose to someone I think it’s sad and disappointing  and unbelievable to say that because you’re basically saying you don’t care if that person lives or  dies and if they killed themselves you wouldn't care tell you find out the reason they killed themselves  you to begin with see now whey I said the battle of my heart is the battle of my mind the battle of  my heart is the battle of my mind it never ends case you never leave me alone you always bring up what  I went through in the past than you wonder why I never let go whey I never forget about it all see all  make up one theory after another refusing to listen to my story you don’t want to hear a word from me  but then when I don’t use my voice you wonder why you hit me when you don’t get what you want you  think it’s funny and a game until something goes wrong and you think what just happened what did  I do and you look for ways to blame someone else for something you did all do everything to pretend  nothing’s wrong and move on with your life but you can't now your inside my mind and can't escape now you can see that the battle of my heart is the battle of my mind the battle of my heart is the  battle of my mind there’s no way around it no way to avoid it no matter how bad you wish you  could there’s no turning back because the battle of my heart is the battle of mind the battle of  my heart is the battle of my mind THIS SONG WAS

to be treated most of all I ember reading where you said you didn’t come for the rightists  instead you came for the sinners to give us another chance to have an everlasting life with you if only  we believe out of that you find hope so it’s this time of the year where hope and love came into this  world people changed some for the better some for the worse but those who changed for the better can

continually you just won’t be able to  tell for a while case I won’t show it but trust me when I say I’m destroying myself on the inside right now case  of all these lies and secrets all this talk about leaving or killing your self I tried so hard and hoped for  as long as I could that one day you all would just get along and accept each other for who you really  are now I keep thinking and after hearing all of you I’m sorry can’t do this anymore Cherelle, Korrey &  Fayth I’m sorry as much as this all kills me I am aware that once I say this you will not allow me to see  Fayth ever again and we can’t ever see here again but this is where I tell you I can’t keep this up anymore  this is where I leave this world and not come back go ahead try to talk me out of it give me a hell of reason  to believe that this is over that you all can get along and accept people for who they are case as of now  there’s nothing I can do I told all before that I could never choose between all that it would kill me  inside if I had to countless times I had this feeling and now this day is coming I was just hoping I was  wrong and that we could all just get along by the way Cherelle your dad was hitting on me and you can tell  him to stay out of my life for good sorry but this is what it’s come down to if there was something I could do  something I could say for all to just accept each other for who all really are I would but I can’t  force you to put up with anyone you can’t seem to deal with right now all I know is I will never be the same  again I will put up with a lot ill even put up with some of the we say to each other and do to each  other but now that it’s all come down to this I got to leave this world I got to leave this world I can’t put  up with this like I said before if God is pissed please let him take it out on me case I cannot stand by and  watch all get hurt again I’m already with pain/anger/stress etc. but all have a daughter together  and one day she’s going to know who we all are and whey you can’t let here come see us anymore how  do you think Fayth will react when she learns the whole truth bout what was said and done she would  most like be distressed but hey its not like all could just easily accept each other just to stay friends and  here I thought family cares supposed to stick by you though everything I thought family do one of the most  important thing in life but look at us now whey all of us is falling apart and as for me I’m starting  a blood bath inside what happened to us what have we all done for this I don’t know about you but

so hard to  pretend I’m ok when I’m not but even then I’ll always be standing even when I fall or mess up ill always  be standing you know what I can’t understand why do we all look for a reason to hate each other  some people madder other people others commit suicide or attempt to commit suicide because they feel like  they don’t have a reason to live wonder where that feeling comes from but mainly whey can’t people  accept people 4 who they are is it that hard to do if all you had to do in life was accept each other for  who they are on the inside but even then maybe if people would just listen for once I know how bad  this economy has been and still is I know that we don’t have a good government or president for that  matter but you know what other people have it so much worse we steel have freedom some people  don’t you know what kills me more than anything is seeing people out on the streets and families who can’t  eat every day or at all for that matter I wish there was something I can do but right now I just feel  useless but even so I’ll always be standing because I’m not alone in this life I have family/friends who  care for me and love me for who I am but most of all I have a Father king/ Savior/friend who will never  leave my side no matter what I’ve done even if I failed many times his always here with open arms  I’ll always be standing I’ll always be

to begin at this point and time the way this school works  is disappointing really you say we need certain classes to graduate all said we needed speech to graduate  but what I don’t understand is how the hell could you sit here and tell us what classes we f…. need to  get the hell out of this dam school you can't even talk to each other about who dose what tell me who  the hell is in charge of sinning case mangers and to tell me about it whose job is it to tell me anything  that has to do anything with me or are all so dam f… scared you don’t have the dam common  sense to step up to me face to face and tell me your dam selves with all you what is wrong with all of you  all this talk about how you want us to pass and graduate it’s all bulls… its nothing but crap but you don’t give  a dam does you you’ll never actually listen you have no command sense to keep everyone informed with  anything but what I find so devastating is the fact that all have the school behind all care so much  bout the money their f… blind to realize the schools dam systems is f… stupid look around who the  hell do you think you’re dealing with think about it if nothing else think about who can stand up and answer  me what is wrong with you what is wrong with you what is wrong please tell me take the time to  open up your eyes and you see this isn’t working all are just in there for the money you’re telling us you  care but what you really want is the money tell me face to face that’s not true I dare you in fact I triple dog  dare you to come tell me face to face and tell me it’s not about the money you can't can you and that’s  sad we shouldn't be worried bout money as long as we all can work together and help each other out  but all are so dam into the f… compaction all don’t give a f… what’s wrong with you what’s wrong  with you everyone is different deal with it no one is not meant to be the same everyone is special in there  own way yet all try so f… hard to be the same and for what whey tries to be someone your not  let me tell you everyone has a dream however not everyone works hard to make it come true and for  that reason all do what you’re doing now its radicalize and

2 open up 2 people I just can't do it not after the hell you put me through and  when you ask me if I’m ok when you see me looking like something is bothering me but don’t talk  about it just hold it all inside you know I’m not opening up 2 people opening up 2 people opening up  2 people is like telling people you know can't be trusted yet you tell them everything before you know  it everyone knows whey your hurting inside and instead of helping you through it they  make it worse by telling you can't be mad at anyone for anything its extremely hard and I don’t think  I can just come out of nowhere and start opening up 2 people opening up 2 people opening up 2 people I’m  still broken inside and trying to hide it just makes it go deeper I don’t sleep much anymore wishing  it would all end yet it repeats now tell me if you been through every thing I been though is opening  up 2 people really an option at this point not really an option for me in fact, it’s just another obstacle  in life that make things so much harder so opening up 2 people opening up 2 people is like  opening yourself to danger and pain is that really something you really want to do I don’t know about  you but I have enough to deal with as it is now I’m going to have to work on opening up 2 people opening up  2 people is extremely hard to do when people don’t or won't listen to your life long story so what

there’s the name calling you doing that it’s something you just  wanted to say but I know your hurting inside and even so it still doesn’t give you a right to  hurt someone else just to feel good bout yourself in fact tell me this do you honestly feel good about your . self by hurting other people or is it just an ongoing game it’s just an on going game, it’s just an ongoing game  that just can't seem to end when will you wake up and realize what’s going on around you when will  your body wake up and say ok this needs to change when will you open up your eyes and see that  all your doing is casing more pain come on look around and you think it’s all just a game playing with  people’s lives like it’s not a big deal but when there gone and not came back that’s when you freak out and  worry

for me to go back in the house and cheek again I finally started to walk  away and you held on to my arm again you wanted me to go back in the house and cheek again then  you fell and scraped your back and started yelling at me like it’s my felt as we headed through the ditch wasn't  long when we were heading for the bridge around the comer before you said I wasn't a good friend that I  didn’t care about anyone else but me self I ignored it and kept going you kept nagging me I just had to turn  around and yell what the hell do you want do your remember what you said you said you wanted me to suffer  the way you did you felt so violated than we kept walking you started pushing me now we reach the  bridge on the other side where you said you think your life is so perfect well it’s not and you need to stop  saying that it is case it’s not well you can keep pretending your life is perfect while I live my non  perfect life case at least I can say me life isn’t perfect I just couldn't believe what you just said that I turned around  and said b… I don’t know where you got the idea of my life being perfect case you sure as hell didn’t get it  from me in fact you have no idea how losses or how I feel inside my life is far from perfect than you told me you  I wish you would regret this day that you will not sleep case of this day and I was frozen solid I didn’t know  what to say or do I felt my heart stop I couldn't breathe I couldn't move I blacked out while my legs where  frozen solid than I was looking for you I was too late you were already gone and your wish came true I  haven't slept since and I stopped eating from time to time case of your wish and now I just want you to look at  me now take a look at me take a look at me take a look at me I’m so much worse

however those  who only look at the outside dose not know how to look on the inside they can't read through the lives case they  don’t even put themselves in someone else's dark times so they don’t think that every heart is  a good heart but if you ask me I believe every heart is a good heart every heart is a good heart just  case people call you names or says whatever they say or even if they hit you and through stuff at you  doesn’t mean they have a bad heart it just means something is bothering than they try not to show it and I  think that by making someone else mad, sad, hurtful or

These consolidated cases present challenges to state laws regulating the sale of wine from out-of-state wineries to consumers in Michigan and New York. The details and mechanics of the two regulatory schemes differ, but the object and effect of the laws are the same: to allow in-state wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that State but to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the least, to make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint. It is evident that the object and design of the Michigan and New York statutes is to grant in-state wineries a competitive advantage over wineries located beyond the States' borders.  We hold that the laws in both States discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, and that the discrimination is neither authorized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which invalidated the Michigan laws; and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which upheld the New York laws. ILike many other States, Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation of alcoholic beverages, including wine, through a three-tier distribution system. Separate licenses are required for producers, wholesalers, and retailers. See FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E–Commerce: Wine 5–7 (July 2003) (hereinafter FTC Report), available at http:// www. ftc. gov/ os/ 2003/ 07/ winereport 2. pdf (all Internet materials as visited May 11, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). The three-tier scheme is preserved by a complex set of overlapping state and federal regulations. For example, both state and federal laws limit vertical integration between tiers. Id., at 5; 27 U.S.C. § 205; see, e.g.,  Bainbridge v. Turner, 311 F.3d 1104, 1106 (C.A.11 2002). We have held previously that States can mandate a three-tier distribution scheme in the exercise of their authority under the Twenty-first Amendment. North Dakota v. United States, 495 U.S. 423, 432, 110 S.Ct. 1986, 109 L.Ed.2d 420 (1990); id., at 447, 110 S.Ct. 1986 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). As relevant to today's cases, though, the three-tier system is, in broad terms and with refinements to be discussed, mandated by Michigan and New York only for sales from out-of-state wineries. In-state wineries, by contrast, can obtain a license for direct sales to consumers. The differential treatment between in-state and out-of-state wineries constitutes explicit discrimination against interstate commerce.  This discrimination substantially limits the direct sale of wine to consumers, an otherwise emerging and significant business. FTC Report 7. From 1994 to 1999, consumer spending on direct wine shipments doubled, reaching $500 million per year, or three percent of all wine sales. Id., at 5. The expansion has been influenced by several related trends. First, the number of small wineries in the United States has significantly increased. By some estimates there are over 3,000 wineries in the country, WineAmerica, The National Association of American Wineries, Wine Facts 2004, http:// www.americanwineries.org/newsroom/winefacts04.htm, more than three times the number 30 years ago, FTC Report 6. At the same time, the wholesale market has consolidated. Between 1984 and 2002, the number of licensed wholesalers dropped from 1,600 to 600. Riekhof & Sykuta, Regulating Wine by Mail, 27 Regulation, No. 3, pp. 30, 31 (Fall 2004), available at http:// www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv27n3/v27n3–3.pdf. The increasing winery-to-wholesaler ratio means that many small wineries do not produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products. FTC Report 6. This has led many small wineries to rely on direct shipping to reach new markets. Technological improvements, in particular the ability of wineries to sell wine over the Internet, have helped make direct shipments an attractive sales channel.  Approximately 26 States allow some direct shipping of wine, with various restrictions. Thirteen of these States have reciprocity laws, which allow direct shipment from wineries outside the State, provided the State of origin affords similar nondiscriminatory treatment. Id., at 7–8. In many parts of the country, however, state laws that prohibit or severely restrict direct shipments deprive consumers of access to the direct market. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), “[s]tate bans on interstate direct shipping represent the single largest regulatory barrier to expanded e-commerce in wine.” Id., at 3.  The wine producers in the cases before us are small wineries that rely on direct consumer sales as an important part of their businesses. Domaine Alfred, one of the plaintiffs in the Michigan suit, is a small winery located in San Luis Obispo, California. It produces 3,000 cases of wine per year. Domaine Alfred has received requests for its wine from Michigan consumers but cannot fill the orders because of the State's direct-shipment ban. Even if the winery could find a Michigan wholesaler to distribute its wine, the wholesaler's markup would render shipment through the three-tier system economically infeasible.   Similarly, Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, two of the plaintiffs in the New York suit, operate small wineries in Virginia (the Swedenburg Estate Vineyard) and California (the Lucas Winery). Some of their customers are tourists, from other States, who purchase wine while visiting the wineries. If these customers wish to obtain Swedenburg or Lucas wines after they return home, they will be unable to do so if they reside in a State with restrictive direct-shipment laws. For example, Swedenburg and Lucas are unable to fill orders from New York, the Nation's second-largest wine market, because of the limits that State imposes on direct wine shipments. AWe first address the background of the suit challenging the Michigan direct-shipment law. Most alcoholic beverages in Michigan are distributed through the State's three-tier system. Producers or distillers of alcoholic beverages, whether located in state or out of state, generally may sell only to licensed in-state wholesalers. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§ 436.1109(1), 436.1305, 436.1403, 436.1607(1) (West 2000); Mich. Admin. Code Rules 436.1705 (1990), 436.1719 (2000). Wholesalers, in turn, may sell only to in-state retailers. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§ 436.1113(7), 436.1607(1) (West 2001). Licensed retailers are the final link in the chain, selling alcoholic beverages to consumers at retail locations and, subject to certain restrictions, through home delivery. §§ 436.1111(5), 436.1203(2)-(4).  Under Michigan law, wine producers, as a general matter, must distribute their wine through wholesalers. There is, however, an exception for Michigan's approximately 40 in-state wineries, which are eligible for “wine maker” licenses that allow direct shipment to in-state consumers. § 436.1113(9) (West 2001); §§ 436.1537(2)-(3) (West Supp.2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1011(7)(b) (2003). The cost of the license varies with the size of the winery. For a small winery, the license is $25. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 436.1525(1)(d) (West Supp.2004). Out-of-state wineries can apply for a $300 “outside seller of wine” license, but this license only allows them to sell to in-state wholesalers. §§ 436.1109(9) (West 2001), 436.1525(1)(e) (West Supp.2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1719(5) (2000).  Some Michigan residents brought suit against various state officials in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Domaine Alfred, the San Luis Obispo winery, joined in the suit. The plaintiffs contended that Michigan's direct-shipment laws discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause. The trade association Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers intervened as a defendant. Both the State and the wholesalers argued that the ban on direct shipment from out-of-state wineries is a valid exercise of Michigan's power under § 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.  On cross-motions for summary judgment the District Court sustained the Michigan scheme. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. Heald v. Engler, 342 F.3d 517 (2003). Relying on Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U.S. 263, 104 S.Ct. 3049, 82 L.Ed.2d 200 (1984), the court rejected the argument that the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes all state liquor laws from the strictures of the Commerce Clause, 342 F.3d, at 524, and held the Michigan scheme was unconstitutional because the defendants failed to demonstrate the State could not meet its proffered policy objectives through nondiscriminatory means, id., at 527. BNew York's licensing scheme is somewhat different. It channels most wine sales through the three-tier system, but it too makes exceptions for in-state wineries. As in Michigan, the result is to allow local wineries to make direct sales to consumers in New York on terms not available to out-of-state wineries. Wineries that produce wine only from New York grapes can apply for a license that allows direct shipment to in-state consumers. N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law Ann. § 76–a(3) (West Supp.2005) (hereinafter N.Y. ABC Law). These licensees are authorized to deliver the wines of other wineries as well, § 76–a(6)(a), but only if the wine is made from grapes “at least seventy-five percent the volume of which were grown in New York state,” § 3(20–a). An out-of-state winery may ship directly to New York consumers only if it becomes a licensed New York winery, which requires the establishment of “a branch factory, office or storeroom within the state of New York.” § 3(37).  Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, joined by three of their New York customers, brought suit in the Southern District of New York against the officials responsible for administering New York's Alcoholic Beverage Control Law seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the State's limitations on the direct shipment of out-of-state wine violate the Commerce Clause. New York liquor wholesalers and representatives of New York liquor retailers intervened in support of the State.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs. 232 F.Supp.2d 135 (2002). The court first determined that, under established Commerce Clause principles, the New York direct-shipment scheme discriminates against out-of-state wineries. Id., at 146–147. The court then rejected the State's Twenty-first Amendment argument, finding that the “[d]efendants have not shown that New York's ban on the direct shipment of out-of-state wine, and particularly the in-state exceptions to the ban, implicate the State's core concerns under the Twenty-first Amendment.” Id., at 148.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. 358 F.3d 223 (2004). The court “recognize[d] that the physical presence requirement could create substantial dormant Commerce Clause problems if this licensing scheme regulated a commodity other than alcohol.” Id., at 238. The court nevertheless sustained the New York statutory scheme because, in the court's view, “New York's desire to ensure accountability through presence is aimed at the regulatory interests directly tied to the importation and transportation of alcohol for use in New York,” ibid. As such, the New York direct-shipment laws were “within the ambit of the powers granted to states by the Twenty-first Amendment.” Id., at 239. CWe consolidated these cases and granted certiorari on the following question: “ ‘Does a State's regulatory scheme that permits in-state wineries directly to ship alcohol to consumers but restricts the ability of out-of-state wineries to do so violate the dormant Commerce Clause in light of § 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment?’ ” 541 U.S. 1062, 124 S.Ct. 2389, 158 L.Ed.2d 962 (2004).  For ease of exposition, we refer to the respondents from the Michigan challenge (Nos. 03–1116 and 03–1120) and the petitioners in the New York challenge (No. 03–1274) collectively as the wineries. We refer to their opposing parties—Michigan, New York, and the wholesalers and retailers—simply as the States. IIATime and again this Court has held that, in all but the narrowest circumstances, state laws violate the Commerce Clause if they mandate “differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.” Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U.S. 93, 99, 114 S.Ct. 1345, 128 L.Ed.2d 13 (1994). See also New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 274, 108 S.Ct. 1803, 100 L.Ed.2d 302 (1988). This rule is essential to the foundations of the Union. The mere fact of nonresidence should not foreclose a producer in one State from access to markets in other States. H.P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 539, 69 S.Ct. 657, 93 L.Ed. 865 (1949). States may not enact laws that burden out-of-state producers or shippers simply to give a competitive advantage to in-state businesses. This mandate “reflect[s] a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the Articles of Confederation.” Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322, 325–326, 99 S.Ct. 1727, 60 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979).  The rule prohibiting state discrimination against interstate commerce follows also from the principle that States should not be compelled to negotiate with each other regarding favored or disfavored status for their own citizens. States do not need, and may not attempt, to negotiate with other States regarding their mutual economic interests. Cf. U.S. Const., Art. I, § 10, cl. 3. Rivalries among the States are thus kept to a minimum, and a proliferation of trade zones is prevented. See C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383, 390, 114 S.Ct. 1677, 128 L.Ed.2d 399 (1994) (citing The Federalist No. 22, pp. 143–145 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A.Hamilton); Madison, Vices of the Political System of the United States, in 2 Writings of James Madison 362–363 (G. Hunt ed.1901)).  Laws of the type at issue in the instant cases contradict these principles. They deprive citizens of their right to have access to the markets of other States on equal terms. The perceived necessity for reciprocal sale privileges risks generating the trade rivalries and animosities, the alliances and exclusivity, that the Constitution and, in particular, the Commerce Clause were designed to avoid. State laws that protect local wineries have led to the enactment of statutes under which some States condition the right of out-of-state wineries to make direct wine sales to in-state consumers on a reciprocal right in the shipping State. California, for example, passed a reciprocity law in 1986, retreating from the State's previous regime that allowed unfettered direct shipments from out-of-state wineries. Riekhof & Sykuta, 27 Regulation, No. 3, at 30. Prior to 1986, all but three States prohibited direct shipments of wine. The obvious aim of the California statute was to open the interstate direct-shipping market for the State's many wineries. Ibid. The current patchwork of laws—with some States banning direct shipments altogether, others doing so only for out-of-state wines, and still others requiring reciprocity—is essentially the product of an ongoing, low-level trade war. Allowing States to discriminate against out-of-state wine “invite [s] a multiplication of preferential trade areas destructive of the very purpose of the Commerce Clause.” Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U.S. 349, 356, 71 S.Ct. 295, 95 L.Ed. 329 (1951). See also Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511, 521–523, 55 S.Ct. 497, 79 L.Ed. 1032 (1935). BThe discriminatory character of the Michigan system is obvious. Michigan allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, subject only to a licensing requirement. Out-of-state wineries, whether licensed or not, face a complete ban on direct shipment. The differential treatment requires all out-of-state wine, but not all in-state wine, to pass through an in-state wholesaler and retailer before reaching consumers. These two extra layers of overhead increase the cost of out-of-state wines to Michigan consumers. The cost differential, and in some cases the inability to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from the Michigan market.  The New York regulatory scheme differs from Michigan's in that it does not ban direct shipments altogether. Out-of-state wineries are instead required to establish a distribution operation in New York in order to gain the privilege of direct shipment. N.Y. ABC Law §§ 3(37), 96 (West Supp.2005). This, though, is just an indirect way of subjecting out-of-state wineries, but not local ones, to the three-tier system. New York and those allied with its interests defend the scheme by arguing that an out-of-state winery has the same access to the State's consumers as in-state wineries: All wine must be sold through a licensee fully accountable to New York; it just so happens that in order to become a licensee, a winery must have a physical presence in the State. There is some confusion over the precise steps out-of-state wineries must take to gain access to the New York market, in part because no winery has run the State's regulatory gauntlet. New York's argument, in any event, is unconvincing.  The New York scheme grants in-state wineries access to the State's consumers on preferential terms. The suggestion of a limited exception for direct shipment from out-of-state wineries does nothing to eliminate the discriminatory nature of New York's regulations. In-state producers, with the applicable licenses, can ship directly to consumers from their wineries. §§ 76–a(3), 76(4), and 77(2) (West 2000). Out-of-state wineries must open a branch office and warehouse in New York, additional steps that drive up the cost of their wine. §§ 3(37), 96 (West Supp.2005). See also App. in No. 03–1274, pp. 159–160 (Affidavit of Thomas G. McKeon, General Counsel to the New York State Liquor Authority). For most wineries, the expense of establishing a bricks-and-mortar distribution operation in 1 State, let alone all 50, is prohibitive. It comes as no surprise that not a single out-of-state winery has availed itself of New York's direct-shipping privilege. We have “viewed with particular suspicion state statutes requiring business operations to be performed in the home State that could more efficiently be performed elsewhere.” Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 145, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970). New York's in-state presence requirement runs contrary to our admonition that States cannot require an out-of-state firm “to become a resident in order to compete on equal terms.” Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Reily, 373 U.S. 64, 72, 83 S.Ct. 1201, 10 L.Ed.2d 202 (1963). See also Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 20 L.Ed. 449 (1871).  In addition to its restrictive in-state presence requirement, New York discriminates against out-of-state wineries in other ways. Out-of-state wineries that establish the requisite branch office and warehouse in New York are still ineligible for a “farm winery” license, the license that provides the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers. N.Y. ABC Law § 76–a(5) (West Supp.2005) (“No licensed farm winery shall manufacture or sell any wine not produced exclusively from grapes or other fruits or agricultural products grown or produced in New York state”). Out-of-state wineries may apply only for a commercial winery license. See §§ 3(37), 76. Unlike farm wineries, however, commercial wineries must obtain a separate certificate from the state liquor authority authorizing direct shipments to consumers, § 77(2) (West 2000); and, of course, for out-of-state wineries there is the additional requirement of maintaining a distribution operation in New York. New York law also allows in-state wineries without direct-shipping licenses to distribute their wine through other wineries that have the *476 applicable licenses. § 76(5) (West Supp.2005). This is another privilege not afforded out-of-state wineries.  We have no difficulty concluding that New York, like Michigan, discriminates against interstate commerce through its direct-shipping laws. IIIState laws that discriminate against interstate commerce face “a virtually per se rule of invalidity.” Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U.S. 617, 624, 98 S.Ct. 2531, 57 L.Ed.2d 475 (1978). The Michigan and New York laws by their own terms violate this proscription. The two States, however, contend their statutes are saved by § 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment, which provides:  “The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.”  The States' position is inconsistent with our precedents and with the Twenty-first Amendment's history. Section 2 does not allow States to regulate the direct shipment of wine on terms that discriminate in favor of in-state producers. ABefore 1919, the temperance movement fought to curb the sale of alcoholic beverages one State at a time. The movement made progress, and many States passed laws restricting or prohibiting the sale of alcohol. This Court upheld state laws banning the production and sale of alcoholic beverages, Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 8 S.Ct. 273, 31 L.Ed. 205 (1887), but was less solicitous of laws aimed at imports. In a series of cases before ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment the Court, relying on the Commerce Clause, invalidated a number of state liquor regulations.  These cases advanced two distinct principles. First, the Court held that the Commerce Clause prevented States from discriminating against imported liquor. Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 58, 17 S.Ct. 265, 41 L.Ed. 632 (1897); Walling v. Michigan, 116 U.S. 446, 6 S.Ct. 454, 29 L.Ed. 691 (1886); Tiernan v. Rinker, 102 U.S. 123, 26 L.Ed. 103 (1880). In Walling, for example, the Court invalidated a Michigan tax that discriminated against liquor imports by exempting sales of local products. The Court held that States were not free to pass laws burdening only out-of-state products:  “A discriminating tax imposed by a State operating to the disadvantage of the products of other States when introduced into the first mentioned State, is, in effect, a regulation in restraint of commerce among the States, and as such is a usurpation of the power conferred by the Constitution upon the Congress of the United States.” 116 U.S., at 455, 6 S.Ct. 454.  Second, the Court held that the Commerce Clause prevented States from passing facially neutral laws that placed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. Rhodes v. Iowa, 170 U.S. 412, 18 S.Ct. 664, 42 L.Ed. 1088 (1898); Vance v. W.A. Vandercook Co., 170 U.S. 438, 18 S.Ct. 674, 42 L.Ed. 1100 (1898); Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U.S. 100, 10 S.Ct. 681, 34 L.Ed. 128 (1890); Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 125 U.S. 465, 8 S.Ct. 689, 31 L.Ed. 700 (1888). For example, in Bowman, 125 U.S. 465, 8 S.Ct. 689, 31 L.Ed. 700 (1888), the Court struck down an Iowa statute that required all liquor importers to have a permit. Bowman and its progeny rested in part on the since-rejected original-package doctrine. Under this doctrine goods shipped in interstate commerce were immune from state regulation while in their original package. As the Court explained in Vance:  “[T]he power to ship merchandise from one State into another carries with it, as an incident, the right in the receiver of the goods to sell them in the original packages, any state regulation to the contrary notwithstanding; that is to say, that the goods received by Interstate Commerce remain under the shelter of the Interstate Commerce clause of the Constitution, until by a sale in the original package they have been commingled with the general mass of property in the State.” 170 U.S., at 444–445, 18 S.Ct. 674.  Bowman reserved the question whether a State could ban the sale of imported liquor altogether. 125 U.S., at 499–500, 8 S.Ct. 689. Iowa responded to Bowman by doing just that but was thwarted once again. In Leisy, supra, the Court held that Iowa could not ban the sale of imported liquor in its original package.  Leisy left the States in a bind. They could ban the production of domestic liquor, Mugler, supra, but these laws were ineffective because out-of-state liquor was immune from any state regulation as long as it remained in its original package, Leisy, supra. To resolve the matter, Congress passed the Wilson Act (so named for Senator Wilson of Iowa), which empowered the States to regulate imported liquor on the same terms as domestic liquor:  “That all fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquors or liquids transported into any State or Territory or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale or storage therein, shall upon arrival in such State or Territory be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such State or Territory enacted in the exercise of its police powers, to the same extent and in the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in such State or Territory, and shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in original packages or otherwise.” Ch. 728, 26 Stat. 313 (codified at 27 U.S.C. § 121).  By its own terms, the Wilson Act did not allow States to discriminate against out-of-state liquor; rather, it allowed States to regulate imported liquor only “to the same extent and in the same manner” as domestic liquor.  The Court confirmed this interpretation in Scott, supra. Scott involved a constitutional challenge to South Carolina's dispensary law, 1895 S.C. Acts p. 721, which required that all liquor sales be channeled through the state liquor commissioner. 165 U.S., at 92, 17 S.Ct. 265. The statute discriminated against out-of-state manufacturers in two primary ways. First, § 15 required the commissioner to “purchase his supplies from the brewers and distillers in this State when their product reaches the standard required by this Act: Provided, Such supplies can be purchased as cheaply from such brewers and distillers in this State as elsewhere.” 1895 S.C. Acts p. 732. Second, § 23 of the statute limited the State's markup on locally produced wines to a 10–percent profit but provided “no such limitation of charge in the case of imported wines.” 165 U.S., at 93, 17 S.Ct. 265. Based on these discriminatory provisions, the Court rejected the argument that the South Carolina dispensary law was authorized by the Wilson Act. Id., at 100, 17 S.Ct. 265. It explained that the Wilson Act was “not intended to confer upon any State the power to discriminate injuriously against the products of other States in articles whose manufacture and use are not forbidden, and which are therefore the subjects of legitimate commerce.” Ibid. To the contrary, the Court said, the Wilson Act mandated “equality or uniformity of treatment under state laws,” ibid., and did not allow South Carolina to provide “an unjust preference” to its products “as against similar products of the other States,” id., at 101, 17 S.Ct. 265. The dissent also understood the validity of the dispensary law to turn in large part on §§ 15 and 23, but argued that even if these provisions were discriminatory the correct remedy was to sever them from the rest of the Act. Id., at 104–106, 17 S.Ct. 265 (opinion of Brown, J.).  Although the Wilson Act increased the States' authority to police liquor imports, it did not solve all their problems. In Vance and Rhodes—two cases decided soon after Scott—the Court made clear that the Wilson Act did not authorize States to prohibit direct shipments for personal use. In Vance, the Court characterized Scott as embodying two distinct holdings: First, the South Carolina dispensary law “amount[ed] to an unjust discrimination against liquors, the products of other States.” 170 U.S., at 442, 18 S.Ct. 674. This aspect of the Scott holding, which confirmed the Wilson Act's nondiscrimination principle, was based “on particular provisions of the law by which the discrimination was brought about.” 170 U.S., at 442, 18 S.Ct. 674. Second, “in so far as the law then in question forbade the sending ... of intoxicating liquors for the use of the person to whom it was shipped, the statute was repugnant to [the Commerce Clause].” Ibid. (citing Scott, 165 U.S. 58, 17 S.Ct. 265, 41 L.Ed. 632). See also 170 U.S., at 443, 18 S.Ct. 674 (distinguishing between the provisions at issue in Scott “which were held to operate a discrimination” and those which barred direct shipment for personal use).  This second holding, that consumers had the right to receive alcoholic beverages shipped in interstate commerce for personal use, was only implicit in Scott. 165 U.S., at 78, 99–100, 17 S.Ct. 265. The Court expanded on this point, however, not only in Vance but again in Rhodes. Rhodes construed the Wilson Act narrowly to avoid interference with this right. The Act, the Court said, authorized States to regulate only the resale of imported liquor, not direct shipment to consumers for personal use. 170 U.S., at 421, 18 S.Ct. 664. Without a clear indication from Congress that it intended to allow States to ban such shipments, the Rhodes Court read the words “upon arrival” in the Wilson Act as authorizing “the power of the State to attach to an interstate commerce shipment, only after its arrival at the point of destination and delivery there to the consignee.” Id., at 426, 18 S.Ct. 664. See also id., at 424, 18 S.Ct. 664; Bridenbaugh v. Freeman–Wilson, 227 F.3d 848, 852 (C.A.7 2000). The Court interpreted the Wilson Act to overturn Leisy but leave Bowman intact. Rhodes, supra, at 423–424, 18 S.Ct. 664. The right to regulate did not attach until the liquor was in the hands of the customer. As a result, the mail-order liquor trade continued to thrive. Rogers, Interstate Commerce in Intoxicating Liquors Before the Webb–Kenyon Act, 4 Va. L.Rev. 353, 364–365 (1917).  After considering a series of bills in response to the Court's reading of the Wilson Act, Congress responded to the direct-shipment loophole in 1913 by enacting the Webb–Kenyon Act, 37 Stat. 699, 27 U.S.C. § 122. See Rogers, supra, at 363–370. The Act, entitled “An Act Divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate character in certain cases,” provides:  “That the shipment or transportation ... of any spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor of any kind, from one State ... into any other State ... which said spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor is intended, by any person interested therein, to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used, either in the original package or otherwise, in violation of any law of such State ... is hereby prohibited.” 37 Stat., at 699–700.  The constitutionality of the Webb–Kenyon Act itself was in doubt. Vance and Rhodes implied that any law authorizing the States to regulate direct shipments for personal use would be an unlawful delegation of Congress' Commerce Clause powers. Indeed, President Taft, acting on the advice of Attorney General Wickersham, vetoed the Act for this specific reason. S.Rep. No. 103, 63d Cong., 1st Sess., 3–6 (1913); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 88 (1913). Congress overrode the veto and in Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., 242 U.S. 311, 37 S.Ct. 180, 61 L.Ed. 326 (1917), a divided Court upheld the Webb–Kenyon Act against a constitutional challenge.  The Court construed the Act to close the direct-shipment gap left open by the Wilson Act. States were now empowered to forbid shipments of alcohol to consumers for personal use, provided that the States treated in-state and out-of-state liquor on the same terms. Id., at 321–322, 37 S.Ct. 180 (noting that the West Virginia law at issue in Clark Distilling “forbade the shipment into or transportation of liquor in the State whether from inside or out”). The Court understood that *482 the Webb–Kenyon Act “was enacted simply to extend that which was done by the Wilson Act.” Id., at 324, 37 S.Ct. 180. The Act's purpose “was to prevent the immunity characteristic of interstate commerce from being used to permit the receipt of liquor through such commerce in States contrary to their laws, and thus in effect afford a means by subterfuge and indirection to set such laws at naught.” Ibid. The Court thus recognized that the Act was an attempt to eliminate the regulatory advantage, i.e., its immunity characteristic, afforded imported liquor under Bowman and Rhodes.  Michigan and New York now argue the Webb–Kenyon Act went even further and removed any barrier to discriminatory state liquor regulations. We do not agree. First, this reading of the Webb–Kenyon Act conflicts with that given the statute in Clark Distilling. Clark Distilling recognized that the Webb–Kenyon Act extended the Wilson Act to allow the States to intercept liquor shipments before those shipments reached the consignee. The States' contention that the Webb–Kenyon Act also reversed the Wilson Act's prohibition on discriminatory treatment of out-of-state liquors cannot be reconciled with Clark Distilling's description of the Webb–Kenyon Act's purpose—“simply to extend that which was done by the Wilson Act.” 242 U.S., at 324, 37 S.Ct. 180. See also McCormick & Co. v. Brown, 286 U.S. 131, 140–141, 52 S.Ct. 522, 76 L.Ed. 1017 (1932).  The statute's text does not compel a different result. The Webb–Kenyon Act readily can be construed as forbidding “shipment or transportation” only where it runs afoul of the State's generally applicable laws governing receipt, possession, sale, or use. Cf. id., at 141, 52 S.Ct. 522 (noting that the Act authorized enforcement of “valid” state laws). At the very least, the Webb–Kenyon Act expresses no clear congressional intent to depart from the principle, unexceptional at the time the Act was passed and still applicable today, Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, 539 U.S. 59, 66, 123 S.Ct. 2142, 156 L.Ed.2d 54 (2003), that discrimination against out-of-state goods is disfavored. Cf.  Western & Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization of Cal., 451 U.S. 648, 652–653, 101 S.Ct. 2070, 68 L.Ed.2d 514 (1981) (holding that the McCarran–Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1011 et seq., removed all dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny of state insurance laws; § 1011 provides: “Congress hereby declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest, and that silence on the part of the Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several States”).  Last, and most importantly, the Webb–Kenyon Act did not purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes States from discriminating. If Congress' aim in passing the Webb–Kenyon Act was to authorize States to discriminate against out-of-state goods then its first step would have been to repeal the Wilson Act. It did not do so. There is no inconsistency between the Wilson Act and the Webb–Kenyon Act sufficient to warrant an inference that the latter repealed the former. See Washington v. Miller, 235 U.S. 422, 428, 35 S.Ct. 119, 59 L.Ed. 295 (1914) (noting that implied repeals are disfavored). Indeed, this Court has twice noted that the Wilson Act remains in effect today. Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp., 377 U.S. 324, 333, n. 11, 84 S.Ct. 1293, 12 L.Ed.2d 350 (1964); Department of Revenue v. James B. Beam Distilling Co., 377 U.S. 341, 345, n. 7, 84 S.Ct. 1247, 12 L.Ed.2d 362 (1964). See 27 U.S.C. § 121.  The Wilson Act reaffirmed, and the Webb–Kenyon Act did not displace, the Court's line of Commerce Clause cases striking down state laws that discriminated against liquor produced out of state. The rule of Tiernan, Walling, and Scott remained in effect: States were required to regulate domestic and imported liquor on equal terms. “[T]he intent of ... the Webb–Kenyon Act ... was to take from intoxicating liquor the protection of the interstate commerce laws in so far as necessary to deny them an advantage over the intoxicating liquors produced in the state into which they were brought, yet, [the Act does not] show an intent or purpose to so abdicate control over interstate commerce as to permit discrimination against the intoxicating liquor brought into one state from another.” Pacific Fruit & Produce Co. v. Martin, 16 F.Supp. 34, 39–40 (W.D.Wash.1936). See also Friedman, Constitutional Law: State Regulation of Importation of Intoxicating Liquor Under Twenty-first Amendment, 21 Cornell L.Q. 504, 509 (1936) (“The cases under the Webb–Kenyon Act uphold state prohibition and regulation in the exercise of the police power yet they clearly forbid laws which discriminate arbitrarily and unreasonably against liquor produced outside of the state” (footnote omitted)). BThe ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919 provided a brief respite from the legal battles over the validity of state liquor regulations. With the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment 14 years later, however, nationwide Prohibition came to an end. Section 1 of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment. Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment is at issue here.  Michigan and New York say the provision grants to the States the authority to discriminate against out-of-state goods. The history we have recited does not support this position. To the contrary, it provides strong support for the view that § 2 restored to the States the powers they had under the Wilson and Webb–Kenyon Acts. “The wording of § 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment closely follows the Webb–Kenyon and Wilson Acts, expressing the framers' clear intention of constitutionalizing the Commerce Clause framework established under those statutes.” Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 205–206, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976) (footnote omitted).  The aim of the Twenty-first Amendment was to allow States to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation, and use. The Amendment did not give States the authority to pass nonuniform laws in order to discriminate against out-of-state goods, a privilege they had not enjoyed at any earlier time.  Some of the cases decided soon after ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment did not take account of this history and were inconsistent with this view. In State Bd. of Equalization of Cal. v. Young's Market Co., 299 U.S. 59, 62, 57 S.Ct. 77, 81 L.Ed. 38 (1936), for example, the Court rejected the argument that the Amendment did not authorize discrimination:  “The plaintiffs ask us to limit this broad command [of § 2]. They request us to construe the Amendment as saying, in effect: The State may prohibit the importation of intoxicating liquors provided it prohibits the manufacture and sale within its borders; but if it permits such manufacture and sale, it must let imported liquors compete with the domestic on equal terms. To say that, would involve not a construction of the Amendment, but a rewriting of it.”  The Court reaffirmed the States' broad powers under § 2 in a series of cases, see Mahoney v. Joseph Triner Corp., 304 U.S. 401, 58 S.Ct. 952, 82 L.Ed. 1424 (1938); Indianapolis Brewing Co. v. Liquor Control Comm'n, 305 U.S. 391, 59 S.Ct. 254, 83 L.Ed. 243 (1939); Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves, 308 U.S. 132, 60 S.Ct. 163, 84 L.Ed. 128 (1939); Joseph S. Finch & Co. v. McKittrick, 305 U.S. 395, 59 S.Ct. 256, 83 L.Ed. 246 (1939), and unsurprisingly many States used the authority bestowed on them by the Court to expand trade barriers. T. Green, Liquor Trade Barriers: Obstructions to Interstate Commerce in Wine, Beer, and Distilled Spirits 4, and App. I (1940) (stating in the wake of Young's Market that “[r]ivalries and reprisals have thus flared up”).  It is unclear whether the broad language in Young's Market was necessary to the result because the Court also stated that “the case [did] not present a question of discrimination prohibited by the commerce clause.” 299 U.S., at 62, 57 S.Ct. 77. The Court also declined, contrary to the approach we take today, to consider the history underlying the Twenty-first Amendment. Id., at 63–64, 57 S.Ct. 77. This reluctance did not, however, reflect a consensus that such evidence was irrelevant or that prior history was unsupportive of the principle that the Amendment did not authorize discrimination against out-of-state liquors. There was ample opinion to the contrary. See, e.g.,  Young's Market Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization of Cal., 12 F.Supp. 140 (S.D.Cal.1935), (per curiam), rev'd, 299 U.S. 59, 57 S.Ct. 77, 81 L.Ed. 38 (1936); Pacific Fruit & Produce Co. v. Martin, supra, at 39; Joseph Triner Corp. v. Arundel, 11 F.Supp. 145, 146–147 (D.Minn.1935); Friedman, supra, at 511–512; Note, Recent Cases, Twenty-first Amendment—Commerce Clause, 85 U. Pa. L.Rev. 322, 323 (1937); W. Hamilton, Price and Price Policies 426 (1938); Note, Legislation, Liquor Control, 38 Colum. L.Rev. 644, 658 (1938); Wiser & Arledge, Does the Repeal Amendment Empower a State to Erect Tariff Barriers and Disregard the Equal Protection Clause in Legislating on Intoxicating Liquors in Interstate Commerce? 7 Geo. Wash. L.Rev. 402, 407–409 (1939); De Ganahl, The Scope of Federal Power Over Alcoholic Beverages Since the Twenty-first Amendment, 8 Geo. Wash. L.Rev. 819, 822–828 (1940); Note, 55 Yale L.J. 815, 819–820 (1946).  Our more recent cases, furthermore, confirm that the Twenty-first Amendment does not supersede other provisions of the Constitution and, in particular, does not displace the rule that States may not give a discriminatory preference to their own producers. CThe modern § 2 cases fall into three categories.  First, the Court has held that state laws that violate other provisions of the Constitution are not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment. The Court has applied this rule in the context of the First Amendment, 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 116 S.Ct. 1495, 134 L.Ed.2d 711 (1996); the Establishment Clause, Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U.S. 116, 103 S.Ct. 505, 74 L.Ed.2d 297 (1982); the Equal Protection Clause, Craig, supra, at 204–209, 97 S.Ct. 451; the Due Process Clause, *487  Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971); and the Import–Export Clause, Department of Revenue v. James B. Beam Distilling Co., 377 U.S. 341, 84 S.Ct. 1247, 12 L.Ed.2d 362 (1964).  Second, the Court has held that § 2 does not abrogate Congress' Commerce Clause powers with regard to liquor. Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U.S. 691, 104 S.Ct. 2694, 81 L.Ed.2d 580 (1984); California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 100 S.Ct. 937, 63 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980). The argument that “the Twenty-first Amendment has somehow operated to ‘repeal’ the Commerce Clause” for alcoholic beverages has been rejected. Hostetter, 377 U.S., at 331–332, 84 S.Ct. 1293. Though the Court's language in Hostetter may have come uncommonly close to hyperbole in describing this argument as “an absurd oversimplification,” “patently bizarre,” and “demonstrably incorrect,” ibid., the basic point was sound.  Finally, and most relevant to the issue at hand, the Court has held that state regulation of alcohol is limited by the nondiscrimination principle of the Commerce Clause. Bacchus, 468 U.S., at 276, 104 S.Ct. 3049; Brown—Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U.S. 573, 106 S.Ct. 2080, 90 L.Ed.2d 552 (1986); Healy v. Beer Institute, 491 U.S. 324, 109 S.Ct. 2491, 105 L.Ed.2d 275 (1989). “When a state statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests, we have generally struck down the statute without further inquiry.” Brown–Forman, supra, at 579, 106 S.Ct. 2080.  Bacchus provides a particularly telling example of this proposition. At issue was an excise tax enacted by Hawaii that exempted certain alcoholic beverages produced in that State. The Court rejected the argument that Hawaii's discrimination against out-of-state liquor was authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment. 468 U.S., at 274–276, 104 S.Ct. 3049. “The central purpose of the [Amendment] was not to empower States to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.” Id., at 276, 104 S.Ct. 3049. Despite attempts to distinguish it in the instant cases, Bacchus forecloses any contention that § 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes discriminatory direct-shipment laws from Commerce Clause scrutiny. See also Brown–Forman, supra, at 576, 106 S.Ct. 2080 (invalidating a New York price affirmation statute that required producers to limit the price of liquor based on the lowest price they offered out of state); Healy, 491 U.S., at 328, 109 S.Ct. 2491 (invalidating a similar Connecticut statute); id., at 344, 109 S.Ct. 2491 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“The Connecticut statute's invalidity is fully established by its facial discrimination against interstate commerce .... This is so despite the fact that the law regulates the sale of alcoholic beverages, since its discriminatory character eliminates the immunity afforded by the Twenty-first Amendment”).  Recognizing that Bacchus is fatal to their position, the States suggest it should be overruled or limited to its facts. As the foregoing analysis makes clear, we decline their invitation. Furthermore, Bacchus does not stand alone in recognizing that the Twenty-first Amendment did not give the States complete freedom to regulate where other constitutional principles are at stake. A retreat from Bacchus would also undermine Brown–Forman and Healy. These cases invalidated state liquor regulations under the Commerce Clause. Indeed, Healy explicitly relied on the discriminatory character of the Connecticut price affirmation statute. 491 U.S., at 340–341, 109 S.Ct. 2491. Brown–Forman and Healy lend significant support to the conclusion that the Twenty-first Amendment does not immunize all laws from Commerce Clause challenge.  The States argue that any decision invalidating their direct-shipment laws would call into question the constitutionality of the three-tier system. This does not follow from our holding. “The Twenty-first Amendment grants the States virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system.” Midcal, supra, at 110, 100 S.Ct. 937. A State which chooses to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol altogether could bar its importation; and, as our history shows, it would have to do so to make its laws effective. States may also assume direct control of liquor distribution through state-run outlets or funnel sales through the three-tier system. We have previously recognized that the three-tier system itself is “unquestionably legitimate.” North Dakota v. United States, 495 U.S., at 432, 110 S.Ct. 1986. See also id., at 447, 110 S.Ct. 1986 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (“The Twenty-first Amendment ... empowers North Dakota to require that all liquor sold for use in the State be purchased from a licensed in-state wholesaler”). State policies are protected under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent. The instant cases, in contrast, involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers. The discrimination is contrary to the Commerce Clause and is not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment. IVOur determination that the Michigan and New York direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment does not end the inquiry. We still must consider whether either state regime “advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.” New Energy Co. of Ind., 486 U.S., at 278, 108 S.Ct. 1803. The States offer two primary justifications for restricting direct shipments from out-of-state wineries: keeping alcohol out of the hands of minors and facilitating tax collection. We consider each in turn.  The States, aided by several amici, claim that allowing direct shipment from out-of-state wineries undermines their ability to police underage drinking. Minors, the States argue, have easy access to credit cards and the Internet and are likely to take advantage of direct wine shipments as a means of obtaining alcohol illegally.  The States provide little evidence that the purchase of wine over the Internet by minors is a problem. Indeed, there is some evidence to the contrary. A recent study by the staff of the FTC found that the 26 States currently allowing direct shipments report no problems with minors' increased access to wine. FTC Report 34. This is not surprising for several reasons. First, minors are less likely to consume wine, as opposed to beer, wine coolers, and hard liquor. Id., at 12. Second, minors who decide to disobey the law have more direct means of doing so. Third, direct shipping is an imperfect avenue of obtaining alcohol for minors who, in the words of the past president of the National Conference of State Liquor Administrators, “ ‘want instant gratification.’ ” Id., at 33, and n. 137 (explaining why minors rarely buy alcohol via the mail or the Internet). Without concrete evidence that direct shipping of wine is likely to increase alcohol consumption by minors, we are left with the States' unsupported assertions. Under our precedents, which require the “clearest showing” to justify discriminatory state regulation, C & A Carbone, Inc., 511 U.S., at 393, 114 S.Ct. 1677, this is not enough.  Even were we to credit the States' largely unsupported claim that direct shipping of wine increases the risk of underage drinking, this would not justify regulations limiting only out-of-state direct shipments. As the wineries point out, minors are just as likely to order wine from in-state producers as from out-of-state ones. Michigan, for example, already allows its licensed retailers (over 7,000 of them) to deliver alcohol directly to consumers. Michigan counters that it has greater regulatory control over in-state producers than over out-of-state wineries. This does not justify Michigan's discriminatory ban on direct shipping. Out-of-state wineries face the loss of state and federal licenses if they fail to comply with state law. This provides strong incentives not to sell alcohol to minors. In addition, the States can take less restrictive steps to minimize the risk that minors will order wine by mail. For example, the Model Direct Shipping Bill developed by the National Conference of State Legislatures requires an adult signature on delivery and a label so instructing on each package.  The States' tax-collection justification is also insufficient. Increased direct shipping, whether originating in state or out of state, brings with it the potential for tax evasion. With regard to Michigan, however, the tax-collection argument is a diversion. That is because Michigan, unlike many other States, does not rely on wholesalers to collect taxes on wines imported from out of state. Instead, Michigan collects taxes directly from out-of-state wineries on all wine shipped to in-state wholesalers. Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1725(2) (1989) (“Each outside seller of wine shall submit ... a wine tax report of all wine sold, delivered, or imported into this state during the preceding calendar month”). If licensing and self-reporting provide adequate safeguards for wine distributed through the three-tier system, there is no reason to believe they will not suffice for direct shipments.  New York and its supporting parties also advance a tax-collection justification for the State's direct-shipment laws. While their concerns are not wholly illusory, their regulatory objectives can be achieved without discriminating against interstate commerce. In particular, New York could protect itself against lost tax revenue by requiring a permit as a condition of direct shipping. This is the approach taken by New York for in-state wineries. The State offers no reason to believe the system would prove ineffective for out-of-state wineries. Licensees could be required to submit regular sales reports and to remit taxes. Indeed, various States use this approach for taxing direct interstate wine shipments, e.g., N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 178.27 (Lexis Supp.2004), and report no problems with tax collection. See FTC Report 38–40. This is also the procedure sanctioned by the National Conference of State Legislatures in their Model Direct *492 Shipping Bill. See, e.g., S.C.Code Ann. § 61–4–747(C) (West Supp.2004).  Michigan and New York benefit, furthermore, from provisions of federal law that supply incentives for wineries to comply with state regulations. The Tax and Trade Bureau (formerly the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) has authority to revoke a winery's federal license if it violates state law. BATF Industry Circular 96–3 (1997). Without a federal license, a winery cannot operate in any State. See 27 U.S.C. § 204. In addition the Twenty-first Amendment Enforcement Act gives state attorneys general the power to sue wineries in federal court to enjoin violations of state law. § 122a(b).  These federal remedies, when combined with state licensing regimes, adequately protect States from lost tax revenue. The States have not shown that tax evasion from out-of-state wineries poses such a unique threat that it justifies their discriminatory regimes.  Michigan and New York offer a handful of other rationales, such as facilitating orderly market conditions, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory accountability. These objectives can also be achieved through the alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement. FTC Report 40–41. Finally, it should be noted that improvements in technology have eased the burden of monitoring out-of-state wineries. Background checks can be done electronically. Financial records and sales data can be mailed, faxed, or submitted via e-mail.  In summary, the States provide little concrete evidence for the sweeping assertion that they cannot police direct shipments by out-of-state wineries. Our Commerce Clause cases demand more than mere speculation to support discrimination against out-of-state goods. The “burden is on the State to show that ‘the discrimination is demonstrably justified,’ ” Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U.S. 334, 344, 112 S.Ct. 2009, 119 L.Ed.2d 121 (1992) (emphasis in original). The Court has upheld state regulations that discriminate against interstate commerce only after finding, based on concrete record evidence, that a State's nondiscriminatory alternatives will prove unworkable. See, e.g.,  Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 141–144, 106 S.Ct. 2440, 91 L.Ed.2d 110 (1986). Michigan and New York have not satisfied this exacting standard. VStates have broad power to regulate liquor under § 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment. This power, however, does not allow States to ban, or severely limit, the direct shipment of out-of-state wine while simultaneously authorizing direct shipment by in-state producers. If a State chooses to allow direct shipment of wine, it must do so on evenhanded terms. Without demonstrating the need for discrimination, New York and Michigan have enacted regulations that disadvantage out-of-state wine producers. Under our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, these regulations cannot stand.  We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit; and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with our opinion. It is so ordered."

She was just a young thin pale soft shy slim slip of a thing then, sauntering, by silvamoonlake and he was a heavy trudging lurching lieabroad of a Curraghman, making his hay for whose sun to shine on, as tough as the oaktrees (peats be with them!) used to rustle that time down by the dykes of killing Kildare, for forstfellfoss with a plash across her. She thought she’s sankh neathe the ground with nymphant shame when he gave her the tigris eye! O happy fault! Me wish it was he! You’re wrong there, corribly wrong! Tisn’t only tonight you’re anacheronistic! It was ages behind that when nullahs were nowhere, in county Wickenlow, garden of Erin, before she ever dreamt she’d lave Kilbride and go foaming under Horsepass bridge, with the great southerwestern windstorming her traces and the midland’s grain-waster asarch for her track, to wend her ways byandby, robecca or worse, to spin and to grind, to swab and to thrash, for all her golden lifey in the barleyfields and pennylotts of Humphrey’s fordofhurdlestown and lie with a landleaper, wellingtonorseher. Alesse, the lagos of girly days! For the dove of the dunas! Was-ut? Izod? Are you sarthin suir? Not where the Finn fits into the Mourne, not where the Nore takes lieve of Blþm, not where the Braye divarts the Farer, not where the Moy changez her minds twixt Cullin and Conn tween Cunn and Collin? Or where Neptune sculled and Tritonville rowed and leandros three bumped heroines two? Neya, narev, nen, nonni, nos ! Then whereabouts in Ow and Ovoca? Was it yst with wyst or Lucan Yokan or where the hand of man has never set foot? Dell me where, the fairy ferse time! I will if you listen. You know the dinkel dale of Luggelaw? Well, there once dwelt a local heremite, Michael Arklow was his river-end name, (with many a sigh I aspersed his lavabibs!) and one venersderg in junojuly, oso sweet and so cool and so limber she looked, Nance the Nixie, Nanon L’Escaut, in the silence, of the sy-comores, all listening, the kindling curves you simply can’t stop feeling, he plunged both of his newly anointed hands, the core of his cushlas, in her singimari saffron strumans of hair, parting them and soothing her and mingling it, that was deepdark and ample like this red bog at sundown. By that Vale Vowclose’s lucydlac, the reignbeau’s heavenarches arronged orranged her. Afroth-dizzying galbs, her enamelled eyes indergoading him on to the vierge violetian. Wish a wish! Why a why? Mavro! Letty Lerck’s lafing light throw those laurals now on her daphdaph teasesong petrock. Maass! But the majik wavus has elfun anon meshes. And Simba the Slayer of his Oga is slewd. He cuddle not help himself, thurso that hot on him, he had to forget the monk in the man so, rubbing her up and smoothing her down, he baised his lippes in smiling mood, kiss akiss after kisokushk (as he warned her niver to, niver to, nevar) on Anna-na-Poghue’s of the freckled forehead. While you’d parse secheressa she hielt her souff’. But she ruz two feet hire in her aisne aestumation. And steppes on stilts ever since. That was kissuahealing with bantur for balm! O, wasn’t he the bold priest? And wasn’t she the naughty Livvy? Nautic Naama’s now her navn. Two lads in scoutsch breeches went through her before that, Barefoot Burn and Wallowme Wade, Lugnaquillia’s noblesse pickts, before she had a hint of a hair at her fanny to hide or a bossom to tempt a birch canoedler not to mention a bulgic porterhouse barge. And ere that again, leada, laida, all unraidy, too faint to buoy the fairiest rider, too frail to flirt with a cygnet’s plume, she was licked by a hound, Chirripa–Chirruta, while poing her pee, pure and simple, on the spur of the hill in old Kippure, in birdsong and shearingtime, but first of all, worst of all, the wiggly livvly, she sideslipped out by a gap in the Devil’s glen while Sally her nurse was sound asleep in a sloot and, feefee fiefie, fell over a spillway before she found her stride and lay and wriggled in all the stag-nant black pools of rainy under a fallow coo and she laughed innocefree with her limbs aloft and a whole drove of maiden hawthorns blushing and looking askance upon her.  Drop me the sound of the findhorn’s name, Mtu or Mti, som-bogger was wisness. And drip me why in the flenders was she frickled. And trickle me through was she marcellewaved or was it weirdly a wig she wore. And whitside did they droop their glows in their florry, aback to wist or affront to sea? In fear to hear the dear so near or longing loth and loathing longing? Are you in the swim or are you out? O go in, go on, go an! I mean about what you know. I know right well what you mean. Rother! You’d like the coifs and guimpes, snouty, and me to do the greasy jub on old Veronica’s wipers. What am I rancing now and I’ll thank you? Is it a pinny or is it a surplice? Arran, where’s your nose? And where’s the starch? That’s not the vesdre bene-diction smell. I can tell from here by their eau de Colo and the scent of her oder they’re Mrs Magrath’s. And you ought to have aird them. They’ve moist come off her. Creases in silk they are, not crampton lawn. Baptiste me, father, for she has sinned! Through her catchment ring she freed them easy, with her hips’ hurrahs for her knees’dontelleries. The only parr with frills in old the plain. So they are, I declare! Welland well! If tomorrow keeps fine who’ll come tripping to sightsee? How’ll? Ask me next what I haven’t got! The Belvedarean exhibitioners. In their cruisery caps and oarsclub colours. What hoo, they band! And what hoa, they buck! And here is her nubilee letters too. Ellis on quay in scarlet thread. Linked for the world on a flush-caloured field. Annan exe after to show they’re not Laura Ke — own’s. O, may the diabolo twisk your seifety pin! You child of Mammon, Kinsella’s Lilith! Now who has been tearing the leg of her drawars on her? Which leg is it? The one with the bells on it. Rinse them out and aston along with you! Where did I stop? Never stop! Continuarration! You’re not there yet. I amstel waiting. Garonne, garonne!  Well, after it was put in the Mericy Cordial Mendicants’ Sitter-dag-Zindeh–Munaday Wakeschrift (for once they sullied their white kidloves, chewing cuds after their dinners of cheeckin and beggin, with their show us it here and their mind out of that and their when you’re quite finished with the reading matarial), even the snee that snowdon his hoaring hair had a skunner against him. Thaw, thaw, sava, savuto! Score Her Chuff Exsquire! Everywhere erriff you went and every bung you arver dropped into, in cit or suburb or in addled areas, the Rose and Bottle or Phoenix Tavern or Power’s Inn or Jude’s Hotel or wherever you scoured the countryside from Nannywater to Vartryville or from Porta Lateen to the lootin quarter you found his ikom etsched tipside down or the cornerboys cammocking his guy and Morris the Man, with the role of a royss in his turgos the turrible, (Evro-peahahn cheic house, unskimmed sooit and yahoort, hamman now cheekmee, Ahdahm this way make, Fatima, half tum!) reeling and railing round the local as the peihos piped und uban-jees twanged, with oddfellow’s triple tiara busby rotundarinking round his scalp. Like Pate-by-the-Neva or Pete-over-Meer. This is the Hausman all paven and stoned, that cribbed the Cabin that never was owned that cocked his leg and hennad his Egg. And the mauldrin rabble around him in areopage, fracassing a great bingkan cagnan with their timpan crowders. Mind your Grimm-father! Think of your Ma! Hing the Hong is his jove’s hang — nomen! Lilt a bolero, bulling a law! She swore on croststyx nyne wyndabouts she’s be level with all the snags of them yet. Par the Vulnerable Virgin’s Mary del Dame! So she said to herself she’d frame a plan to fake a shine, the mischiefmaker, the like of it you niever heard. What plan? Tell me quick and dongu so crould! What the meurther did she mague? Well, she bergened a zakbag, a shammy mailsack, with the lend of a loan of the light of his lampion, off one of her swapsons, Shaun the Post, and then she went and consulted her chapboucqs, old Mot Moore, Casey’s Euclid and the Fashion Display and made herself tidal to join in the mascarete. O gig goggle of gigguels. I can’t tell you how! It’s too screaming to rizo, rabbit it all! Minneha, minnehi mina-aehe, minneho! O but you must, you must really! Make my hear it gurgle gurgle, like the farest gargle gargle in the dusky dirgle dargle! By the holy well of Mulhuddart I swear I’d pledge my chanza getting to heaven through Tirry and Killy’s mount of impiety to hear it all, aviary word! O, leave me my faculties, woman, a while! If you don’t like my story get out of the punt. Well, have it your own way, so. Here, sit down and do as you’re bid. Take my stroke and bend to your bow. Forward in and pull your overthepoise! Lisp it slaney and crisp it quiet. Deel me long-some. Tongue your time now. Breathe thet deep. Thouat’s the fairway. Hurry slow and scheldt you go. Lynd us your blessed ashes here till I scrub the canon’s underpants. Flow now. Ower more. And pooleypooley.  First she let her hair fal and down it flussed to her feet its teviots winding coils. Then, mothernaked, she sampood herself with galawater and fraguant pistania mud, wupper and lauar, from crown to sole. Next she greesed the groove of her keel, warthes and wears and mole and itcher, with antifouling butter-scatch and turfentide and serpenthyme and with leafmould she ushered round prunella isles and eslats dun, quincecunct, allover her little mary. Peeld gold of waxwork her jellybelly and her grains of incense anguille bronze. And after that she wove a gar-land for her hair. She pleated it. She plaited it. Of meadowgrass and riverflags, the bulrush and waterweed, and of fallen griefs of weeping willow. Then she made her bracelets and her anklets and her armlets and a jetty amulet for necklace of clicking cobbles and pattering pebbles and rumbledown rubble, richmond and rehr, of Irish rhunerhinerstones and shellmarble bangles. That done, a dawk of smut to her airy ey, Annushka Lutetiavitch Pufflovah, and the lellipos cream to her lippeleens and the pick of the paintbox for her pommettes, from strawbirry reds to extra violates, and she sendred her boudeloire maids to His Affluence, Ciliegia Grande and Kirschie Real, the two chirsines, with respecks from his missus, seepy and sewery, and a request might she passe of him for a minnikin. A call to pay and light a taper, in Brie-on-Arrosa, back in a sprizzling. The cock striking mine, the stalls bridely sign, there’s Zambosy waiting for Me! She said she wouldn’t be half her length away. Then, then, as soon as the lump his back was turned, with her mealiebag slang over her shulder, Anna Livia, oysterface, forth of her bassein came.  Describe her! Hustle along, why can’t you? Spitz on the iern while it’s hot. I wouldn’t miss her for irthing on nerthe. Not for the lucre of lomba strait. Oceans of Gaud, I mosel hear that! Ogowe presta! Leste, before Julia sees her! Ishekarry and washe-meskad, the carishy caratimaney? Whole lady fair? Duodecimo — roon? Bon a ventura? Malagassy? What had she on, the liddel oud oddity? How much did she scallop, harness and weights? Here she is, Amnisty Ann! Call her calamity electrifies man.  No electress at all but old Moppa Necessity, angin mother of injons. I’ll tell you a test. But you must sit still. Will you hold your peace and listen well to what I am going to say now? It might have been ten or twenty to one of the night of Allclose or the nexth of April when the flip of her hoogly igloo flappered and out toetippit a bushman woman, the dearest little moma ever you saw, nodding around her, all smiles, with ems of embarras and aues to awe, between two ages, a judyqueen, not up to your elb. Quick, look at her cute and saise her quirk for the bicker she lives the slicker she grows. Save us and tagus! No more? Werra where in ourthe did you ever pick a Lambay chop as big as a battering ram? Ay, you’re right. I’m epte to forgetting, Like Liviam Liddle did Loveme Long. The linth of my hough, I say! She wore a ploughboy’s nailstudded clogs, a pair of ploughfields in themselves: a sugarloaf hat with a gaudyquiviry peak and a band of gorse for an arnoment and a hundred streamers dancing off it and a guildered pin to pierce it: owlglassy bicycles boggled her eyes: and a fishnetzeveil for the sun not to spoil the wrinklings of her hydeaspects: potatorings boucled the loose laubes of her laudsnarers: her nude cuba stockings were salmospotspeckled: she sported a galligo shimmy of hazevaipar tinto that never was fast till it ran in the washing: stout stays, the rivals, lined her length: her bloodorange bockknickers, a two in one garment, showed natural nigger boggers, fancyfastened, free to undo: her black-stripe tan joseph was sequansewn and teddybearlined, with wavy rushgreen epaulettes and a leadown here and there of royal swansruff: a brace of gaspers stuck in her hayrope garters: her civvy codroy coat with alpheubett buttons was boundaried round with a twobar tunnel belt: a fourpenny bit in each pocketside weighed her safe from the blowaway windrush; she had a clothes-peg tight astride on her joki’s nose and she kep on grinding a sommething quaint in her fiumy mouth and the rrreke of the fluve of the tail of the gawan of her snuffdrab siouler’s skirt trailed ffiffty odd Irish miles behind her lungarhodes.  Hellsbells, I’m sorry I missed her! Sweet gumptyum and no-body fainted! But in whelk of her mouths? Was her naze alight? Everyone that saw her said the dowce little delia looked a bit queer. Lotsy trotsy, mind the poddle! Missus, be good and don’t fol in the say! Fenny poor hex she must have charred. Kickhams a frumpier ever you saw! Making mush mullet’s eyes at her boys dobelon. And they crowned her their chariton queen, all the maids. Of the may? You don’t say! Well for her she couldn’t see herself. I recknitz wharfore the darling murrayed her mirror. She did? Mersey me! There was a koros of drouthdropping sur- facemen, boomslanging and plugchewing, fruiteyeing and flower-feeding, in contemplation of the fluctuation and the undification of her filimentation, lolling and leasing on North Lazers’ Waal all eelfare week by the Jukar Yoick’s and as soon as they saw her meander by that marritime way in her grasswinter’s weeds and twigged who was under her archdeaconess bonnet, Avondale’s fish and Clarence’s poison, sedges an to aneber, Wit-upon-Crutches to Master Bates: Between our two southsates and the granite they’re warming, or her face has been lifted or Alp has doped!  But what was the game in her mixed baggyrhatty? Just the tembo in her tumbo or pilipili from her pepperpot? Saas and taas and specis bizaas. And where in thunder did she plunder? Fore the battle or efter the ball? I want to get it frisk from the soorce. I aubette my bearb it’s worth while poaching on! Shake it up, do, do! That’s a good old son of a ditch! I promise I’ll make it worth your while. And I don’t mean maybe. Nor yet with a goodfor. Spey me pruth and I’ll tale you true.  Well, arundgirond in a waveney lyne aringarouma she pattered and swung and sidled, dribbling her boulder through narrowa mosses, the diliskydrear on our drier side and the vilde vetchvine agin us, curara here, careero there, not knowing which medway or weser to strike it, edereider, making chattahoochee all to her ain chichiu, like Santa Claus at the cree of the pale and puny, nistling to hear for their tiny hearties, her arms encircling Isola-bella, then running with reconciled Romas and Reims, on like a lech to be off like a dart, then bathing Dirty Hans’ spatters with spittle, with a Christmas box apiece for aisch and iveryone of her childer, the birthday gifts they dreamt they gabe her, the spoiled she fleetly laid at our door! On the matt, by the pourch and inunder the cellar. The rivulets ran aflod to see, the glashaboys, the pollynooties. Out of the paunschaup on to the pyre. And they all about her, juvenile leads and ingenuinas, from the slime of their slums and artesaned wellings, rickets and riots, like the Smyly boys at their vicereine’s levee. Vivi vienne, little Annchen! Vielo Anna, high life! Sing us a sula, O, susuria! Ausone sidulcis! Hasn’t she tambre! Chipping her and raising a bit of a chir or a jary every dive she’d neb in her culdee sacco of wabbash she raabed and reach out her maundy meerschaundize, poor souvenir as per ricorder and all for sore aringarung, stinkers and heelers, laggards and primelads, her furzeborn sons and dribblederry daughters, a thousand and one of them, and wickerpotluck for each of them.

Only snuffers’ cornets drifts my way that the cracka dvine chucks out of his cassock, with her estheryear’s marsh narcissus to make him recant his vanitty fair. Foul strips of his chinook’s bible I do be reading, dodwell disgustered but chickled with chuckles at the tittles is drawn on the tattlepage. Senior ga dito: Faciasi Omo! E omo fu fo. Ho! Ho!

Ja, a swamp for Alt-muehler and a stone for his flossies! I know how racy they move his wheel. My hands are blawcauld between isker and suda like that piece of pattern chayney there, lying below. Or where is it? Lying beside the sedge I saw it. Hoangho, my sorrow, I’ve lost it! Aimihi! With that turbary water who could see? So near and yet so far! But O, gihon! I lovat a gabber.

And sure he was the quare old buntz too, Dear Dirty Dumpling, foostherfather of fingalls and dotthergills. Gammer and gaffer we’re all their gangsters. Hadn’t he seven dams to wive him?

In 1889, when Minkowski and von Mering discovered that complete extirpation of the pancreas leads to fatal diabetes, practically nothing was known concerning the significance of the ductless glands, and few conceived that it would be possible to extract, from various of them, substances capable of replacing the lost function, when administered to animals from which some particular gland had been removed. Although, at this time, it was known that the thyroid gland is atrophied in myxoedema and in cretinism, it was not until 1892 that Murray discovered that administration of the gland removes the symptoms, and it was only later that the doctrine of internal secretions, first enunciated by Claude Bernard in 1856 in connection with the production of sugar by the liver, came to take its place in physiological teaching. Minkowski in the complete account of his researches, published in 1893, considered the antidiabetic function of the pancreas to be dependent upon its acting as a ductless gland, and no doubt he had in mind that it performed this through an internal secretion, although the positive statement that such exists was first made by Lepine, who thought that it took the form of a glycolytic enzyme. But, so far, there was no hint as to the actual structure within the pancreas upon which the antidiabetic influence of the gland depends and it is primarily to the anatomists, Laguesse and Diamare, that we owe the hypothesis that this must be the collection of cells, named after their discoverer, the isles of Langerhans. By careful studies of the cytological characteristics of the cells of these islets, as distinguished from those of the much more numerous secreting acini among which they lie, and by painstaking examination of the anatomical relationships of the two kinds of cells in different classes of vertebrates, Laguesse and Diamare concluded that the islets must be responsible for the antidiabetic influence.  As this anatomical work was in progress, the potent action of extracts of the suprarenal gland on the blood pressure and other physiological functions was discovered, in 1894, by Oliver and Schafer, thus adding strong support to the hypothesis that the ductless glands function by producing internal secretions. The hypothesis, that the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas must act in a similar manner, gained a firm hold among physiologists and clinical workers, with the result that many attempted to alleviate the symptoms of diabetes by administration of pancreas, or of extracts of the gland, to patients suffering from the disease. No success attended these attempts partly, we believe, because the antidiabetic principle was destroyed, either during the preparation of the extracts or by the action of the digestice juices, and partly, because of imperfect knowledge of the clinical course of the disease, particularly with regard to the relationship of diet to it. Notwithstanding the failure of these attempts, the hypothesis that the isles of Langerhans are the structures to which the pancreas owes its antidiabetic function was still maintained, and indeed strengthened, by the supporting evidence furnished by the graft experiments of Minkowski and Hédon. These workers showed that no diabetic symptoms supervene in dogs when a portion of the pancreas is transplanted into the wall of the abdomen prior to, or at the same time as, removal of the remainder of the gland, but immediately do so in full intensity when this graft is subsequently excised. Moreover, it was known that ligation of the ducts of the pancreas, or their injection by oil or paraffin, is not followed by diabetes. Since, in neither of these types of experiment, can any of the digestive secretion gain the intestine it was clear that the anti-diabetic function of the pancreas must be independent of its digestive function. It may be well to point out also that the graft experiments once and for all disproved the view held by some (by Pflüger, for example), that damage to the nerve structures adjacent to the pancreas, or in the duodenal wall, is responsible for the diabetic symptoms.  A distinct step forward was taken in 1900 when Schulze and Ssobolev discovered that the degenerative changes which follow ligation of the ducts affect the cells of the acini much more markedly than those of the islets, and although among those who repeated these researches, there were some who failed to corroborate the findings, the conclusions of Schulze and Ssobolev were generally accepted. It was not long after this that the first, though unsuccessful, attempt was made to see whether an extract of the degenerated residue of duct-ligated pancreas might not relieve the symptoms of diabetes. About this time also (1906) - as was revealed in 1922 by the opening of a sealed package deposited with the Société de Biologie - Gley had found similar extracts to diminish the symptoms in diabetic dogs, and in the same year, Miss Dewitt had tried their effects on glycolysis.  The insular hypothesis of diabetes was meanwhile strongly supported by the careful histological studies of the pancreas of patients who had died from the disease (Opie) for, although it had been known, even prior to the experiments of Minkowski and von Mering, that the gland is often the seat of morbid change, it was not realized that the islets are the structures which are chiefly affected.  In 1903-1904, Rennie, by anatomical studies in certain Teleostei, gave strong support to the view of Diamare, that the islet cells in these fishes exist as separate glands of relatively large size and more or less independent of the pancreatic acini. Both workers attempted to demonstrate an effect of extracts of these glands on sugar or starch solutions, but without success. They administered them by mouth to diabetic patients with no favourable results, although in one case, in which an extract was given subcutaneously, there was decided alleviation of the diabetic symptoms (Rennie and Fraser).  About this time the significance of internal secretions in the control of animal functions was clearly demonstrated by the discovery of secretin by Bayhss and Starling (1902), and the term ""hormone"" came into use to designate their active principles. Many believed that the antidiabetic function of the pancreas must depend on a hormone secreted by the isles of Langerhans, but neither the graft experiments already referred to, nor the transfusion experiments of Hédon - in which it was found that when the blood of a normal dog was transfused in a diabetic one the symptoms were alleviated - could prove the hypothesis. To do this it was necessary to- show that extracts of the islets, or at least of the pancreas, are capable of removing the symptoms of diabetes. In 1907 Zuelzer published results which must be considered, in the light of what we now know, as really demonstrating the presence of the antidiabetic hormone in alcoholic extracts of pancreas. But unfortunately, even although several diabetic patients were benefited by administration of the extracts, the investigations were not sufficiently completed to convince others, and, apparently, Zuelzer himself was discouraged in continuing them because of toxic reactions in the treated patients.  To describe, even in mere outline, the further attempts to prepare active antidiabetic extracts of the pancreas would far exceed the limits of this essay. To Knowlton and Starling, Meltzer and Kleiner, E. L. Scott, Murlin and Cramer, and to Clark, we owe much, for although none of these investigators succeeded in demonstrating beyond doubt that an extract having antidiabetic properties could be prepared from the pancreas, they all obtained results which were sufficiently positive to keep alive the hope that some day this would be possible. Special reference must also be made to the more recent work of Paulesco who prepared extracts having very decided effects on the sugar and the urea of the blood of diabetic animals.  Believing that the want of success to prepare extracts of uniform potency as due to the destruction of the antidiabetic hormone by the digestive enzymes also present in the gland, F. G. Banting suggested preparing them from duct-ligated pancreas, and with the aid of C. H. Best, and under my direction, he succeeded in 1922 in showing that such extracts reduced the hyperglycaemia and glycosuria in depancreatized dogs. The general symptoms of diabetes were also found to be alleviated and the duration of life of the depancreatized animal prolonged, by the repeated injection of alcoholic extracts of foetal, as well as of adultox pancreas. Later it was shown, in collaboration with Collip, that other symptoms of diabetes, namely the ketonuria and the absence of glycogen from the liver, were favourably influenced by the extracts and, with Hepburn, that the respiratory quotient became raised. These results on depancreatized dogs showed beyond doubt that the antidiabetic hormone was present in potent form in the extracts, and the time seemed ripe to investigate their action on the clinical forms of diabetes. This was done by Banting in a severe case under the care of W. R. Campbell, with the result that the hyperglycaemia and glycosuria were diminished. At the same time, however, it was found that it would be necessary to rid the extracts of irritating substances before the value of their repeated injection in the treatment of diabetes in man could be adequately put to the test. This was accomplished by Collip, and the name insulin was decided upon for the purified extract. This name had previously been suggested by Sir E. Sharpey Schafer (1916), who had been one of the first to support the hypothesis of the insular derivation of the antidiabetic hormone. I need not here detail the rapid progress which it was now possible to make in studying the therapeutic value of insulin in the treatment of diabetes in man; for it is with experimental aspects of the subject that this essay is concerned.  The invariable lowering of the blood sugar which was observed to result from the administration of insulin in animals rendered diabetic by pancreatectomy, raised the question as to whether such would also occur in those forms of hyperglycaemia which can be induced by other experimental procedures, such as the injection of epinephrin, piqûre, or asphyxia. As the first step in the investigation of this question, Collip injected insulin into normal rabbits and found the blood sugar to become lowered, thus furnishing a valuable method for testing the potency of various preparations and, therefore, for affording a basis for their physiological assay. At the same time it was found that neither piqûre, nor epinephrin, nor asphyxia caused any hyperglycaemia in rabbits in which, as a result of injection with insulin, the blood sugar was at a low level to start with.  Peculiar symptoms (convulsions and coma) were observed in many of the injected animals, and it was soon possible to show that these were related to the lowering of the blood sugar and that they usually supervened when this was about 0.045 per cent. Sometimes the animals recovered spontaneously from these symptoms, but more frequently the coma became so profound, with marked fall of body temperature, that death occurred. That the lowering of blood sugar is closely related to the occurrence of the symptoms, was proved by finding that the subcutaneous injection of a solution of glucose was followed, almost immediately, by complete recovery, even in cases in which death was imminent from deep coma. It has been found, in collaboration with Noble, that glucose is remarkably specific in this regard, the only other sugar which approaches it being mannose and, in certain animals, such as the mouse, maltose. Laevulose and galactose are decidedly inferior in their antidoting action, the pentoses are entirely inactive and none of the disaccharides, other than maltose, has any effect. It is evident that this specificity in the action of glucose, in combating the hypoglycaemic symptoms, offers an opportunity to determine, not only what related substances are readily converted into glucose in the animal body, but also what groupings in the glucose molecule itself are significant for the effects. By substituting various side chains in the molecule, as for example, by methyl groups, it has been found, in collaboration with Herring and Irvine, that none of these substitution products is effective, even such compounds as the mono-methylglucosides being entirely inactive.  The fall in blood sugar is dependent upon increased diffusion of sugar into the tissues and not to its more rapid destruction in the blood itself. Thus, Eadie and I could detect no change in the rate of glycolysis by adding insulin to blood incubated under sterile conditions outside the body, or in blood withdrawn from animals injected some minutes before death with insulin. Hepburn and Latchford, on the other hand, demonstrated that the addition of insulin to the fluid perfused through the excised mammalian heart markedly increased the rate at which the percentage of sugar became diminished in it.  The striking relationship between the concentration of glucose in the blood and the normal functioning of the nervous system, which is revealed by these observations, had already been noted by Mann and Magath in their experiments on hepatectomized dogs. They observed that when the blood sugar fell to about 0.045 per cent, characteristic symptoms supervened which could be antidoted by glucose, and to a less extent, by laevulose and mannose. We must conclude that when the tension of glucose in the tissue cells falls below a certain level (glucatonia), a condition of irritability becomes developed; but little is known as to what the underlying cause for this may be. Olmsted and Logan have advanced some evidence that it may depend on interference with the process of oxidation in the nerve cells, or that these are irritated by substances produced elsewhere in the body by faulty oxidation. More recent experiments by Argyll Campbell on the tension of oxygen in the tissues lend support to this view.  These observations emphasize the great importance of a certain tension of glucose within the tissue cells. They help us to understand why it is that the concentration of this sugar in the circulating fluids of animals of every order and species in which it has been determined, varies only within narrow limits, even after prolonged periods of starvation, or following muscular exercise.  We must imagine that it is by lowering the tension of glucose within the tissue cells that insulin primarily acts, so that the glucose of the blood plasma, with which the tissue glucose is in equilibrium, diffuses into the cells to maintain the tension. With Eadie we have found that the free glucose extractable from the muscles by warm alcohol is reduced following the injecting of insulin, but we know nothing of the fate of the glucose which disappears. It is not converted into glycogen (McCormick, Noble and Macleod, Dudley and Marrian, Cori, etc.) nor is it immediately oxidized, since the respiratory metabolism (intake 0, and respiratory quotient) does not become increased at the time when the blood sugar is falling (Eadie, Dickson, Macleod, and Pember; Trevan and Boock; Krogh; Boothby and Wilder, etc.)1.  Although the intake of oxygen may become greater in certain animals such as dogs, cats, and man when hypoglycaemic symptoms make their appearance, this does not occur when sugar is also administered. In the light of these results we have concluded that the glucose which disappears must become converted into some hitherto unidentified substance, but we have been unable to obtain any clue as to what this substance may be. Large amounts of it must be formed to account for the enormous quantities of glucose which may vanish from the blood, as when glucose is injected along with insulin. We have, for example, injected into rabbits, in the course of eight hours, as much as 10 grams of glucose per kilo body weight along with insulin, without finding, at the end, any increase in blood sugar, or in the free or the combined sugar of the muscles or liver. Burn and Dale have also shown that very large quantities of glucose can be injected along with insulin into eviscerated animals without increasing the percentage of the blood sugar. It is conceivable that between glucose and the material which is finally oxidized in the tissues there exists, not one, but a group of substances constantly changing from one into another in an equilibrated system, and that no one of them ever accumulates in sufficient quantity to make its identification possible by available chemical methods.  Be this as it may, it is significant that the percentage of inorganic phosphoric acid in the blood declines at the same rate as the sugar, although, in the recovery process, the phosphoric acid begins to rise decidedly before the sugar in animals injected with insulin. Accompanying this fall in the phosphates of the blood, those of the urine entirely disappear for several hours and then return to considerably above the normal level so that, in urine collected throughout the 24 hours, an excess is excreted, as compared with the amount on days during which no insulin is given. (Winter and Smith, Allan and Sokhey, etc.). These facts would seem to indicate that in the process responsible for the disappearance of glucose in the tissues there is a stage when compounds of phosphoric acid with sugar or its immediate breakdown products are formed. One immediately thinks of the possibility that an increase in the amount of the substance, described by Embden and his school, in muscle, and named lactacidogen, might be responsible, but we have been unable to demonstrate that this is the case (Eadie, Macleod, and Noble). At the present time we are entirely at a loss to account for the disappearing glucose. When this problem is solved it may be anticipated that a great advance will become possible in our knowledge of the intermediary metabolism of the carbohydrates.  Having outlined the known facts with regard to its physiological action, we may now turn to the interesting question of the source of insulin. The observations of Banting and Best, that simple extracts of the residue of pancreas remaining several weeks after the ducts are tied possess antidiabetic properties, does not necessarily prove that insulin is derived from the islets. As Bensley and others have shown there may still remain, at this period after duct-ligation, a considerable amount of more or less normal acinar tissue. Even were the gland allowed to degenerate for a sufficient time so that all acinar tissue had disappeared - which is considerably over a year in the rabbit - it would be difficult, in the event that extracts of the residue still contained insulin, to be certain that this insulin is not of the type which it is possible to extract from various materials, including even the tissues of depancreatized animals, as Best and Scott have shown.  Further investigation of the problem was therefore undertaken by continuing the work of Diamare and Rennie on certain of the Teleostei, such as Lophius and Myoxocephalus, in which the islet cells exist apart from the acinar tissue, as the so-called ""principal islets"". Extracts were made by alcohol from these structures, as well as from the acinar tissue, and it was found that, whereas very large yields of insulin are readily obtainable from the islets, little or none at all can usually be prepared from the pancreas itself. Indeed, extracts of the latter sometimes cause the blood sugar of rabbits to become raised, instead of lowered. The lowering of the blood sugar by acinar extracts when it occurred, may have been due to the presence of a few scattered microscopic islets, such as have been observed by Slater Jackson to exist in the pancreatic bands of Myoxocephalus. That the principal islet may have some acinar tissue associated with it does not detract from the value of the foregoing observations as evidence supporting the insular hypothesis, since it has been shown that extracts of the acinar tissue are comparatively impotent. In this connection it is of interest to note that insulin can be readily prepared from the pancreas of the Elasmobranchi (Raja and Squalus), which occurs as a compact gland with the islet tissue included in it, much in the same manner as in the mammalian pancreas.  But in view of the fact that insulin, or at least extracts capable of lowering the blood sugar in normal rabbits, can be prepared from other tissues than the pancreas or the principal islets, there still remains the possibility that it might be secreted internally from some of these. It is indeed possible that although this did not occur in the normal animal, in which a sufficient amount was coming from the pancreas, it might occur when the normal. secretion was cut off, as in diabetes. By such a vicarious functioning of extra-pancreatic potential sources of insulin, the tolerance of the diabetic organism for carbohydrate might become raised. It seemed important, therefore, to see whether diabetes would result from excision of the principal islets alone, an operation which is possible in Myoxocephalus, the two principal islets being readily removable without exposure of the fish to air for more than 15 minutes.  In a large number of fish in which this operation was performed, it was found, in collaboration with McCormick, that the blood sugar became raised, often to ten times the normal value. At this high level it remained so long as the fish were kept alive - 11 days in one case, 5-10 days in others. The hyperglycaemia in itself was not sufficient to prove that the fish had become diabetic as a result of the isletectomy, for it was found, in other fish that were exposed to air for a period equal to that required for the operation (about 15 minutes), that the blood sugar rose, sometimes almost as much as in the operated ones. This asphyxial hyperglycaemia, however, was found to disappear within four days2, nor while it lasted was it so pronounced as in the isletectomized fish. There is no doubt that removal of the islets in Myoxocephalus causes pronounced diabetes, as judged by the behaviour of the blood sugar, and, it is of interest to add that there was, on an average, considerably more fat and less glycogen present in the liver of the operated fish than in those of the controls. It remains to determine whether, by giving insulin to the isletectomized fish, the blood sugar can be brought down to the normal level. So far we have been unable to demonstrate any very potent influence of insulin on the blood sugar of normal fish, although there is some indication that it can retard the development of asphyxial hyperglycaemia.  Taking all the evidence into consideration the conclusion seems justified that the only source from which physiologically effective insulin can be secreted within the animal body is the islet tissue.  And finally permit me to say something concerning the behaviour of depancreatized animals kept alive by means of insulin. By such studies it is possible that we may be able to determine whether the lost power to utilize carbohydrate can be reacquired in any measure, and also whether the secretion of pancreatic juice and of insulin include all the functions of the gland. With the collaboration of Frank N. Allan, I. L. Chaikoff, J. Markowitz, and W. W. Simpson, several completely depancreatized dogs have now been kept alive, by daily injections of insulin, for many months, the operation on * one of them, which is at present under observation, having been performed over eighteen months ago. But this result was not immediately achieved.  In the earlier observations it was observed that, notwithstanding the fact that the animals ate large amounts of meat, the body weight steadily fell, no doubt because of inadequate intestinal digestion and absorption. The addition of cane sugar, in amounts sufficient to cause a mild degree of glycosuria (50 to 100 g daily), had the immediate effect of preventing the loss of body weight, and in most animals, of causing it to become increased, especially when large amounts were given. Four of these animals lived in excellent nutritive condition for periods varying between one and seven months, when each in turn developed symptoms of acute jaundice (bile pigment in urine, yellowing of sclera and skin) accompanied by rise in rectal temperature, anuria and progressive bodily weakness, ending fatally in from two to three days after the onset. The post mortem examination revealed, in each case, an extremely fatty liver with no significant pathological changes elsewhere in the body. Under the microscope it was difficult to see any liver cells that were not completely filled with fat, except for a few towards the centres of the lobules which were only moderately invaded. In some way or other, absence of the pancreas leads to a fatal breakdown of the hepatic function. Two possibilities may be considered: the one, that the pancreas secretes internally, besides insulin, some other hormone which is necessary for the functional integrity of the liver, perhaps a hormone having to do with its action on fat metabolism; and the other, that in the absence of the pancreatic ferments, the process of intestinal digestion becomes of such a (bacterial) type that substances having a toxic effect on the liver cells are absorbed into the portal blood. It was therefore decided to add raw ox pancreas (50 g) to the daily diet, and it is as an outcome of this addition that the animals have thrived without showing any symptoms of hepatic breakdown. This favourable result may be dependent either on the restoration of the pancreatic enzymes, thus preventing the development of toxic substances, or because some hormone which withstands digestive action is absorbed from the ingested gland. We are at present observing the effect of adding trypsin to the food, instead of raw pancreas, but although the animal thus treated is in excellent nutritive condition we cannot as yet say whether it may not ultimately develop the hepatic symptoms. It may be added that the toxic theory is supported by the observation that in the absence of raw pancreas, or trypsin, not more than fifty per cent of the ingested meat is assimilated, whereas over eighty per cent is assimilated when either of these is present.  The carbohydrate balance is being determined at intervals in several diabetic animals, in order to see whether any of the lost power to secrete insulin may be reacquired. This is done by determining the proportion of the ingested sugar which reappears in the urine daily while the animals are under the same dose of insulin, but so far no change has been detected. While it is certain that any considerable reacquirement of the power to secrete insulin would be revealed by this method, it is possible that a very scanty secretion might be masked on account of the relatively large amounts administered daily from without, for it has been shown, by Frank N. Allan, that the glucose equivalent of each unit of insulin is very much higher when the total number of units administered is small than when it is large. Another method for investigating this problem remains available, namely to observe whether the diabetic symptoms which supervene when insulin is discontinued are less severe after several months treatment than they are soon after the removal of the pancreas. Our attempts to make this observation have, so far, been frustrated by the very rapid downward progress of the animals after discontinuing insulin. Unless they are given large quantities of meat they die in a few days of symptoms not unlike those of diabetic coma.  It has been stated by Carlson and Drennan that the diabetic symptoms are very much less than usual when pancreatectomy is performed on pregnant animals near full time, and this they have attributed to the secretion of insulin from the foetal pancreas. We could obtain no evidence in support of this hypothesis in the present investigations. Thus, one of the depancreatized dogs gave birth to five pups without any change whatsoever in her sugar balance throughout the pregnancy, although, on the day after the pups were born, severe symptoms of hypoglycaemia developed, no doubt because of the removal of glucose from the body to form the lactose of the milk. There was therefore no evidence that the developing foetuses contributed any significant amount of insulin to the maternal organism. In the face of the relatively large amounts of insulin injected into the mother, however, it is possible, in view of Allan's results, that the small contribution from the foetuses could have no measurable influence on the maternal sugar balance.  I have attempted to review but a small part of the work relating to insulin and have only cursorily referred to the perplexing problem of the mechanism of its action in the animal body. Facts of importance in this regard come almost daily to light and it is to be anticipated that, as these accumulate, a great advance will become possible in our knowledge of the history of carbohydrates in the animal body.    1. Practically all observers have confirmed the observation first made by Dickson and Pember that the R. Q. (respiratory quotient) rises somewhat in normal animals injected with insulin but the extent of this rise is not sufficient to indicate that increased combustio of glucose can be the significant cause for the rapid reduction in blood sugar.  2. There was one fish in which the blood sugar remained at a high level even eight days after asphyxia.

Nos impele a seguir. Siempre la brega deja un poco de fiebre sobre el alma, en la frente un fulgor, y en la pupila la radiante visión de las etapas; etapas de dolor, hechas teorías de credos inefables, de parábolas de lengua incomprendida que pasasen en la locomoción de las audacias, ¡como una blanca tropa de lirismos por inmortales rutas incendiadas! Preciso es continuar. Todas las dudas que agobian la cabeza con su carga, son grilletes fatales del cerebro y su sitio mejor está en la espalda. Arrojémoslas, pues. En el avance hay un cóndor audaz que no se arrastra: cóndor es la pasión, jamás sujeta, de las vidas enfermas de ser sanas. ¡Con rumbo hacia lo azul: aunque deslumbre lo intenso de la luz, hay que mirarla! Los primeros fulgores, quemarán, tras la noche de las ansias; la primera visual que los descubra ocultos en la sombra impenetrada, así como una antorcha cuyo fuego ardiese el brazo que la levantara. ¡Insanías de amor, que los enfermos del manicomio de ese Ideal contagian!... ¡Locos, venid! Yo quiero aquí, en el canto, soltar al viento un corazón con alas: Los discretos normales podrán, sólo, arrojarnos las piedras de sus lástimas... ¡No haya vacilación! El derrotero se ha poblado de enérgicas constancias; pero, porque no siempre en el peligro hay carne de temblores libertada, también es necesario hacer que resplandezcan llamaradas, del fecundo calor de un entusiasmo, en la quietud mortal que todo embarga, ¡como una floración de primaveras en el propio pais de las escarchas! Si se llagan los pies en el camino, más firme, mucho más, será la marca: en la senda candente que cruzamos se ve mejor la huella ensangrentada. Alienten la Epopeya, los himnos fraternales de esperanza alzados entre vítores y músicas con el clamor de las protestas bravas, como un beso de paz sobre una inmensa cicatriz que dejase la jornada, y en cármenes de púrpura resurjan reventando sus fragancias ¡todas las rosas del Amor perenne que perfuman la enorme caravana! Y en el salmo coral, que sinfoniza un salvaje ciclón sobre la pauta, venga el robusto canto que presagie, con la alegre fiereza de una diana que recorriese como un verso altivo el soberbio delirio de la gama, el futuro cercano de los triunfos, futuro precursor de las revanchas; el instante supremo en que se agita la visión terrenal de las canallas, los frutos renovados en la incesante fuerza de las savias, del germen luminoso que cayera en el resurgimiento de las almas, ¡como una rubia polución de soles en el vientre del surco derramada! ¡Un ensueño en camino, que sufre la obsesión de la montaña, bajo la plenitud de las auroras que alumbran los tropiezos de la marcha! No hay obstrucción posible: es el Principio la promesa del Fin. Arde en la llama de la hoguera moral, el negro escombro de la atávica Torre de ignorancias, madre de ese temor: lo incognoscible, cuyos tupidos velos desgarrara, en la prisión intelectual más honda, — rechazando el concepto de la Nada — la verdad de la Ciencia hecha Justicia al procesar la Esfinge del Nirvana! La gesta de las causas en los siglos, no ha bordado poemas en sus páginas. El libro de los mártires no tiene sino una historia de grandezas trágicas, de sangre floreciendo en el tormento sus azucenas que parecen lacras... ¡Clarín de los suplicios cuyas voces en las generaciones se dilatan! Toda Idea fué así. ¡Dolor bendito de heridas que supuran enseñanzas! Al lado de la Cruz está la Horca, — y es bueno no quererlas separadas — ¡el leño o el dogal: hablen las épocas, pues la Cruz y la Horca son hermanas! Y por eso en la lidia, camino al porvenir de la Cruzada, coronando el pendón de las bravuras los trofeos, aun tibios, se levantan, como ejemplos viriles anunciados en la fulguración de la escarlata, desde sórdidos pulpitos sangrientos por muertos sacerdotes que aun tronaran palabras de rencor, hechas conjuros, predicando el sermón de las venganzas! Triste labor del Odio, que desata sus hordas de amenazas, diciendo su creación demoledora a las hoscas angustias de la Raza. Los tremendos instantes de la prueba saben de los martillos que no aplastan los ímpetus hermosos, más hermosos después del golpe que sobre ellos baja; y en la espera, nerviosa, del momento del derrumbe final; la última etapa, a través de las brumas sigilosas que puedan ocultar la Ciudad blanca, se descubren, allá, en otro horizonte, espléndidas auroras que se alzan, los risueños Orientes — ¡bienvenidos! — los iris eternales del mañana; ¡arcos gloriosos de los triunfos nuevos por donde toda la Epopeya pasa! Y tras el loco batallar de siglos, así como después de la jornada en infinitas gotas se traduce la honra del sudor sobre las caras, sobre las rudas frentes, pensativas como un viejo Pesar que meditara, la cicatriz de sangre se resuelve en agua de Perdón que todo lava, en agua dulce y bautismal, borrando las huellas más infames, más amargas, ¡como un Jordán de Olvido que quitase hasta el recuerdo mismo de las manchas! Preciso es continuar; cada desmayo hace ver insalvables las distancias. En la estéril noción de lo imposible, los músculos morales se relajan, y en el afán que el miedo empequeñece se ven lejos las cumbres más cercanas. La formidable voz de anunciaciones extremece el ambiente con sus vastas repercusiones de tonantes notas, cubriendo las necrópolis de calmas. La anunciación postrer que se divulga con los alertas de cerebros-guardias. ...Muertos odios que vuelven en caricias las opresiones de la lucha bárbara, ¡como una herida que revienta en flores y perfuma las vendas maculadas! ...Ya puestos en camino, no se esquiva el obstáculo: se aparta. La senda libre de cualquier tropiezo nunca fué la más digna de la planta encallecida en la ascensión penosa del breñal que la suerte deparara. Así va la legión, atravesando los últimos espacios que separan del rumbo abierto al porvenir soñado, como ruta augural, por donde marchan las sombras fugitivas del silencio, en larga proyección, cantando hosannas si triunfantes por fin, y si vencidos: cayendo frente al Sol, como las águilas!"

Situándose el buen licenciado en San Juan, envió uno tras otro hasta cinco emisarios a Enriquillo, en el espacio de un mes. Propúsole en primer lugar perdón y salvo conducto para él y sus indios si se le sometían, asegurando que el cacique y sus principales compañeros no volverían a ser encomendados a nadie; que se les darían medios de vivir holgadamente y los demás no serían obligados a trabajar sino con quien ellos quisiesen y en las faenas que fueran más de su agrado. A esta misiva contestó Enriquillo verbalmente, diciendo al enviado para que lo repitiera a Zuazo, que él no depondría las armas mientras quedara un solo indio sujeto a servidumbre en la Española. Volvió el segundo emisario de Zuazo con otro mensaje de éste, ofreciendo al cacique hacer considerar por el Almirante y su Audiencia su demanda, e instándole por una entrevista, sobre seguro que le ofrecía. Este mensajero regresó con una negativa absoluta, fundada en la irrisoria autoridad de las cartas de seguro y de favor, según la pasada experiencia con el mandamiento del juez Figueroa, menospreciado impunemente por Pedro de Badillo. Un nuevo emisario de Zuazo jamás volvió a aparecer, y se creyó generalmente que Tamayo lo toparía en el camino y le daría muerte. De aquí provino que ningún otro español quisiera encargarse de comisiones semejantes, y Zuazo hubo de valerse sucesivamente de los indios, que tampoco regresaron, ni se supo más de ellos. Comprendió por consiguiente el negociador lo infructuoso de su empeño, y entonces desplegó sus banderas el capitán Iñigo Ortiz, marchando sobre el Bahoruco al frente de una lucida y bien armada gente. En número, equipo y ordenanza militar de esta fuerza aventajaba mucho a la que sufrió el descalabro precedente, y Ortiz contaba además con dotes de mando muy superiores a las del presuntuoso e imprevisor Badillo. No entraron los expedicionarios en la formidable sierra en masa ni por un solo punto, sino que fraccionándose en tres cuerpos penetraron por otros tantos desfiladeros distintos. Llevaban perros de presa, de los cuales se prometían grande ayuda; pero salió fallida esta esperanza, y entonces pudo verse cuán acertado estuvo Enriquillo proveyéndose de cuantos animales de esa especie pudo hacer que fueran al Bahoruco. Lanzados como guías los perros de Iñigo Ortiz, muy pocos de ellos, desconociendo a los de Enriquillo, ladraron a tiempo en uno de los desfiladeros, avisando la presencia de los rebeldes. Los demás, amistosamente recibidos por los de su especie, o se pasaron voluntariamente a los indios, o fueron capturados fácilmente por Luis de la Laguna y los otros caciques entendidos y prácticos en los usos y costumbres de la raza canina. Era Matayco el cacique que estaba situado en el lugar donde ladraron los perros de Ortiz; y la tropa de éste acometió briosamente en aquella dirección: los indios resistieron con denuedo, por más de tres horas continuas; pero eran inferiores en número, y hubieron de ceder al fin la posición replegando a otra más defendida, y haciendo resonar sus caracoles con el aviso de aquella novedad. En los otros dos pasos de la montaña se combatía con éxito vario. Los españoles peleaban con resolución, y arrollaron otro puesto de indios: la posición que ocupaba el valeroso Romero estaba también a punto de caer en poder de Ortiz, después de un encarnizado combate de media hora, cuando llegó Enriquillo que, al frente de sus guerreros escogidos, cargó furiosamente el arma blanca, hizo retroceder a los agresores, y conservó el punto disputado. El eco lúgubre de los caracoles confundiéndose con el de las trompetas anunciaba sin embargo que los indios pedían auxilio en los otros desfiladeros; y Enriquillo, aprovechando su ventaja del momento sobre la hueste que Ortiz mandaba personalmente, dio a Romero instrucciones para que replegara de puesto en puesto, atrayendo al belicoso caudillo español al primer campamento por medio de una retirada gradual; mientras que el mismo Enrique daba auxilio a Matayco. Análogas instrucciones de retraerse trasmitió el cacique al destacamento del tercer paso; operación que se efectuó con mucho acierto, a la sazón que Enriquillo, cayendo sobre los que hostigaban a Matayco, lograba unirse con éste, después de causar gran destrozo en las filas enemigas, y ambos revolvían también, como en retirada, hacia el centro de la montaña. Con toda su pericia, o tal vez a causa de ella, Iñigo Ortiz que veía debilitarse otra vez le resistencia de los indios, quiso acabar su victoria lanzándose con nuevo ímpetu a ocupar lo que por noticias imperfectas consideraba como su núcleo o cuartel general. Ya Enriquillo y todos los demás indios no empeñados con Romero a contener a Ortiz, se ocupaba activamente en retirar del campamento las armas, provisiones y otros objetos útiles y de algún valor. Las mujeres, los heridos y demás seres indefensos habían mudado de sitio anticipadamente. Apenas terminado el desalojo, Enriquillo hizo la señal convenida para que Romero replegara de una vez, dejando el paso franco a Ortiz y sus valientes; disposición que fue ejecutada con tanta habilidad, que el jefe español creyó positivamente que el enemigo iba en completa derrota y que su victoria quedaba coronada con la ocupación del campamento. Eran sobre las tres de la tarde cuando esto sucedía. Iñigo Ortiz instaló su tropa en las abrigadas chozas del real indio, y viendo fatigados y hambrientos a los guerreros, dejó la persecución de los que el juzgaba fugitivos para el día siguiente. Comieron, pues; descansaron toda aquella tarde, y pasaron la noche sin ninguna otra novedad que la fantástica iluminación de las montañas vecinas con numerosas hogueras encendidas por los indios como señales. Al amanecer del nuevo día Ortiz destacó tres o cuatro rondas a reconocer diversos puntos de las inmediaciones; pero antes de media hora regresaron una en pos de otra diciendo que los pasos estaban todos ocupados por fuerzas, rebeldes considerables, y que habiendo intentado arrollar la resistencia de los indios, había sido imposible, por lo bien escogido de sus posiciones. Ortiz comenzó a entrever entonces que había caído en un lazo; mas supo disimular su recelo a fuer de prudente, y mandó reconocer los desfiladeros ocupados el día anterior. Muy pronto adquirió la certidumbre de que estaba cercado por todas partes. Penetrar más al centro de la sierra hubiera sido un desatino y el jefe español no pensó siquiera en ello. Trató solamente de romper aquella red, y formando toda su gente en masa emprendió su retirada por el desfiladero que él personalmente había forzado la víspera. Romero estaba allí otra vez, con bien armada hueste, que trabó el combate oponiéndose enérgicamente a la tropa de Ortiz, y abrumándola desde los altos riscos con toda clase de armas arrojadizas. El intrépido Ortiz asaltó con éxito una eminencia colocada entre dos despeñaderos, y allí se trabó un combate encarnizado cuerpo a cuerpo, entre indios y españoles. Estos comenzaban a dominar la resistencia por todas partes; ya algunos de los puestos de Romero estaban abandonados: sus defensores huían desbandados al ver morir a los caciques Velázquez y Maybona, que sucumbieron peleando heroicamente, cuando llegó Enriquillo con sus cincuenta guerreros escogidos, armados de lanzas y cubiertos con cotas de cuerdas. La valentía y el empuje de este oportuno socorro bastó para cambiar la faz del combate: la fuerte y pesada lanza de Enriquillo se tiñó con la sangre de más de diez enemigos; hízose al fin astillas en el férreo peto de un castellano, y el héroe continuó combatiendo con la cortante espada. Sus soldados hacían como él prodigios de audacia, y el mismo Ortiz recibió una ancha herida en el hombro izquierdo. Una parte de sus fuerzas, la que hacía de vanguardia, aprovechando la primera acometida que contrastó a Romero, siguió a paso de carga, más bien a carrera abierta, el desfiladero abajo, sin cuidarse de los toques de clarín que pedían a retaguardia su auxilio; Ortiz y los que con él estaban empeñados se creyeron perdidos; y mientras que algunos se salvaban trabajosamente, rodando por las laderas y derriscos más practicables de aquel monte, otros menos afortunados fueron a parar destrozados y exánimes al fondo de los barrancos y despeñaderos. Ortiz tuvo la dicha de librarse a costa de dos roturas de cabeza y media docena de contusiones, que sumadas con su herida de lanza hacían un total bien mísero y digno de lástima por cierto. Guiándose por las señales que hacían las trompetas de su vanguardia pudo dar con ella, que había hecho alto en una colina, ya fuera de aquella sombría garganta, que de cada árbol y de cada roca vomitaba indios armados. Ortiz, después de recoger algunos fugitivos y extraviados como él, hizo el recuento de su tropa, y halló solamente doscientos treinta hombres. El resto, hasta trescientos cincuenta que entre soldados y milicianos formaban al principio los expedicionarios, había mordido el polvo, o estaba en poder de Enriquillo. Mandó pronto aviso a la Maguana, y Zuazo le envió tres días después refuerzos, ordenándole volver sobre los rebeldes y castigarlos ejemplarmente; pero Ortiz fue de distinta opinión, y se abstuvo de penetrar otra vez en la formidable sierra, yéndose a Careybana a curar sus heridas. Allí adoleció largo tiempo. Entonces se adoptó un sistema de guerra llamado  de observación , que consistía en vigilar por medio de gruesos destacamentos los pasos de las montañas, y esperar a que los indios saliesen de sus inexpugnables guaridas, para hacerles sentir el peso de las armas de la autoridad. No podían desear nada más cómodo Enriquillo y sus súbditos. El Bahoruco quedó por algún tiempo libre de invasiones; y aunque guardando estrictamente su actitud marcial y defensiva, reinaba en el interior de aquellos agrestes y feraces montes la paz y la abundancia. Solamente el indómito Tamayo se hacía sentir muy a menudo, en saltos atrevidos que, comenzando por asolar las comarcas occidentales de la isla, fueron sucesivamente extendiéndose a la Maguana, a Compostela de Azua y a otros puntos muy distantes del Bahoruco. La seguridad y la confianza desaparecieron de todos aquellos contornos; y a favor de tan irregular estado de cosas los demás indios escapaban a la servidumbre y se iban a buscar su libertad a los bosques. Los que permanecían sujetos a sus amos o encomenderos no valían gran cosa para el trabajo, o se veían mimados por sus señores para que no los abandonasen. El desorden y la decadencia alcanzaban a todos los ámbitos de la isla y afectaban todos los intereses; y el clamor general contra las depredaciones de Tamayo, que todas se ponían a cuenta y cargo del alzamiento de Enriquillo, las autoridades contestaban que Iñigo Ortiz hacía la guerra en el Bahoruco, y que guardadas cuidadosamente todas las entradas y salidas de la sierra, Enriquillo y sus rebeldes no podían moverse, (¡en más de setenta leguas de territorio!) y habían de ser más o menos pronto exterminados. Entretanto, Alonso Zuazo se cansó de la Maguana y se volvió para Santo Domingo, llevándose consigo, por vía de precaución y con las mayores muestras de respeto, a Doña Leonor de Castilla, que no hacía misterio de su amistad con Enriquillo, y solía escribirle por medio de emisarios seguros. Iñigo Ortiz, después de sano, permaneció en Careybana, solicitando del Almirante su relevo; sus tenientes se aburrían estacionados al pie de los plutónicos estribos de la sierra, y ni los castellanos se cuidaban de hostilizar a los habitantes del Bahoruco, ni Enriquillo permitía que sus soldados inquietaran a los castellanos en sus pacíficos acantonamientos."
